0.4 <|###|> Immaculate execution in every detail of one poor conception after another... uninspired, arrogant, and lazy.
0.6 <|###|> Cool original camp. This is a fun little movie.
0.6 <|###|> It's Back to the Beach writ saucy.
0.5 <|###|> It's all enjoyable enough, but it's played so broadly that it loses whatever impact it might have had.
0.8 <|###|> Sharp satire. Great fun.
0.65 <|###|> A funny tongue-in-cheek comedy, cinematic commentary and murder mystery all rolled in to one.
0.6 <|###|> It may be fluff, but it's knowing, relatively enjoyable fluff.
0.3 <|###|> It's too much filmed theater to come alive fully on the screen.
0.7 <|###|> A promising recipe for comedy that goes flat in the execution.
0.6 <|###|> Has a great look, but its broad laughs at the expense of '50s and '60s cultural naivete aren't really all that clever.
0.6 <|###|> An enjoyable, if weightless, romp.
0.9 <|###|> Not since Rocky Horror has the film world produced such a vibrant farce of teen angst, violence, and sexual deviance.
0.8 <|###|> Wonderfully campy entertainment that doesn't ask anything of its viewers.
0.8 <|###|> The sort of movie that even today's superstars might love to slum around in.
0.625 <|###|> It's best to just relax and enjoy the Party.
0.8 <|###|> It definitively skewers the false innocence of American pop culture on the eve of the countercultural deluge.
0.7 <|###|> Frozen River is bleak and uncompromising - and that's just how the Academy likes it.
0.875 <|###|> Melissa Leo's Oscar-nominated performance as a mother not above illegal business, but resolutely clinging to honesty and not giving into hypocrisy, is terrific. Hope comes from hard sacrifice in a finale proving sometimes possessions are our blessings.
0.8 <|###|> Actress Melissa Leo rightly earned an Oscar nomination for her part in this downbeat drama.
0.8 <|###|> Frozen River is a taut, suspenseful thriller; a troubling of borders both cultural and national; and testament to the virtues of communion, empathy and compassion.
0.8 <|###|> Original, sad, suspenseful and involving: the kind of work that helps independent American cinema retain its good name.
0.8 <|###|> Occasionally marred by contrivance and a crude internal logic that doesn't bear close scrutiny, 'Frozen River' works best as a knuckle-gnawing, blue-collar genre thriller.
0.8 <|###|> Leo and Upham give performances of great conviction and the film is bold and uncliched: especially the matter-of-fact treatment of guns.
0.6 <|###|> It's Leo, with her pained and battered magnetism - half-pleading, half screw-you - who shakes the film out of its occasional glibness, notching up the performance of her career in thrilling, hungry style.
0.8 <|###|> Everything about the film looks and feels authentic, from the desolate landscape dotted with trailers and fast-food joints to the people who populate a borderland that offers none of them much hope.
0.8 <|###|> A fascinating, understated look at the human condition.
0.8 <|###|> Cold yet never calculating, it's a fine film featuring a heart-rendingly knockout performance of steel and strength from Leo.
0.8 <|###|> Leo and Upham make an unlikely double act in a finely written, well-played film with a striking plot and setting. Hunt's clearly a name to watch; Leo, meanwhile, can look forward to finally getting the recognition, and roles, she deserves.
0.6 <|###|> As a quiet celebration of ordinary women's resourcefulness, the film is well-crafted, sensitively acted and modestly affecting.
0.6 <|###|> While there is much to admire, there is little to enjoy as downtrodden folk try to make money the hard way. At heart it is a sentimental drama that rarely connects.
0.8 <|###|> Frozen River will penetrate your core like a biting Arctic wind.
0.8 <|###|> A modest but thrilling drama.
0.8 <|###|> Frozen River represents one of the best examples of the new trend for austerity and social realism in American indie cinema.
0.8 <|###|> The surprising twists and turns in the final act are both powerful and haunting.
0.8 <|###|> This is that rarest of beasts - an indie thriller that tries to win over viewers not with crowbarred-in whimsy but with a gripping plot and two brilliant lead characters.
0.6 <|###|> Frozen River is a quirky drama driven by a couple of outstanding performances.
1.0 <|###|> Frozen River is a superbly written, genuinely moving drama with an unmissable central performance from Melissa Leo. Highly recommended and one of the best films of the year.
0.8 <|###|> Skating between thriller and character/social drama, Hunt has created a women's movie with backbone, fleshed out by terrifically steely performances from Leo and Upham, who manage to convey the intricacy of the women's decisions despite the sparse dialogu
0.7 <|###|> It is more conventionally melodramatic than its realist postures might at first suggest, but in the end Frozen River is kept from sinking into icy oblivion by the brittle strength of its central performances.
0.8 <|###|> The film's strength lies in the utter realism and the lack of sentimentality with which the characters and situations are presented, but it runs the risk of being so uncompromising that potential audiences will avoid it, which would be a pity.
0.8 <|###|> Hunt's grip on the impulsive fumblings of real-life behaviour is so firm that you stay with her all the way, almost forgetting to breathe. It's a simple story but a primal one, and it gives Leo the role she's long deserved.
0.875 <|###|> ...Leo's character is fleshed-out to such an extent that one can't help but sympathize with her plight and root for her success.
0.5 <|###|> The points Hunt wants to make may not be profound (desperate people do desperate things; morality takes a backseat, but not forever), but Leo makes them seem fresh.
0.6 <|###|> Despite a few contrived plot turns and some heavy handed symbolism, this first feature from writer-director Courtney Hunt can be recommended as a thriller, as a tearjerker, and as a regional study.
0.8 <|###|> Ita(TM)s a film that trawls through race and disenfranchisement but ultimately ends up as a powerful portrait of women whose spirit is galvanised by their motherhood.
0.8 <|###|> Realistically depicts the relationship between the allure of criminal activity and times of desperation.
0.77 <|###|> While it's no crowd-pleaser, Frozen River is powerfully honest stripped-down filmmaking.
1.0 <|###|> A gritty, super-realistic, female empowerment flick most memorable for Melissa Leo's spellbinding, Oscar-nominated performance.
0.8 <|###|> Una muy buena historia sobre la supervivencia, solidamente narrada y excelentemente interpretada, sobre todo por la extraordinaria Melissa Leo.
0.75 <|###|> Holding Frozen River up to traditional standards of morality doesn't work.
0.7 <|###|> One of those worthy movies that is a lot easier to admire than like.
0.75 <|###|> You couldn't call it a happy movie, but it's an absorbing one.
0.6 <|###|> Offers a wacky portrait of the sexual foibles of men.
0.625 <|###|> The acting is excellent and the bickering is the best. ... Director Iris Green and the terrific cast leave us with a lot of promise for future films.
0.6 <|###|> Really quite fun. Up to a point.
0.6 <|###|> The plot may sound fairly simplistic but underneath the blood and guts there's a biting satire about rich cosseted students signing up to causes they hardly understand.
0.625 <|###|> The Green Inferno receives a palpable shot in the arm from the characters' initial arrival into the tribe's primitive camp...
0.75 <|###|> A fun and interesting twist on the travelogue sub-genre of horror ... far better than many horror movies with twice the budget.
0.7 <|###|> A very slow start threatens to derail The Green Inferno, but once the terror begins, it never lets up and Roth once again proves why he's a master of horror.
0.7 <|###|> if you want an absolutely brutal experience that's tough to endure, just like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, this is probably the movie for you.
0.8 <|###|> Words on the screen, their power to free you, and also entrap you - if this isn't the internet's deadly blessing, what is?
0.6 <|###|> Having recently released documentaries on clerical abuse, Mario Cuomo, Park Avenue, Lance Armstrong and, now, WikiLeaks, Gibney seems in danger of becoming an actualite machine.
0.8 <|###|> Outstanding, cool-headed documentary.
0.8 <|###|> A breathless, dazzling and mind-blowingly complex 130-minute story.
0.8 <|###|> I'd have liked to know more about his private life and background but Gibney has too much other ground to cover.
0.8 <|###|> We Steal Secrets is much concerned with conspiracy theories and may well wind up fuelling new ones.
0.6 <|###|> A thorough and decently intentioned work, though it accepts a little too glibly the more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger line against Assange: that he is a fascinating radical who simply became a paranoid authoritarian.
0.7 <|###|> With a subject matter that oddly feels both timely and out-of-date, this documentary is packed with telling details about WikiLeaks, Although it gets muddy as it delves into the lives of founder Julian Assange and whistleblower Bradley Manning.
0.8 <|###|> This is saying something important. Check your Facebook settings.
0.8 <|###|> This is an expertly organised documentary; Gibney's always are.
0.8 <|###|> In truth, there's little in Alex Gibney's film that won't be familiar to attentive news watchers, but this skilled documentarian has mastered the art of condensing a vast and complex amount of information into a gripping and entertaining package.
0.8 <|###|> This thorough, engrossing film shows how idealistic Aussie hacker Julian Assange took on the might of the US, exposing their military and diplomatic misconduct, then allowed his own murky personal life to tarnish his credibility.
0.8 <|###|> The range of Gibney's subjects, the rigour of his research and the complexity of his questions make We Steal Secrets breathlessly compelling, but it's the moments of psychological probing that haunt the most.
0.8 <|###|> Noxious government activities may warrant exposure, but Gibney points out that the whistleblowers can be pretty flawed too.
0.8 <|###|> Alex Gibney adds to his forensic examinations of Enron and Abu Ghraib with another fine documentary.
0.8 <|###|> A thoughtful documentary about Julian Assange, Bradley Manning, secrets, lies, power and the poorly understood nature of the internet.
0.9 <|###|> If you're looking for a really comprehensive, clear, evenhanded and thoroughly entertaining examination of, well, the story of WikiLeaks, master documentarian Alex Gibney has gone to the trouble of providing you with one.
0.8 <|###|> A fascinating insight into Wikileaks and the two men behind the world's largest ever whistleblowing scandal.
0.8 <|###|> This look at WikiLeaks -- and founder Julian Assange -- makes its case long before the film stops talking.
0.8 <|###|> It portrays a seething nest of highly volatile personalities whose motivations are fraught with ambiguities and contradictions, and a chain of actions and reactions the full impact of which has yet to be measured.
0.8 <|###|> Alex Gibney's film is an absorbing examination of the world's most infamous information portal.
0.75 <|###|> Which is the real Assange? This movie cannot say. It's as if Gibney threw up his hands, put the whole mess in the audience's lap and said, "Here, YOU figure this guy out."
0.875 <|###|> Sometimes it takes a feature-length documentary to stitch together a story we think we already know.
0.875 <|###|> Smart and opinionated, it's a great introduction to this ongoing story.
0.875 <|###|> A real-life cyber-thriller with real-life consequences, Alex Gibney's We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks is a riveting and revelatory documentary ...
0.875 <|###|> Gibney builds a remarkable level of suspense, given how exhaustively WikiLeaks has been covered in the media.
1.0 <|###|> Engaging, kinetic, revelatory and unexpected.
0.8 <|###|> At once an awkward mingling of two complex life stories and a gripping, necessary look at how information is gathered, shared and, yes, stolen.
0.875 <|###|> Who is "We" in the title We Steal Secrets? There's no need for a spoiler alert, but it's neither Gibney nor Assange.
0.75 <|###|> Despite its wonky-Washington theme, We Steal Secrets ends up being a surprisingly soulful and, yes, even moving story of hubris, good intentions and mistakes.
0.72 <|###|> The film is fascinating and provocative, deftly navigating complex personalities and shifting allegiances.
0.875 <|###|> The movie's especially deft at exposing spin, whether it's the US media's or Assange's.
0.75 <|###|> A fascinating account of a man who loved stirring the pot until he was the one sitting in it.
0.8 <|###|> Gibney has created one of the signature discussions on the signature debate of the post-9/11 information-security age, namely: Who needs to know?
0.5751000000000001 <|###|> It doesn't offer any new or surprising information or any profound analysis, so it barely scratches the multifaceted surface of Assange and remains slightly undercooked.
0.75 <|###|> A throwback action movie that invokes 1980s nostalgia in all the right ways.
0.8 <|###|> The Last Stand is a fast-paced, action-heavy throwback, shot with a fluid visual eye by Kim Jee-Woon. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back and better than ever.
0.5 <|###|> As action movies go, it's okay. There are some good ideas underneath and an attempt develop them, but only an attempt. And though time has moved on, Schwarzenegger himself hasn't. As a hero's triumphal return goes, it's more of a whimper.
0.6 <|###|> Arnie lurches through the film with a kind of defiant dignity, his signature mixture of self-effacing humour and good ol' tough talk allowing us to buy into the kind of big-screen hero he made us fall in love with all those decades ago.
0.6 <|###|> Director Jee-woon Kim (I Saw the Devil) knows how to fill up the screen, surround his megastar with economy-sized murders, car chases, billowing blood-clouds and goofiness.
0.6 <|###|> The film, though underdeveloped, is rife with big guns, flippant one-liners, improbable battles, high-octane car chases and way too much testosterone - all the hallmarks of a classic Schwarzenegger film.
0.6 <|###|> ...it's refreshing to watch a film that wants to be nothing more than a blood-soaked accompaniment to beer and pizza.
0.2 <|###|> The gimmick of Schwarzenegger's return to cinema wears off quickly. A bland bullet riddled excuse for an action flick.
0.6 <|###|> The Last Stand sees bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger return to the big screen following an eight-year term as Governor of California, because that is the reality we now occupy... A fun, dumb, enjoyable, dumb, mostly well performed, super dumb film.
0.5 <|###|> Mindless, dumb fun as Arnie grunts a few one liners and tries to terminate an escaped drug lord who's in a fast car and heading for freedom.
0.7 <|###|> Despite some graphic violence and even though it is really silly, this is an entertaining action film showing that Arnold Schwartzenegger has not lost any of his charm.
0.5 <|###|> Surely the former governor of the state could have come across a better script for his return to the big screen in a starring role.
0.75 <|###|> No, he doesn't demonstrate a lot of 'Terminator'-style moves.But, hey, he doesn't have to. Schwarzenegger, now in his mid-60s, just needs to tote some weapons, seek revenge and utter a few one-liners, which is exactly what he does in 'The Last Stand.'
0.4 <|###|> Arnie stomps his way through a role in which every punch looks clumsy and every line of dialogue sounds like it has been learnt phonetically.
0.8 <|###|> "The Last Stand" could be an old episode of "Gunsmoke," with its theme of the law versus the bad guys.
0.625 <|###|> An entertaining, if not particularly longed for, return for the 65-year-old action icon.
0.6 <|###|> The results are surprisingly good fun, popcorn-friendly, and awfully redolent of Rio Bravo. Fine by us. He's back, alright.
0.5 <|###|> Korean filmmaker Kim played with the Western genre before in his wacky 2008 pastiche The Good the Bad the Weird, and this film is just as chaotically uneven, mixing cartoon-style silliness with grisly violence.
0.625 <|###|> There isn't much of a story here, though it's great to see Arnold back where he belongs.
0.625 <|###|> Satisfied customers may include undiscriminating action fans, Luis Guzman completists and Wayne LaPierre (one bad guy meets his reward when he trespasses on the property of a shotgun-toting granny).
0.6 <|###|> As comebacks go, Schwarzenegger has chosen a really good vehicle with which to remind people of how he became so popular in the first place.
0.6 <|###|> If slick nostalgia is what you're after, The Last Stand is for you.
0.6 <|###|> It's entertaining, if a little (a lot) silly.
0.6 <|###|> It's good to see Arnie moving back to the kind of public service he does best.
0.6 <|###|> An action star is (re)born.
0.6 <|###|> A suitably lightweight comeback for Arnie, The Last Stand does just enough to please his legion of fans, and proves the action icon still has charisma to spare.
0.6 <|###|> Korean film-maker Kim Jee-woon gives it plenty of directorial welly, and it's good to see a film with cop cars flying through the air.
0.6 <|###|> Arnold is back as an action hero, and playing someone near his own age. Therefore the movie is more believable and thus more entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> A zippier, zestier film than ... its own hackneyed premise suggests.
0.4 <|###|> A creaky, lethargic and daft action thriller ...
0.6 <|###|> Many things are blown up, in some style.
0.8 <|###|> Entertaining, pleasingly old-school Arnie action thriller, enlivened by stylish direction, strong performances and some nice ideas.
0.45 <|###|> Cool to see Arnold back. I just wish the movie was a little better.
0.4 <|###|> Where the film could have been self-aware and a little cleverer for it, director Jee-woon Kim misses a trick by sticking to the action formula.
0.625 <|###|> That Second Amendment sure kicks ass.
0.4 <|###|> This movie has confirmed my suspicion that people need to leave Hunter S. Thompson's story alone for a while.
0.77 <|###|> Gonzo's brilliance is in showing Thompson warts and all, without taking anything away from his greatness even as it shows his many deficiencies.
0.9 <|###|> Alex Gibney's documentary about bad boy journalist Dr. Hunter S. Thompson is both a memorial exaltation and a lament. Gibney's masterful style balances verite and dramatic effect. He doesn't doesn't tell you what to think, but spurs you to think.
0.8 <|###|> A definitive, accessible, even inspiring screen biography put together with thought and vitality.
0.6666666666666666 <|###|> The film's plea that we need Thompson now more than ever is a little misty-eyed: Thompson's day was long gone by the time he put a gun to his head.
0.9 <|###|> Much like the man himself, it's quite a piece of work.
0.8 <|###|> Gonzo is much more than a tribute to a maverick and genuine pioneer. It's a lament for the gaping hole that Thompson left behind. The only obvious weakness is Gibney's reluctance to engage fully with Thompson's toxic personal life.
0.6 <|###|> This documentary about his life by Alex Gibney, though entertaining in many ways, is oddly uninterested in his strengths or otherwise as a writer, the very gift for which Thompson earnestly wished to be known.
0.6 <|###|> Director Alex Gibney has plundered 200 hours of audiotapes, hundreds of photos and personal testimony from an impressive roster of Thompson's colleagues and family to put together an even-handed portrait.
0.6 <|###|> A straight-line journey through the good doctor's loopy myth and madness, but one that doesn't push far enough into uncharted territory. Fine as a primer, but Gibney leans more towards admiration than examination.
0.6 <|###|> The film is content to laugh affectionately at Thompson's bad boy exploits, giggle at the impatience of a man who went hunting boar with a sub machine-gun.
0.4 <|###|> This soft-headed hagiography is a disappointment, and at least half an hour too long.
0.8 <|###|> Gibney says the film took so much out of him that he limped into the Sundance Festival with a ruptured disc, a green liver and spots in his eyes that will not disappear. I hope he now thinks it worth the trouble. I'm pretty sure watchers will.
0.8 <|###|> Superbly directed, hugely entertaining documentary that's a treat for both newcomers and aficionados of Thompson's work.
0.9 <|###|> With a wealth of archive material, documentary filmmaker Gibney assembles a remarkably astute and comprehensive look at the life of one of the most notorious journalists in American history.
0.8 <|###|> a seminal work of talking head biography
0.8 <|###|> Gonzo is an excellent reminder that Thompson was more than just a wild man. He was, at least for a time, a first-rate writer who covered his times and helped shape them.
0.6 <|###|> [Gibney] is never quite able to get beyond the familiar in order to give viewers a new and penetrating look at the subject of Thompson and his work.
0.5 <|###|> Too much time in this overly long film is spent on minutiae.
0.875 <|###|> The rare documentary that puts you in a headlock to pin you to your seat, Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson is a bracing masterpiece.
0.8 <|###|> Gibney thus has to negotiate a treacherous path. Its easy to romanticize a larger-than-life personality like Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, gonzo journalist, and it makes for compelling viewing. However, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, gonzo journalist, was not exactly
0.6 <|###|> The movie is full of itself and fun but nonessential.
0.6 <|###|> I wanted more unearthed footage. But if you are looking for a tribute to the man, you won't find anything better.
1.0 <|###|> Filmmaker Alex Gibney had access to those who knew the guy, the famous, the infamous and the obscure, and he paints a picture of a serious journalist who saw himself documenting 'the death of the American Dream.'
0.75 <|###|> As informative as parts of it are, the movie is not nearly as colorful as longtime Aspen, Colo., resident Thompson.
0.75 <|###|> In the manner of such key Thompson works as 'Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72,' the movie links entertaining personal biography with fascinating cultural history...
0.85 <|###|> As a diverting documentary, Gonzo lives up to its subject matter - it is indulgent and witty, filled with a thousand little insights and ultimately sad. Thompson seemed obscure to his family, cartoonishly overblown to his friends.
0.75 <|###|> Far more insightful than typical rose-colored-glasses eulogizing, the subjects are as brutally honest about Thompson's successes and shortcomings as Thompson was as a writer.
0.6 <|###|> Gonzo director Gibney frees himself from the heady topicality of his recent documentaries...and dives right down into the deep -- and dark -- end.
0.625 <|###|> [Director] Gibney assembles a wealth of Thompson memorabilia and first-person interviews for this often insightful and sometimes overly indulgent chronicle.
0.8 <|###|> Reading his books will give you better insight, but it's hard to imagine a better primer into Thompson's outlaw life.
0.625 <|###|> I was curious to see why we needed a two-hour documentary about the three-hit wonder who cast away his career halfway through life and coasted on celebrity status for 30 years. After seeing Gonzo, I'm still not convinced we do.
0.75 <|###|> An amused and affectionate look at the writer who formed a crucial link between the New Journalism of the 1960s and today's blogosphere.
0.625 <|###|> At its worst, the film takes a long detour into Thompson's admiration for an utterly banal 1974 Carter speech (The Powerful were sticking it to The People again) as a way to make us feel virtuous, political and leftish.
0.75 <|###|> Thompson created a rebellious niche for himself in a business that more often than you might think channels its writers into conformist routine.
0.7 <|###|> It's nice to be reminded, as Shakespeare taught us, that truth comes from the most unexpected places, even the booze-ree
0.5 <|###|> If you really want to understand and appreciate [Thompson], you'd be better off reading his books.
0.75 <|###|> Neatly balancing full-hearted celebration with evenhanded examination.
0.6 <|###|> This has its moments - what Scorsese film does not? -- but over a two-and-a-half-hour stretch it huffs and puffs and still doesn't blow the house down.
0.875 <|###|> There's a lot of tough talk from tough men in this testosterone-fueled thriller, as the thin blue line disintegrates amid gritty give-and-take in William Monahan's excellent script.
0.9 <|###|> The Departed is a near-perfect synthesis of cinematic genius and commercial appeal, quite possibly the most accomplished and accessible film from one of the greatest living directors.
0.8 <|###|> Bloody, brutal and brilliant -- DiCaprio and Nicholson shine in the crime movie of 2006.
0.9 <|###|> The shocking violence is well-placed. The action scenes are always comprehensible -- no jump cut cheats here -- and the suspense will make you fidget in your seat. What a corker.
1.0 <|###|> The best of its kind since Michael Mann's Heat.
0.8 <|###|> This is rich and satisfying stuff with Scorsese rediscovering his masterful skill at delivering a narrative which crackles with acid dialogue delivered by a gifted cast.
0.6 <|###|> As ingenious as it is artificial.
0.8 <|###|> Nicholson's unsavoury grin and seedy menace are a joy to behold.
1.0 <|###|> Rude, profane, clever, hilarious, engrossing, crowd-pleasing, ridiculously entertaining.
0.8 <|###|> As cop thrillers go, this is the best in quite a while.
0.5 <|###|> I think GoodFellas leaves this for dead, absolutely for dead.
1.0 <|###|> The Departed is not for the faint of heart. But scaredy-cats are going to miss a tremendously satisfying film, one that will have you leaving the theater saying, "Now, that was a movie."
0.8 <|###|> It all makes for extremely watchable entertainment.
0.8 <|###|> This is Scorsese's Serpico, his French Connection, his Heat, and he brings the same eye for anthropological detail to the boys in blue as he does to his beloved wiseguys.
0.8 <|###|> Scorsese finds himself back in his comfort zone with a crime epic about loyalty and deception that's deeply engaging and viciously entertaining from start to bloody finish.
0.9 <|###|> Urban film making at its best, The Departed is a brutally violent, beautifully crafted, and incredibly well acted piece of film making that will leave you reeling.
0.59 <|###|> The film is superbly shot, and the rapid-fire editing and shaky camera fit the constant flux that the main characters find themselves in time and again.
0.6 <|###|> Much splat, little art
0.75 <|###|> Scorsese isn't about plots; he's about people, places, and times, and until he departs from that, this film is a return to genius.
0.8 <|###|> One of the year's very best and most exciting films.
0.9 <|###|> The Departed heralds Martin Scorsese's return to the top of his game and simultaneously secures for the film a place in the pantheon of the very best of American crime cinema. Welcome back to Scorsese's mean streets.
0.4 <|###|> Scorsese revisits old territory in The Departed, and he doesn't do anything he hasn't done brilliantly several times before.
0.875 <|###|> Probably the director's most taut piece of storytelling since Goodfellas.
1.0 <|###|> What makes this a Scorsese film, and not merely a retread, is the director's use of actors, locations and energy, and its buried theme. I am fond of saying that a movie is not about what it's about; it's about how it's about it.
0.875 <|###|> Lukas Moodyson's debut feature has a grainy, immediate feel that nicely enhances the story's emotional honesty -- a quality that our own popular teen movies have only just begun to embrace.
0.8 <|###|> Nobody can deny the honesty or the outright sincerity this film has.
0.75 <|###|> Dahlstrom and especially Liljeberg are first-rate.
0.875 <|###|> Unfortunately, as the plot develops, it shies away from exploring that discontent, in favor of demonstrating precisely the kind of naivete and sweetness that one would expect to find in any teen romance.
0.875 <|###|> It's just an incredibly insightful character drama about true, awkward, beautiful first love, and it's all the better for it. Oh, and that last shot is as cute as it gets.
0.75 <|###|> High school, small town, teenagers in hormone hell -- or is that heaven?
0.9 <|###|> A completely charming reality-based romantic fantasy, both sweet-natured and sympathetic.
0.75 <|###|> The movie is funny, gentle, and true.
0.5 <|###|> The film has some charm and a winning simplicity but not an iota of depth.
0.5 <|###|> I'm tired of teens talking about make-up and making out. A lesbian twist to an otherwise standard story just isn't enough to make it compelling.
0.75 <|###|> Successfully captures the frenzied angst and boredom of youth, as well as the powerful, unbridled emotions of first love.
0.8 <|###|> A poignant exploration of the cruelty and anguish of teenage existence.
1.0 <|###|> Right away this film grabs attention with documentary-style close- ups and upends teen movie cliches.
0.8 <|###|> Incredibly fun, incredibly entertaining, and worth watching in all respects.
0.8 <|###|> A breath of fresh air in a genre too often controlled by Hollywood teen-pap.
0.875 <|###|> One of the most honest and heartfelt teen dramas ever to grace the screen.
0.87 <|###|> Dreyer goes to the Christian heart of the matter in this film. Damned powerful.
1.0 <|###|> Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1943 parable about witch-finding and witch-burning in 17th-century Denmark is coldly brilliant.
1.0 <|###|> A compelling family melodrama and a sombre exploration of how men co-opt religious dogma to oppress and punish female desires.
1.0 <|###|> Day of Wrath is probably the simplest of the Dreyer films that I've seen, but it is still a great work.
1.0 <|###|> Dreyer was a master of conveying emotion in a way that can only be called "literary"
1.0 <|###|> A study of good and evil, repression and oppression, sexuality and guilt, Day of Wrath is a truly spiritual film.
0.75 <|###|> Director To doesn't sacrifice substance to style. The over-the-top violent flourishes, more psychological than paint-the-screen-red literal, will burrow under your skin.
0.6 <|###|> Whatever he lacks in narrative drive, To is still the master of style.
0.8 <|###|> The exposition is perfectly balanced with bloody action and muscular set-pieces.
0.875 <|###|> The film's violence erupts in rare, staccato bursts, all the more horrifying for coming out of nowhere.
0.6 <|###|> If it is too stylistically modest to win converts among the multiplex crowd, the film surely rewards followers of the genre.
0.875 <|###|> If Machiavelli's The Prince and Sun Tzu's The Art of War translate to other centuries and cultures, so might Election and Triad Election.
0.75 <|###|> [Director To's] talent for documentary-style realism and navigating complex political systems sets him apart, though his nationalism puts him squarely in the mainstream.
0.5 <|###|> The moviea(TM)s most powerful component is political.
0.75 <|###|> This remains a well-crafted genre movie, and one that promises further developments in its final scene.
0.625 <|###|> Like the late John Frankenheimer, director To marries his drama with action and superb composition to achieve compelling results at times.
0.875 <|###|> Into a season of Hollywood blockbusters, this import arrives with the impact of a high-velocity bullet.
0.8 <|###|> Like any good sequel, this film takes what is familiar with the original's concept -- in this case, an internecine struggle for supremacy -- and deepens it.
0.625 <|###|> Triad Election is slow-burning and sedate, even dull in stretches. But it deserves credit for presenting such a courageous critique of the Chinese system, which combines the worst aspects of official corruption and mob lawlessness.
0.625 <|###|> Like many Hong Kong mob movies, Triad Election</i is not about fleshed-out characters or intricate stories. It's a blunt, grimly efficient action movie that underlines the lies gangsters tell themselves so they, at least, can believe they're good guys.
0.875 <|###|> Johnny To's superb, graceful new Triad Election actually has quite a bit in common with Francis Coppola's Godfather trilogy.
0.8333333333333334 <|###|> The director rejuvenates the genre by connecting the dots between a criminal subculture and a much bigger sociological picture. He's finally given HK cinema its very own Godfather.
0.75 <|###|> Two screenwriters were responsible for this fascinating look at organized crime in China, as well as the continuing governmental policies that make the triads thrive.
0.875 <|###|> Comparisons to The Godfather Part II are inevitable. For a change, such comparisons are also favorable.
0.8 <|###|> Guided by To's elegant camera moves, less visceral than most Hong Kong filmmakers, the Election movies put a fresh, intriguing spin on the usual cinematic gangster motifs.
0.75 <|###|> Ready for The Godfather with a distinctly Hong Kong flavor?
0.75 <|###|> Plenty of films owe a debt to The Godfather, but it's rare to see inspiration used as successfully as it is here.
0.8 <|###|> expertly captures the battle between old-school gangster pathology and the new cutthroat tactics of the corporate criminal
0.75 <|###|> The parallels to all three Godfather films are there, if you care to look, but the Election films have other pleasures.
0.9 <|###|> The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller Triad Election as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier.
1.0 <|###|> Maybe you don't know much about this director. But if you like Hong Kong action movies where everyone's constantly killing each other in a ballet of bullets (and other weapons), then [Johnny To] is your new Francis Ford Coppola.
0.875 <|###|> This disturbing social order, both inside and outside the Triad, is the series' defining characteristic. Because of its emphasis, this installment satisfies, even if another sequel feels inevitable.
0.625 <|###|> Election 2 is equal in precision to its predecessor, exuding a perpetual sense of danger.
0.625 <|###|> The bar has been set so low in mainstream Hollywood movies that it's not even worth seriously analyzing this stuff
0.625 <|###|> This one had the most potential, and in that way it is the most disappointing.
0.75 <|###|> A fitting capstone on a collection of screen classics for the ages!
0.625 <|###|> The only one of the trilogy that actually works as both a good Summer movie and a solid sci-fi movie in its own right.
0.7 <|###|> full review in Greek
0.8 <|###|> For me, Sith succeeds in providing a satisfying ending to the films while also closing a chapter of my own life.
0.8 <|###|> It did what I thought was impossible after the previous two films: it made me a Star Wars fan again.
1.0 <|###|> A great Star Wars film and, dare I say, a great film onto itself.
0.4 <|###|> As blockbusters go, Revenge of the Sith has some good throwaway entertainment, but there have been better blockbusters with better throwaway entertainment.
0.625 <|###|> The best thing about Episode III? Jar Jar Binks is barely in it.
0.5 <|###|> Although the stiff theatrics are part of the design, they're no longer excusable.
0.8 <|###|> What makes this movie work is watching Anakin Skywalker break our hearts, and ultimately serve as a textbook example of how the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
0.9 <|###|> In years to come George Lucas's farewell to his STAR WARS series may be considered his finest entry.
0.75 <|###|> Against all odds, the movie becomes more than the sum of its creaky parts, building enough emotional firepower to destroy an entire hard-bitten cynic such as myself.
0.8 <|###|> This is the film we yearned for as we sat passively through the shoddy merchandise-oriented Phantom Menace and the dull romantic scenes of Attack of the Clones.
0.9 <|###|> For the 6th time in a row, George Lucas has done it again.
0.6 <|###|> Why are blinds wipes and Fisher-Price spaceship interiors employed in a 2005 film?
0.6 <|###|> Star Wars was a gamble in 1977. In 2005 Revenge of the Sith is the Empire.
0.8 <|###|> Prepare to be blown away because George Lucas&#146;'s latest space opera is an absolute belter, recalling the old magic of The Empire Strikes Back and banishing forever painful memories of the last two Star Wars prequels.
0.8 <|###|> Episode III hooks up to its sequel of 1977 as neatly as a space station landing dock.
0.6 <|###|> Veering from moments of breathtakingly visualized valor to outright stupidity, Sith is a vast improvement over the previous two outings, but still and all, it's no Star Wars.
0.8 <|###|> I am pleased to report that George Lucas has found his way back from the Dark Side.
0.75 <|###|> As popcorn entertainment, strapping in for Star Wars: Episode III is like hooking up with an old friend. Half the enjoyment is simply the idea of the reunion itself.
0.75 <|###|> As with the last two Star Wars movies, Revenge of the Sith is a visual spectacle, trotting out the best special effects Industrial Light and Magic has to offer.
0.875 <|###|> ...at once a work of closure and of sustenance.
0.8 <|###|> To Star Wars fans everywhere, a celebration of galactic proportions.
0.75 <|###|> ...the brilliant final showdown between Obi-Wan and Anakin for his soul is the moment that takes the Star Wars saga where it needs to go ...
0.7 <|###|> So boxed in by having to tie everything into a neat parcel that it feels constrained and is woefully lacking in surprises and dramatic tension.
0.6 <|###|> Spectacular ... but it never really lifts you up into a new imaginative realm -- it never takes you away. It just keeps blazing at you.
0.625 <|###|> It's not to say there's not a lot wrong with the film, but rather to suggest that the chief criticisms of it being strange and "a mess" aren't among them.
0.6 <|###|> An often fascinating mess, but a mess all the same.
0.25 <|###|> There's the obese Brando pretending to be God while dressed in gauzy white robes like a demented pope
0.8 <|###|> Amazingly, Kilmer delivers an odder performance than Brando. Creepy retelling.
0.5 <|###|> In its final third, the movie goes to hell in more ways than Frankenheimer intended.
0.625 <|###|> The most exciting characters are killed off too early, and what we're left with is a Satan's "Seasme Street."
0.2 <|###|> I'm sure it looked good on paper. That and Kilmer's frighteningly apt mimicry of Brando's voice are about the only positive things I can say.
0.5 <|###|> The movie keeps switching focus without ever getting its bearings, and when Brando exits earlier than expected, there's little but mayhem to fall back on.
0.8 <|###|> Uneven; definitely has its moments.
0.6 <|###|> If McKellar could have just injected some of the eccentricity of his brilliant debut, Last Night, into proceedings we might have had an Ealing-esque social farce. Instead we're left with a comedy that's wry but prosaic.
0.4 <|###|> At best, this aspires to the whimsical charm of Local Hero; at worst, it simply steals from it.
0.6 <|###|> This is all about duels between rugged veterans. Cheery Gleeson and craggy Gordon Pinset steal the show.
0.6 <|###|> Though ultimately a somewhat forgettable feature film, The Grand Seduction does have a lot of heart and a certain charm to it which makes for an easy, gratifying experience.
0.4 <|###|> The filmmakers hope for a fable-like charm rather than gritty credibility, but the whole thing feels as cynical as the villagers' convoluted mission.
0.4 <|###|> A comedy drama that offers a portrait of the Emerald Isle that is contrived in its quaintness.
0.4 <|###|> It's a bit of a soppy, sappy film that wastes Gleeson's talent and incidentally appears to imply that bribing oil-company executives is a victimless crime.
0.4 <|###|> Brendan Gleeson and Taylor Kitsch doggy-paddle awkwardly through this lacklustre fishing village comedy.
0.6 <|###|> Despite some occasional wobbles, this is a charming small-town comedy in the Ealing tradition, while Douglas Koch's attractive cinematography is almost enough to make you consider relocating to Newfoundland. Almost.
0.4 <|###|> Gleeson is a strong anchor and brings some complexity to his part; it's just that he isn't served well by a script that too often mistakes bluntness for irony.
0.4 <|###|> McKellar's take on class is a fib too far: low-grade laughs can't sweeten the sour message that any crap job will placate working folks. Think: Local Zero.
0.7 <|###|> A snug film about community and the torture of men out of work. There's a warmth to it, a likeability that doesn't wear off. Gleeson's big grizzly bear persona is a big reason why.
0.8 <|###|> Offers familiar pleasures of no little charm. Sometimes that's enough. When the star is Brendan Gleeson, it may be more than enough.
0.75 <|###|> Warmhearted and, thanks to Gleeson, laugh-out-loud funny.
0.4 <|###|> As harmless pablum, The Grand Seduction is mildly arousing, just don't expect it to follow through.
0.6 <|###|> Charming comedy, filled with breezy Irish blarney.
0.7 <|###|> Thanks to its cast, "The Grand Seduction" turns out to be, if not exactly groundbreaking, at least agreeable, comfortable fun.
1.0 <|###|> A delightful cinematic gem.
0.5 <|###|> Loved Local Hero? Charmed by Waking Ned Devine? Then go watch Local Hero and Waking Ned Devine.
0.6 <|###|> Even if it feels a bit formulaic, it's a formula that works.
0.875 <|###|> So intricately plotted and unlikely that it verges on the exotic, "The Grand Seduction" is nevertheless a hoot.
0.625 <|###|> A fish-out-of-water fable set within a fabulously scenic backdrop, against which wholesome humor and a thoroughgoing humanist streak play out and intertwine with gentle, unforced ease.
0.625 <|###|> The more this predictable, faux-endearing Canadian comedy works at being irresistible, the harder it is to enjoy.
0.2 <|###|> The end result is like tea with too much sugar and cream: pleasant enough, but so mild that you start to miss the bitter and the bite.
0.375 <|###|> The attempt at lighthearted sweetness is just like the townspeople's imitation of cricket: They're playing, but they really don't know how.
0.625 <|###|> An over-familiar formula, but a winning cast
0.5 <|###|> The original, it's ultimately clear, is a much, much more accomplished piece of work.
0.75 <|###|> It's graceful and sweet and wise where it counts, and often brilliantly acted, and it made me laugh.
0.4 <|###|> The Grand Seduction seems more bent on following the recipe than developing any actual characters or connections.
0.6 <|###|> Director Don McKellar fills the harbour with some great worn faces, including a lovely turn by Gordon Pinsent as Simon, a town elder whose blue eyes practically twinkle with both drunken complicity and sober reservation.
0.8 <|###|> The Grand Seduction is a thoroughly modern film that resembles nothing less than classic Hollywood comedies like Local Hero and Waking Ned Devine in both its comedy and its real, rich characters.
0.625 <|###|> By and large, the film's folksiness bucks schmaltz.
0.6 <|###|> While it doesn't reinvent the wheel, or the film from which it takes nearly all its ideas, The Grand Seduction emerges as an all too rare specimen: a charming, heartfelt, crowd-pleasing Canadian comedy.
0.6 <|###|> With just a couple of strong casting choices and a winsome tone, an old formula can still work, and The Grand Seduction comes out of the lab with a disarming readiness to please.
0.6 <|###|> Gleeson and the collection of good-natured seniors with accents will win your heart.
0.2 <|###|> Things are so cheap they didn't even spring for uniforms for the so-called cops; everybody seems to be wearing their street clothes.
0.75 <|###|> The unusually subtle yet eloquent debut of Israeli director Haim Tabakman...
0.75 <|###|> The movie respects the Jewish tradition of inquiry and debate; it unreels as a sort of dramatic dialogue that acknowledges the benefits and terrors of both religious fundamentalism and personal freedom.
0.6 <|###|> This restrained piece from first-time Israeli film-maker Haim Tabakman explores the tension between faith and sexuality in Jerusalem.
0.6 <|###|> The simplicity of the tale is its strength and the acting of Zohar Strauss as Aaron and Ran Danker as Ezri is entirely natural.
0.9 <|###|> It's almost impossible to imagine anyone making a gay romance between two orthodox Jews. And yet this film is subtle and sensitive, and full of earthy honesty as it explores a seriously difficult situation.
0.75 <|###|> A sensitively directed and movingly acted story of forbidden love.
0.8 <|###|> A very human story quietly unfolds with a compelling understatement in this dour but deeply-felt drama from director Haim Tabakman.
0.6 <|###|> This is responsible, restrained and intelligent, but if anything, the risky subject material is handled with too much caution.
0.2 <|###|> Director Haim Tabakman avoids sensationalism so assiduously that his film has slightly less eroticism than the average party political broadcast.
0.8 <|###|> It's not just the subject matter of impossible love that recalls Brokeback Mountain, but the same aching sadness and pathos.
1.0 <|###|> One of the best and most moving love stories you'll ever see. Absolutely top draw.
0.6 <|###|> Tabakman makes evocative use of enclosed spaces and silences, and tempers the melodrama with a sociological authenticity that confirms the centrality of belief in Jewish culture.
0.8 <|###|> Slow and often silent, it's an extraordinarily disciplined film that respects, if not honours, the milieu of its story...
0.4 <|###|> Worthy in theme, honourable in intent, oddly bloodless in execution.
0.6 <|###|> Director Haim Tabakman conjures up the sad mood very skilfully, with natural lighting, measured pace and an unexpected electronic soundtrack. In fact, it's probably my favourite film about the romantic love between two Jewish guys since Superbad.
0.6 <|###|> The film's urgent point about the need for understanding is made with dignity and an appreciable tinge of sorrow.
0.6 <|###|> Impressively directed, thought-provoking and emotionally engaging drama that plays like an orthodox Jewish version of Brokeback Mountain, though the pacing and minimalistic dialogue might prove too arthouse for some tastes.
0.875 <|###|> As oblique and laconic as its characters, Tabakman's moral tale rises to a melancholy spirituality.
0.9 <|###|> "Brokeback Mezuzah": Tender, affecting, brave, and beautifully wrought,
0.825 <|###|> Brave, provocative and gently engrossing with well-nuanced performances.
0.9 <|###|> It moves slowly and patiently through the ordeal of a single soul, illuminating in the process a cosmos of intense and hidden feeling.
0.625 <|###|> Quiet, sober and tense, the movie makes some interesting points, but it lacks the emotional firepower of Brokeback Mountain.
0.6 <|###|> The drama's moments of inspiration vindicate its desultory proceedings.
0.6 <|###|> Haim Tabakman's feature directing debut fascinates for the powerful, multi-layered themes that percolate beneath its visually spare and delicately told story.
0.8 <|###|> Unusually sensitive look into the hearts of nonconformists in an extremely conforming community as the different risks they take and the choices they make are quite moving.
0.6 <|###|> Bellocchio famously took on the Catholic Church and the Italian family in his frenetic first film ... Now 40 years later, Bellocchio's attack on the same institutions is calmer and more temperate.
0.75 <|###|> Enigmatic and mesmerizing.
0.75 <|###|> An artful look at religious hypocrisy, interfamily dynamics and the way people wrestle with personal history long after the original events are over.
0.75 <|###|> It's a bit of a mess but strong stuff nevertheless.
0.75 <|###|> Exceptionally handsome, somber film.
0.5 <|###|> It's almost as if screenwriter/director Marco Bellocchio wants to exorcise personal demons rather than entertain.
0.625 <|###|> The quizzically abrupt ending leaves [too many] questions, and the viewer, hanging.
0.75 <|###|> It is a riveting, rich portrait of an atheist who thinks he's resistant to faith but may be in the throes of a feverish conversion.
0.8 <|###|> Bellocchio's complex drama is held together by the tight and focused performance of Castellitto.
0.6 <|###|> It's a sly, subtle portrait of systematic hypocrisy (try to count the number of times faith is referred to as an 'insurance policy') and the mysterious way fate binds children to their parents.
0.625 <|###|> An edgy drama unwinds with an emotional letdown.
1.0 <|###|> This superbly filmed Italian drama stands with Bellocchio's best work.
0.8 <|###|> Marco Bellocchio's expansive, memorable film floats and plummets like a box kite in a storm on drafts of melodrama, mysticism and humor.
0.6 <|###|> My Mother's Smile overflows with mildly interesting ideas and characters, but the end result is decidedly tepid.
0.6 <|###|> Flawed but fascinating portrait of Vatican politics.
0.625 <|###|> Bellocchio has a way of spelling everything out for the audience; nonetheless, the film's intellectualism is both provocative and remarkably playful.
1.0 <|###|> Nick Park is a genius. Enough said.
1.0 <|###|> A quest for cheese has never been more gutbustingly funny.
0.3 <|###|> Lessons about social responsibility are submerged in a bubble bath of innocent glamour; Amy Heckerling's Clueless looks like a mordant social satire by comparison.
0.4 <|###|> Even Anjelica Huston as a rival cosmetics magnate struggles to inject any venom into the proceedings.
0.3 <|###|> Welcome to adulthood, Hillary and Haylie Duff. Here are your T-Mobile Sidekicks and Tabloid news stories. Leave your personalities at the door.
0.4 <|###|> A brain-numbing, fluffy flick for tweens.
0.125 <|###|> An insipid mess not worthy of the tweens who flock to such flicks.
0.4 <|###|> Along the way, self-discovery bangs 'em over the head.
0.4 <|###|> The Duff sisters are pleasant personalities, but the vapid bimbosity of their characters quickly becomes grating.
0.2 <|###|> Forced to endure such casually offensive nonsense, the viewer ends up slumming it far more than the duff protagonists.
0.4 <|###|> Watchable enough and by no means as bad as The Perfect Man, although there's not much here that'll interest the over-12s.
0.2 <|###|> Messy, patronising and tonally confused, this vanity project - timed to co-incide with Hilary Duff's perfume launch - quite frankly stinks.
0.2 <|###|> "This thing is screwier than Courtney Love!" whimpers Hilary in her usual chihuahua-on-helium whine. Even she, however, manages to shine next to her aggravating older sister, saddled as she is with all the comic timing of a mortally wounded elephant.
0.2 <|###|> Haylie and sister Hilary Duff just don't have the comedy stylings to sell this half-baked story of heiress sisters battling to save their dad's cosmetics empire from ruin.
0.4 <|###|> seems more of an ode to Paris and Nicky Hilton than a decent vehicle for these sisters
0.2 <|###|> Frankly movies like Material Girls sicken me; they're base and soulless and entirely unworthy of the celluloid they were filmed upon.
0.0 <|###|> The villain (a greedy corporate man of some sort) isn't very fleshed out, but it's hard to believe that he's any worse than the two self-serving, appearance-obsessed protagonists, with whom the film asks young girls everywhere to identify.
0.5 <|###|> Martha Coolidge's direction treats the whole adventure with more respect than it deserves, which also makes one wish that she'd been able to work with the Duffs on something much more worthwhile.
0.375 <|###|> As if one Duff wasn't enough for us.
0.25 <|###|> I liked it better with Brittany Murphy.
0.2 <|###|> The fact is, neither Hilary nor Haylie have any flair for subtle comedy.
0.0 <|###|> It's sort of reassuring that although Madge has seemingly given up starring in bad movies, her company is still financing terrible scripts.
0.0 <|###|> The movie, which was not screened for critics, makes a joke of everyone who isn't wealthy, white and pencil thin.
0.0 <|###|> The scariest part of Material Girls comes when you're sitting in the dark theater and start considering the possibility that young women might find these characters sympathetic.
0.4 <|###|> finally drives a Duff vehicle into the land of beguilingly awful.
0.125 <|###|> You might remember it from May when it starred Lindsay Lohan and was called Just My Luck.
0.32 <|###|> This is indeed one dumb film.
0.25 <|###|> Stays true to its name, all right, but there's no reason the film also had to be an embarrassingly unfunny and aimless chore to sit through.
0.375 <|###|> A superficial tween comedy that mocks celebutantes like the Olsen twins while simultaneously pushing stars Hilary and Haylie Duff as their replacements.
0.5 <|###|> Light but listless.
0.625 <|###|> There is no edge to the movie at all, and that blandness will render it forgettable to anyone over the age of 12 or so, but for all that, it is pleasant enough, and occasionally even fun.
0.0 <|###|> Madonna's anthem was only good-naturedly arrogant, but the SoCal twins, like the film's script, are arrogant, ghastly immature and offensive to any audience that isn't all of the above.
0.5 <|###|> Nonsensical from the get-go, the girls' fish-out-of-water routine grows interminable.
0.125 <|###|> The film opens with the Duffs huffing and puffing their way through a remake of Madonna's 'Material Girl,' an ode to gold digging that Madonna sang with a touch of wry humor; the Duffs perform it as if it was 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'
0.6 <|###|> a safe, enjoyable movie that can be watched by yourself, on a date or at your mother's house after Sunday dinner
0.5 <|###|> It teeters between pleasantly generic film biography and rank manipulation.
0.6 <|###|> You could go see this just to enjoy the production design.
0.8 <|###|> Diane Lane delivers one of the finest performances of her career.
0.5 <|###|> Secretariat is cliched, unrealistic and predictable, but it will make you feel good
0.6 <|###|> This horse-sports-opera boasts all the ingredients for a successful run.
0.6 <|###|> Celebrates greatness on four legs with a decent--if not record-breaking--amount of light entertainment. What're the odds?
0.7 <|###|> Easily as good of a film as "Seabiscuit," and family-friendly.
0.6 <|###|> A heavily contrived and overlong account of the greatest US horse in racing history, Disney's Secretariat still has a lot going for it as an old-fashioned family drama.
0.4 <|###|> Secretariat is a good-natured but thunderingly cliched triumph-against-the-odds tale, almost every line a cornball aphorism about following your heart.
0.4 <|###|> Like Secretariat himself, the film is a glossy, big-hearted slow- starter, but lacks his ability to power home ahead of the competition.
0.4 <|###|> I'm sick of the simpering American morons who lap up this rubbish.
0.6 <|###|> With its linear structure, nostalgic glow and distinct lack of surprises, Secretariat seems to have wandered into cinemas after leaving its TV movie hitching post.
0.2 <|###|> Just when we thought John Malkovich didn't have another semi-intentionally deranged performance left in him, he has come storming back with another uproarious turn...
0.8 <|###|> I think this is one of the year's most enjoyable family films.
0.4 <|###|> Despite a decent performance from Lane as the homespun trainer, Secretariat is more blind alley than Blind Side.
0.2 <|###|> This tale of wealth, horse-breeding and good old Christian faith is just about as hammy as a study of commodified horse sex can be.
0.4 <|###|> Secretariat's story still feels untold.
0.4 <|###|> Don't put money on it.
0.4 <|###|> Bum-numbingly long bore that has a worrying number of talented actors seemingly involved for a cheque. Watch a film about dinosaurs instead; much more fun.
0.6 <|###|> This horsey, 1970s-set Disney film doesn't boast the most imaginative script and is too long and businesslike for youngsters -- yet it still produces a lump in the throat.
0.4 <|###|> Disappointing, frequently dull racehorse drama that's let down by poorly written characters, a thinly stretched plot, a painful lack of dramatic tension and a cliche-heavy script.
0.75 <|###|> Yes, it's a good, solid movie about a horse that no one expected to win.
0.625 <|###|> Penny Chenery's story is good stuff. It's just that watching it, one can't escape the nagging feeling that it's not the most compelling part of the (Secretariat) story.
0.8 <|###|> ... you will believe a horse can act.
0.5454545454545454 <|###|> Secretariat is basically an amiable crowd pleaser. It's a good film about a great horse.
0.625 <|###|> If you like sweet, safe tales of triumph, Secretariat is a sure bet. But if you like films with a bit more tension and complexity, this romp doesn't completely satisfy.
0.88 <|###|> ...oldstyle Hollywood, family entertainment done at a very high level. It doesn't lay out all the facts and complications, but it's a very honest movie.
0.625 <|###|> Despite the Disney-fied, sentimental side of the story, 'Secretariat' hits the finish line as an effective tale about an amazing equine athlete
0.6 <|###|> Well-crafted, shamelessly -- and obviously -- manipulative fantasyland stuff, passing itself off as a 'true story,' when, in fact, it's what we call 'fact-based.
0.25 <|###|> Watching Secretariat is an experience as antithetical to watching an actual horse race as it gets.
0.51 <|###|> Schmaltzy, uneven and contrived [despite] thrilling horse-racing scenes and John Malkovich's hilarious performance as an eccentric trainer who walked right out of a Christopher Guest movie.
0.6 <|###|> The horse's story entertains but it would have been nice to have more of the owner's personal life explored
0.5 <|###|> Crushingly unexceptional.
0.5 <|###|> It's not about a horse, it's jockey, or it's trainer. It's about a horse owner. Instead of honoring the greatest race horse ever, they try to find an underdog story with Diane Lane's help.
0.75 <|###|> Secretariat rides to the Winner's Circle.
0.6 <|###|> Like most Disney features, it is an inspirational event that will touch everyone.
0.8 <|###|> A throwback to an era where Disney churned these things out by the dozen, you?ll cheer, you?ll laugh, and wish you?d brought a hanky. There is, however, no photo finish.
0.625 <|###|> Until the Sports Illustrated subscription runs out at the Walt Disney Studios offices, I expect audiences will continue to be privy to cookie-cutter yarns centered around notable achievements in the sports world.
1.0 <|###|> As good as The Ring is, it can't top the original for sheer, shivering terror.
0.8 <|###|> A sure, stealthy shocker which certainly primes you for the sequel.
0.6 <|###|> David Cronenberg could perhaps compete with Nakata but unfortunately only lesser mortals have attempted to replicate the feeling that Reiko has plunged into something with which even her psychic powers can't compete.
0.8 <|###|> Ring has indescribably disturbing moments that frightened me out of my wits. But like many of the Japanese horrors that followed, it sometimes has an elliptic and confusing storytelling style that can make plot-progression muddy.
0.6 <|###|> The original retains its power to chill, although in the age of the DVD and the download, the idea of a haunted video cassette seems positively archaic.
1.0 <|###|> The finale, too, still feels as twisted, bizarre and down-right nightmarish as it did all those years ago.
0.8 <|###|> Subtly expressive faces and spooky interiors are the order of the day in this original, powerful treat.
0.8 <|###|> A landmark in horror cinema, Japan's Ring is arguably the most chilling pieces of popular supernatural cinema of the 90s.
0.4 <|###|> Bog standard horror offering with a distinct lack of action or plot.
1.0 <|###|> A blockbuster in Japan, this restrained horror film crosses urban legend conventions with Asian ghost story traditions, and the results are truly spooky.
0.9 <|###|> It hit something primal in me, turning me into a quivering ball of nerves; my 'fight or flight' switch was turned to flight and then broken off.
0.8 <|###|> It's hard to fairly judge a film like RINGU when you've seen the remake first. Many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity, [yet] are worthwhile.
0.75 <|###|> Neither inferior nor superior to the Hollywood version.
0.8 <|###|> Good ol' urban legend stuff.
0.8 <|###|> Contando com uma premissa curiosa, o filme mergulha o espectador em um clima de forte suspense, culminando em um desfecho que certamente fica na memoria.
0.8 <|###|> contrasting the original Ringu with the current Americanized adaptation is akin to comparing The Evil Dead with Evil Dead II
0.8 <|###|> If it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with Ring, an indisputably spooky film; with a screenplay to die for.
0.625 <|###|> If nothing else, this movie introduces a promising, unusual kind of psychological horror.
0.875 <|###|> Even if it's been tailor made for Japanese schoolgirls, it still had me screaming like one.
0.75 <|###|> Strangely sour and ultimately wearisome.
0.5 <|###|> If you really want to appreciate this film, go see all the hood movies from the 90s - good and bad.
0.4 <|###|> ...the Wayans use a sledgehammer to drive in a thumbtack.
0.4 <|###|> There's maybe three or four half-decent chuckles to be found in this otherwise interminable 90-minute mega-chore.
0.75 <|###|> The thin plot is merely the frame for gags, and there are more a few good ones here.
0.6 <|###|> Laugh yourself stupid....Wayans classic!
0.6 <|###|> A free-for-all comic spoof that brings the 'hood' genre of Hollywood films full circle.
0.5 <|###|> [A] pleasant hour and a half.
0.8 <|###|> One of the funniest movies of all time
0.2 <|###|> There are zero laughs in this stupid, stupid movie.
0.5 <|###|> The gags -- like most of the Wayanses' humor -- range from astute satire to lowest-common-denominator yucks.
0.625 <|###|> Rude, crude and outrageous.
0.1 <|###|> If I see one more movie featuring that current favorite of obnoxious movie stereotypes -- the pair of abrasive Asian convenience store owners -- I'm not going to even going to think twice before getting up and leaving the theatre.
0.9 <|###|> One of the best horror-thrillers of the classic era, and a massively inspirational piece of cinema.
0.8 <|###|> ...[a] demonic clockwork thriller.
0.875 <|###|> With barely any music, Clouzot unfolds the action with precision timing and suspense, culminating in one of the cinema's first and most memorable twist endings ever.
1.0 <|###|> set the bar high in terms of both its murderous, yet sympathetic characters and its tense scenario that mixes the conventional thriller elements of lust, jealousy, and homicide with the possibility of supernatural horror
0.8 <|###|> Still riveting stuff, beautifully acted out by Simone Signoret and Vera Clouzot, the director's wife.
1.0 <|###|> It's a diabolical masterpiece.
1.0 <|###|> Satisfying, elegant and nasty.
1.0 <|###|> This is a masterpiece that easily matches the best of Hitchcock.
1.0 <|###|> The ending, much copied, is justly famous. But it's the implacable build-up that seals its classic status...
1.0 <|###|> Delectable suspense with a grand payoff.
1.0 <|###|> First-class all the way (unlike the Sharon Stone remake)
0.86 <|###|> Avoids formulas, instead opting to take the audience down the same windy, confusing roads that the characters travel.
0.9 <|###|> A bitter chiller. One of the most suspenseful films ever made.
0.75 <|###|> ...[contains] some incredibly satisfying moments and a twist ending that's almost impossible to guess.
1.0 <|###|> This is one of the dandiest mystery dramas that has shown here in goodness knows when.
0.8 <|###|> One of the scariest moments ever.
0.8 <|###|> Everything that you need from a suspense thriller.
0.625 <|###|> It has the look and feel of one of the original Hitchcock movies from the 30s.
0.85 <|###|> A scary movie in the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, and while it isn't as well known, it's just as chilling.
0.875 <|###|> [Creates] a diabolical double-reverse plot that keeps the audience guessing right up to the thoroughly implausible final scene.
1.0 <|###|> With a deliciously curvy and complex plot, Diabolique is a masterpiece of suspense -- as accomplished as anything done by Hitchcock.
0.7 <|###|> Funny for families of all ages, this animated comedy is a rare and delightful treat.
0.75 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits is cinematic booty that shines like gold.
0.8 <|###|> The Pirates! is the first truly great animated film of the year: a painstakingly-modelled laugh riot that boggles the mind while tickling the funnybone.
0.625 <|###|> It's got great vocal talent and well-done animation, but it proves once again that the story is the key ingredient.
0.9 <|###|> A rollicking good time that offers enough broad comedy mixed with more cerebral sight gags to ensure this will be a family favourite for years to come.
0.625 <|###|> It's full of jokes for adults that will fly right over kids' heads, but retains just enough plot conflict and slapstick to keep younger audiences involved as well.
0.7 <|###|> The Aardman folks might not have created a pirate film to rival the big screen's best, but they've created a subtle parody of pirate movies that's well worth watching.
0.85 <|###|> Yes, the film feels childish, but in the best possible way.
0.6 <|###|> ... enough amusing throwaway gags to keep us entertained.
0.6 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits deserves two doubloons up. It shivered me funny bone.
0.875 <|###|> The fun, infectious tone is set early on and never peters out. The humor is kind of like Monty Python for kids.
0.75 <|###|> Droll and charming, and will probably appeal more to fans of Monty Python and 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' than to young kids...
0.8 <|###|> This is a very funny, very good looking movie getting lost in the fray.
0.75 <|###|> The best laughs come around the fringes, with great throwaway gags and Grant's usual self-deprecating way with dialogue.
0.5 <|###|> A few funny lines and a great vocal turn by Hugh Grant. All else is unexciting. Can't see the kids going wild over this one.
0.7 <|###|> Deserves no small amount of credit for being an absolute delight... and for never acting like the viewer is an idiot even as it never requires that the viewer be a genius.
0.8 <|###|> As a running gag, the man-panzee is pretty predictable, but as an observation of how cute creatures are perpetually manipulated and abused in family entertainments, it is rather rich.
0.875 <|###|> It's hard to emphasize enough just how intricate it is, abundant with rich details... At the same time, it's also warmly human, with characters so expressive you'll want to join the crew.
0.8 <|###|> The majority of the film can't quite live up to this barnstorming first half hour, but it remains a delight throughout, even when the gags become a little more hit and miss.
0.75 <|###|> Another winner from Aardman
0.5 <|###|> I wish I could call the plot about a dodo bird 'whimsical,' but there just wasn't enough laughs from these 'Pirates.'
0.5 <|###|> The filmmakers have said they are already dreaming up a sequel. They needn't hurry. Whatever treasures these pirates have are well buried.
0.7 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits, succeeds in spite of a faint but persistent sense of factory settings and finishes.
0.625 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits fares OK against most modern toon flicks but pales next to other Aardman releases. How a person chooses to rate its success depends on whether one looks at a glass of water and views it as half-full or half-empty.
0.8 <|###|> a gem of a movie that deserves more praise and audience than it'll probably get
0.875 <|###|> Delivers all of the laughs, giggles and guffaws land lubbers like us want in a silly film like this.
0.6 <|###|> There is a lot to like about The Pirates!, especially for those of us who watch a lot of BBC America.
0.6 <|###|> Young and old alike love a good pirate yarn and the stop-motion specialists at Aardman Animations deliver the goods.
0.8 <|###|> Pirate adventure blends Victorian history, high-seas fun.
0.8 <|###|> Pirates haven't generated this many laughs since Johnny Depp's first dip into the Caribbean.
0.8 <|###|> Even with all the enormous pirate ships, detailed cityscapes and dazzling action, Pirates! is at its best when it focuses on the sillier, calmer moments.
0.3 <|###|> Justin Routt writes, directs, and stars in a film that amounts to little more than a laundry list of pet peeves. Humor is a matter taste and this humor mostly is not to my taste.
0.6 <|###|> Chaotic and far-fetched yet funny enough to have audiences rolling in the aisles.
0.4 <|###|> Given the broad drama of the series, their movie should be full of big ideas, and instead settles for redundant gags involving drugs, guns, and high school cliques.
0.875 <|###|> Remake or no, this movie is hysterical.
0.8 <|###|> 21 Jump Street gets the remake job done with tongue-in-cheek style & plenty of outrageous moments.
0.75 <|###|> Because of Bacall's skill at writing great comedic material and Lord's and Miller's talent behind the camera, "21 Jump Street" became more than what it originally appeared to be, which is a surprise I'm always grateful for.
0.85 <|###|> 21 Jump Street takes the basic concept of the original series, and uses it to create an action/comedy that is not only palatable to modern audiences, but appealing as well.
0.625 <|###|> Co-written, produced by, and stars Jonah Hill, who took exactly the right attitude towards the movie: He and his costar Channing Tatum embraced the stereotypes, laughed at themselves, and came up with a surprisingly funny film.
0.75 <|###|> ...feels more like a guerrilla stunt than a soulless and cynical cash grab. Hooray for Hollywood, I guess.
0.8 <|###|> Slick and funny as hell, 21 Jump Street is one of the best comedies of the year.
0.875 <|###|> A raucous, entertaining, and incredibly funny film that respects the premise of the original series...
0.6 <|###|> For an action comedy, "21 Jump Street" had less action or comedy than I expected. It felt as if I spent too much time waiting for something to happen-either for a joke to fire, or a pistol.
0.8 <|###|> The movie is perfectly pleasant, a smidgen too aware of itself but consistently sharp.
0.6 <|###|> While the film struggles at the start as Tatum and Hill share little chemistry, they improve minute by minute and are one of the shining lights by the end, their journey boasting a surprising emotional pull.
0.86 <|###|> t's less fun when the guns come out in the final act, but there's a moment late in the game that redeems the movie's predictable beats, before the whole thing dissolves into entropy and disorder.
0.7 <|###|> 21 Jump Street is nothing like the original series. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry and the strong beginning and ending do a pretty good job disguising the flabby middle. It's crass, self effacing, 'meta', stupidity and it works.
0.875 <|###|> Clever, profane and action-packed, '21 Jump Street' fairly leaps onto the big screen as one of the most enjoyable movies of the (still-admittedly young) year.
0.8 <|###|> The best comedy to be released so far this year.
0.8 <|###|> I'm as surprised as you that this film could end up being the funniest of 2012.
0.75 <|###|> Lord and Miller mine the script... for plenty of profane laughs as they set up Hill and Tatum as a hilariously off-kilter comedy duo.
0.5 <|###|> ...it doesn't help, either, that large chunks of the film have been improvised wholesale by the various actors, which only exacerbates the film's excessively slapdash feel.
0.375 <|###|> ... latest in endless slew of painful spoofs based on TV shows takes an OK premise and milks it for an occasional chuckle before devolving into a succession of increasingly lame sketches.
0.5 <|###|> They know it's a joke. But like high school itself, 21 Jump Street hits the wall about halfway in and even prom night can't save it.
0.8 <|###|> The humor squeezes just about all the giggle juice it can get out of the R rating. If you need a movie map, this 21 Jump Street is on the FAR side of town from Sesame Street.
0.625 <|###|> by no means a great comedy, but it does demonstrate that playing against the grain can be a good move, especially when the people in charge have run out of ideas
0.8 <|###|> It doesn't matter if you never saw the original, because this movie is a clever, fast-paced, action comedy...
0.9 <|###|> A good-natured must-see for fans of broad, silly comedies with a little something under the surface too. Bright, breezy and brilliant.
0.8 <|###|> It is funny because it is pointed and smart, and it is also funny because it is unusually crass, but the chief takeaway here should be that it is funny.
0.75 <|###|> Rigorous planning likely was involved in taking the dumb concept of "21 Jump Street" and turning it into something that seems so effortlessly brilliant.
0.7 <|###|> While hardly raising the bar in action-comedy, it's still a fun, irreverent, laugh-out-loud take on the beloved, small-screen original.
0.7 <|###|> I won't go so far as to say it's good, but 21 Jump Street is certainly better than it has any right to be.
0.7 <|###|> The humor may be coarse and crude but it is funny, and with these movies that is what counts.
0.4 <|###|> 21 Jump Street is a cockamamie movie. It's as rowdy as a dick joke. After the 21st dick joke, I wanted to jump off. And after the dick jokes there's a load of excrement jokes.
0.6 <|###|> It has a tone all its own: drunk enough to lower the inhibitions; not so drunk that it becomes unintelligible.
0.625 <|###|> Funny and clever but ultimately dispiriting, with a finale that affirms the queasy wink-wink legalized bullying of its early police-vs.-citizens scenes, and that associates manhood with a willingness to kill with a gun -- all for a cheap laugh.
0.8 <|###|> 21 Jump Street is as fresh and original a comedy you'll ever find that is based on a totally stolen concept. If only all Hollywood rip-offs could be this good.
0.7 <|###|> The film is driven more by its concept than by its plot but it's still a fun summer film.
0.625 <|###|> Expensive, a misfire, but perfectly servicable for what it is
0.6 <|###|> Delivers on the promise of an exciting genre mash-up but, even with a talented cast and revered team of writers, fails to weave a fulfilling story.
0.6 <|###|> Patchy, if enjoyable in parts, but nowhere near as awesome as that title suggests it should be.
0.5 <|###|> Jon Favreau's "Cowboys & Aliens" is a film that starts off with promise, but quickly loses its way as it tries to merge two different genres.
0.75 <|###|> Rather refreshingly what-you-see-is-exactly-what-you-get: a western with aliens grafted on, or a sci-fi invasion film with cowboys grafted on--nothing more, nothing less.
0.4 <|###|> A mercilessly boring, wasted opportunity that forgets to have a sense of humor, charisma, or aliens.
0.25 <|###|> While we were hoping and rightly expecting some old school magic from the director of Iron Man, the director of Iron Man 2 showed up.
0.75 <|###|> 'Reach for the skies' has a whole new meaning now. The science-fiction Western 'Cowboys & Aliens' is an entertaining, genre-blending romp. It's a serious movie, too - a drama with comedic moments - and that makes it all the more exciting.
0.6 <|###|> Not the Boys Own Adventure it could have been, but a fun - if often flawed - romp.
0.4 <|###|> No amount of gee-whiz techno-wizardry or nifty pop-cultural juxtapositions can save Cowboys & Aliens from two terrible truths: it has a dud script, and a dud director.
0.5 <|###|> full review at Movies for the Masses
0.7 <|###|> we get a standard story, some decent setpieces and only a few funny lines...Take the ride, but don't blame us if you end up saddle sore.
0.6 <|###|> Uma diversao eficiente que, sim, poderia ter explorado sua otima premissa com mais cuidado, mas que ao menos nao a desperdicou com "homenagens" tolas e auto referenciais.
0.4 <|###|> The two marquee stars don't interact much, the "big" action pieces are fairly ho-hum, and the movie just cowpokes along when it seems like it should be having a lot more galloping fun.
0.875 <|###|> I don't think too many people are going to wander into the theater expecting The Tree of Life. The film delivers exactly what it promises.
0.4 <|###|> So in much the same way that 'Transformers' is essentially a robot war with a few humans stumbling around trying to get laid; this film should really have been called 'Alien Bracelet Vs. Aliens... With Some Cowboys Falling Off Their Horses'.
0.5 <|###|> The cowboys: great. The aliens: not so much. There's fun to be had here, but it falls way short of the pulp classic it could have been.
0.4 <|###|> A film where the occasional sense of fun is far outweighed by the omnipresent sense of stupid.
0.3 <|###|> Overall, a dull, overblown and forgettable farrago.
0.7 <|###|> There is nothing that fascinating about Favreau's treatment, nor his source material, but compared with similar blockbuster fare of recent months, this curious exercise in genre bending is very watchable.
0.6 <|###|> There's no doubt seeing a cowboy leap from a horse on to a spaceship is all kinds of awesome.
0.6 <|###|> I wanted to more than love Cowboys & Aliens. For two hours I wanted to feel 17 again.
0.4 <|###|> The men's relationship is dull and under-explored and the plot is slow, unexciting and silly. Craig is a lot more fun in a tuxedo than a stetson.
0.6 <|###|> If you can swallow the shameless set-up, it's all highly entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> Jon Favreau handles the big setpieces with competence if no great flair; whenever the plot backs itself into a corner something else will make a sudden, inexplicable interruption.
0.8 <|###|> A wild and spaced-out horse opera.
0.4 <|###|> This is definitely a film of two halves - the first is a fantastic western-mystery, the second is a lazy and silly sci-fi.
0.4 <|###|> Why has there never been a film about cowboys beating up extra-terrestrials? This movie will give you a pretty good idea.
0.4 <|###|> Favreau ... allows the material's imaginative possibilities to flare up and fade away.
0.0 <|###|> The density of inanity at the conceptual core of this crass sci-fi western starring Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford pushes outwards, inflating fatuous substance and propelling bric-a-brac in all directions.
0.6 <|###|> The premise does pretty much what it says on the tin.
0.6 <|###|> For all its A-list ingredients of concept, cast and director, the resulting mash-up is merely a superior B-movie, as uncertain a fusion as potato on a pizza.
0.4 <|###|> Yes, yes, cowboys punching aliens in the face can be funny. But it doesn't make this silly endeavour worthwhile.
0.4 <|###|> The plot has so many holes and unexplained phenomena that it's hard to know where to begin.
0.4 <|###|> Craig is a bona fide action star who shouldn't be reduced to spitting out lines like "Demons took your gold" in a husky Southern drawl.
0.6 <|###|> Jon Favreau made a really good comic book adaptation out of the original Iron Man but like every director he's dependant on a good screenplay and this one relies on cliches and having taken on this mix of genres it actually isn't wild enough conceptually.
0.5 <|###|> Unfortunately, Cowboys and Aliens takes itself way too seriously to really ignite.
0.4 <|###|> What started as 'True Grit'-meets-'War of the Worlds' ends up closer to - whisper it - 'Wild Wild West'.
0.6 <|###|> Enjoyable, well made and superbly acted sci fi-slash-Western adventure that duly delivers both cowboys and aliens, though a little bit of humour wouldn't have gone amiss.
0.65 <|###|> As an historical reenactment it suffers from a great deal of simplification in order to make complex events quickly and easily understandable, and as a drama it suffers from a great deal of build that never really pays on it's promise.
0.5 <|###|> While the performances keep the film afloat, Kapur's over indulgent direction and his inadequate interpretation of history comes dangerously close to running it aground.
0.4 <|###|> odaje sve nedostatke i ograni%u010Denja olovnih vremena u kojima je nastao
0.8 <|###|> Every shot, every costume is decadent with color, and every single twitch of Blanchett's face is imbued with meaning as she negotiates her way through her warring roles of being a woman and being a queen.
0.4 <|###|> But saddled with this dopey script, [Blanchett] is stuck pulling a series of poses and wearing one ornate gown after another.
0.625 <|###|> Blanchett is again director Shekhar Kapur's greatest asset. His weakness is his tendency to fall back on silly, melodramatic contrivance better suited to popcorn fare than to a believable meditation on Elizabethan England.
0.8 <|###|> Betrayal, war, love triangles and most importantly, Cate Blanchett proves to be able to capture strength, anger and sadness better...
0.6 <|###|> This is an epic, to be sure, but it is also a melodrama, a soap opera of titanic scale and bluster.
0.2 <|###|> Figurinos, direcao de arte e fotografia sao exuberantes, mas fica ate dificil apreciar a performance de Cate Blanchett em meio a um roteiro tao estupido e a direcao "olhem-pra-mim-sou-Cecil-B.-DeMille!" de Shekhar Kapur.
0.4 <|###|> Menos interesante y mas rutinaria que la primera Elizabeth (de 1998), esta segunda parte vale la pena mas que nada por otra brillante composicion de Cate Blanchett.
0.4 <|###|> a muddle that subsumes [its] premise in a mighty attempt to be several things all at once, with an uneven delivery
0.625 <|###|> ... fearsome and passionate with its visual flair, but incredibly confused as to how it wants to address Elizabeth's life beyond what has already been realized.
0.8 <|###|> "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" is a worthy sequel to "Elizabeth". Cate Blanchett delivers the same performance that earned her so much praise the first time around. The epic feel harkens back to Hollywood's Golden Age.
0.5 <|###|> The elaborate costumes and set decoration provide the only interest.
0.5 <|###|> Unreliable as history and misguided as a contemporary allegory, Golden Age finally fails because it is a half-hearted spectacle, not even filmed in a widescreen format.
0.6 <|###|> Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth sequel is a beautifully shot, impeccably designed and largely entertaining drama, providing you're not a stickler for historical accuracy.
0.8 <|###|> If this is a film that irritates nearly as much as it pleases, we do get a sense of the times, and of the lady in question. The eyes, if not the brain, are certainly given a workout that they will remember.
0.6 <|###|> See it anyway for Blanchett's soulful modulation between queenly command and womanly anguish.
0.2 <|###|> Where Kapur's first Elizabeth was cool, cerebral, fascinatingly concerned with complex plotting, the new movie is pitched at the level of a Jean Plaidy romantic novel.
0.8 <|###|> Rich in colour, sumptuous costumes, political intrigues and the personal relationships which dominate Elizabeth once more.
0.6 <|###|> Kapur's film is visually arresting, each frame a work of art in miniature. But there is something rather breathless about the storytelling.
0.6 <|###|> Despite all that's going for it, you can't help thinking this movie could have been so much better.
0.5 <|###|> A handsome but shallow sequel.
0.4 <|###|> The film is just about worth seeing for the wigs and costumes. But Elizabeth: The Golden Age sank without trace in American cinemas, and I fear it will do the same here.
0.6 <|###|> A lesser movie compared to its 1998 predecessor, this sequel nonetheless delivers the sort of stirring drama and sweeping spectacle its subject demands. Blanchett, meanwhile, shines brightly enough in the title role to make Elizabeth III a certainty.
0.3333333333333333 <|###|> Making soap of statecraft, the film has plenty of juicy moments, but offers an inconsistent rather than complex view of Elizabeth.
0.6 <|###|> Sidelines Sir Francis Drake in favour of the dashing Raleigh, nicely summing up the film: all flash, very little bang.
0.6 <|###|> Over-indulgent and melodramatic, as is the nature of artistic mythmaking, The Golden Age will beguile and repel in equal measure. The performances are supreme, although some viewers may struggle to reconcile the director's epic intentions.
0.8 <|###|> Even though the script plays fast and loose with historical facts, that indomitable bulldog spirit rings true and holds you captive for the duration.
0.7 <|###|> It's flawed and it does feel longer because the big finale is less like a battle and more like an on-screen version of battleship, but Cate and Clive are still worth a look.
0.4 <|###|> Want to know what a gifted actress Cate Blanchett is? Watch her keep a straight face throughout Elizabeth: The Golden Age.
0.7 <|###|> The film is beautifully shot, filling the screen with brightly saturated hues that give it an almost fairy tale-like visual sense, rather like a series of Pre-Raphaelite paintings brought to life.
0.625 <|###|> okay, but more silver than gold this time out.
0.5 <|###|> The script is the flowery prose of an overly earnest high school student.
0.375 <|###|> The movie contains the usual palace intrigue and overblown dialogue. The only line missing is the one referring to Elizabeth as a "king in petticoats."
0.7 <|###|> Golden Age starts well, and with sharp wit and crisp dialogue. But as the story moves toward the tentative romance with Raleigh, the film drifts into melodrama...
0.75 <|###|> Bigger and more exciting than its intimate predecessor.
0.25 <|###|> Breasts heave and the sea storms as historical music swells in Shekhar Kapur's overwrought follow-up to Elizabeth.
0.3 <|###|> There are movies that are so bad they're good, and then there are movies that are so bad they're completely awesome.
0.75 <|###|> Cate the Great once again imbues the Queen with her captivating mix of steely strength, regal dignity, take-no-crap toughness, and intimate vulnerability.
0.6 <|###|> Girlhouse is just another nudie horror flick at first glance, but a strong finale finishes things off with a bloody, satisfying moneyshot.
0.7 <|###|> Girl House is an impressive first feature for Trevor Matthews. For a slasher film, there is suitable attention to detail and a reputable level of respect for all the characters.
0.25 <|###|> Puts the porn back in "torture porn." Pity the parents of these pretty young actresses.
0.5 <|###|> Fear Clinic is an ambitious project stitched together by unsteady hands, as the threads holding everything together threaten to unravel come the film's end.
1.0 <|###|> Cho's impressions of her mom are legendary among fans, and for good reason.
0.625 <|###|> When the material is funny, it's extremely funny.
0.75 <|###|> She can be funny even when she gets on her soapbox.
0.75 <|###|> Cho's bisexuality supplies her with double ammo when making sex jokes, which are her specialty.
0.7 <|###|> Cho's fearless in picking apart human foibles, not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience. Her delivery and timing are flawless.
0.4 <|###|> This is hardly big-screen stuff.
0.625 <|###|> Less structured and, as a result, funnier than Margaret's first!
0.75 <|###|> Cho is one amusing caustic storyteller. Sharply hilarious and brimming with heart-rendering frankness, Cho exposes herself through the raw observations of the engagingly cheeky comedy concert film Notorious C.H.O....a fearless showcase that's smart
0.625 <|###|> Has enough laughs to make it worthwhile for Cho's most devoted fans.
0.7 <|###|> Topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs.
0.875 <|###|> As hilarious as it is raunchy.
0.75 <|###|> There's never a dull moment here. Notorious C.H.O. is a Genuine R.I.O.T.
0.5 <|###|> Good for the fans but probably only so-so for everyone else.
0.75 <|###|> Cho offers some of her best material to date: jokes and stories that will no doubt embarrass and haunt her later in life -- a sign of truly raw, personal comedy.
0.6 <|###|> The best comedy concert movie I've seen since Cho's previous concert comedy film, I'm the One That I Want, in 2000.
0.6 <|###|> '...it's better to see her show live in the flash and flesh, but watching Notorious C.H.O. is better than no Cho at all.'
0.75 <|###|> An hour and a half of joyful solo performance.
0.75 <|###|> The difference between Cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited.
0.75 <|###|> Audiences who appreciate extremely raunchy humor will find the giggles flowing, but remember to bring the tissue, because you'll laugh until you cry.
0.875 <|###|> She's as rude and profane as ever, always hilarious and, most of the time, absolutely right in her stinging social observations.
0.875 <|###|> [Cho's face is] an amazing slapstick instrument, creating a scrapbook of living mug shots.
0.4 <|###|> Cho's fans are sure to be entertained; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I'm not one of them.
0.625 <|###|> Where last time jokes flowed out of Cho's life story, which provided an engrossing dramatic through line, here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines.
0.7 <|###|> Notorious C.H.O. has oodles of vulgar highlights.
0.6 <|###|> If you really want declare war on the culture of brainless glam, you have to get a bit smart and ugly. In this war, Cho is truly doing her bit.
0.7 <|###|> Cho's timing is priceless.
0.625 <|###|> In her first picture, she was as shrill as fingers across a blackboard. Much less shrill and repetitive this time, her act is more inviting to non-fans. Even so, I found it more cute than funny. I never laughed.
0.75 <|###|> With Notorious C.H.O. Cho proves she has the stuff to stand tall with Pryor, Carlin and Murphy.
0.7 <|###|> Raunchy though [Cho's] material is, it embraces all comers, regardless of gender, sexuality, race or ethnicity. And it's never been sharper -- or funnier -- than it is here.
0.5 <|###|> A hit- and-miss affair, consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as Cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped.
0.625 <|###|> Essentially a formulaic showcase for the provocative Korean-American's singular comedic styling.
0.7 <|###|> While jokes about her mother's indecipherable Asian accent are getting a little tired, the newer material ... demonstrates that Cho still knows what makes audiences tick.
0.8 <|###|> Brilliant, over-the-edge concert film.
0.7 <|###|> The air of Gallic nonchalance ensures you have a lot of fun watching Pinon and Ardant match wits. It's Dana, however, who anchors the story.
0.7 <|###|> An engaging, enjoyable slice of suspense from the French.
0.5 <|###|> Is it supposed to be funny, tragic or what? Even the characters don't seem too sure.
0.5 <|###|> Red herrings abound and audience frustration sets in. It's a pity because the film looks good and the Gilbert Becaud songs on the soundtrack are easy on the ear.
0.6 <|###|> It's filled with intriguing characters, it has a fascinating initial premise -- and then it runs off the rails.
0.8 <|###|> The ever-appealing Fanny Ardant and the enigmatic, pug-faced character actor Dominique Pinon have many subtle delights up their sleeves, and newcomer Audrey Dana is a revelation.
0.86 <|###|> ... about the creation of fiction, the way we spin lies together into a simulacrum of life - if there's any philosophical point of view beyond that it's that every narrative is necessarily an abridgment of truth.
0.875 <|###|> What's especially clever about the plotting is that anything that proves to be merely a red herring is then incorporated into another storyline.
0.75 <|###|> If this kind of storytelling is your cup of absinthe, Claude Lelouch makes it easy to sip appreciatively.
0.9 <|###|> In many ways, Lelouch's film is -- in its somewhat old-fashioned way (which isn't a pejorative) -- the most bracing dose of cinema I've seen all year.
0.75 <|###|> Provides one of the year's more memorable movie moments: a simple shot of a barn, overlaid with both the soothing crooning of a Gilbert Becaud pop song and the terrified squeals of a hog being slaughtered.
0.625 <|###|> Even if the game isn't entirely successful, it's fun to play along.
0.75 <|###|> It's intellectually cagey, potentially romantic, and, above all, an entertaining puzzle box of duplicitous people doing mysterious things, men and women.
0.75 <|###|> As fizzy and non-nutritive as a glass of sparkling wine, Roman de Gare is a crowd-pleasing blend of romance, farce and mystery that plays out a little like a Ruth Rendell mystery novel with Rendell herself as the chief suspect.
0.8 <|###|> Forty years after his breakout success as a filmmaker, Claude Lelouch makes something of a comeback with his playful and sexy whodunit, Roman de Gare.
0.6 <|###|> With elements of road movie, thriller and comedy as well as other genres, Tracks possesses a freewheeling appeal.
0.7 <|###|> Entertaining despite nearly fatal plot holes.
0.625 <|###|> I think I understand the alternative realities of the plot, and I concede the loose ends are tied up, sort of, but I didn't care.
0.8 <|###|> Don't go to the theater expecting too much and you can't help but leave with a smile on your face.
0.75 <|###|> Lelouch's deft touch with various cinematic styles, however surface, enables him to interweave pastoral elegy, quirky social comedy and thriller with fluid ease.
0.875 <|###|> An ingenuous knot of plot, expertly tangled, in which nothing is quite what it seems.
0.625 <|###|> Pinon and Dana are so striking together.
0.7 <|###|> Succeeds as a mystery, comedy and romance in unexpected ways.
1.0 <|###|> It's the smartest and best suspense movie you're likely to see for a while.
0.625 <|###|> Thanks to the able cast and crisp cinematography, it's mostly unpretentious and reasonably entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> In quite a balancing act, [Lelouch] has written a script that's a thriller, somber romantic comedy, and, for the first half, a tense road movie.
0.75 <|###|> Lelouch's film is the cinematic equivalent, enjoyable fluff that your mind will discard after the closing credits -- but worth seeing nevertheless.
0.6 <|###|> Begin Again is a delight, not only because of its infectious musical vitality but because it follows the unexpected forks in the road.
0.6 <|###|> It's not nearly as good as "Once" but still very charming and entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> John Carney's retread never gets close to replicating the stunning emotional core of Once. But for those seeing Begin Again from a fresh perspective, it's ( ... ) a more light-hearted ( ... ) alternative to the Coen Bros' Inside Llewyn Davis.
0.625 <|###|> The best thing about 'Begin Again' is what it's not. It's not a love story, or at least not a conventional love story; it's more of a friendship story between a man and a woman, which is something we almost never see in movies.
0.7 <|###|> I've seen happier endings in Oklahoma! and Singin' in the Rain, but this one feels genuine - and in an unexpected way, deeply satisfying.
0.6 <|###|> Knightley (supplying her own vocals, more than just competently so, by the way) and Ruffalo have a casual chemistry that works, and Levine is (perhaps unsurprisingly) totally right as a self-absorbed jerk.
0.8 <|###|> I really enjoyed this. It's such a nice surprise, because so many so-called feel-good romantic comedies these days are pretty ordinary but there's something special about this because there's a level of reality to it in the performances in the situations.
0.8 <|###|> There's a freshness to this film.
0.875 <|###|> Bonds born out of art, and specifically music, are nothing new in the movies, but Carney conveys the uniquely exhilarating romance of the creative process behind art like no other filmmaker.
0.8 <|###|> John Carney is not afraid of a cliche. After all, Begin Again is a musical, a genre that has always thrived on them. And he does know how to shape them to his own design, which is low-key and slightly tongue-in-cheek.
0.6 <|###|> Thankfully Begin Again doesn't take the predictable routes; it seems to actively reject the easy romantic tropes.
1.0 <|###|> People who love music, people who love great films, and people who love both, are sure to love 'Begin Again,' an exquisite film by John Carney, who wrought the equally superb 'Once.'
0.75 <|###|> You'll find a mismatched pair to pull for and a lot of sincerity in this musical romance by the creator of Once.
0.8 <|###|> In its best moments - which are not infrequent - is appealing mostly on the backs of watching interesting, capable people going on with their business in an engaged, focused manner.
0.875 <|###|> This is the kind of film that lifts your spirits. If you've had a bad day or are generally feeling down, it will cheer you up. If you're already feeling happy, it will make you even happier.
0.75 <|###|> ...breezy and consistently watchable...
0.8 <|###|> a light and dancing comedy about fresh starts
0.7 <|###|> A mostly pleasant but deeply flawed little film that gets by on its stars and a sense of generosity.
0.8 <|###|> I found it moving, funny and really rather charming, provoking more than enough laughter and tears to dispel my underlying anxieties about the "live" performances.
0.75 <|###|> The wholesome, hopeful, let's-put-on-a-show enthusiasm may sound hokey but it's actually infectiously joyful. At the same time, Carney roughs up the edges just enough to make this fairy tale seem somewhat accessible and realistic.
0.8 <|###|> The result is a film that, while fitting into various great traditions, still bears the unmistakable thumbprint of a singular film-maker.
0.875 <|###|> Carney's latest isn't quite the equal of Once, but who could have twice bottled that lightning?
0.75 <|###|> Irish writer-director John Carney is a master at depicting musicians on the cusp of something special.
0.75 <|###|> This soulful outing is sure to please music lovers. And isn't that everyone?
0.9 <|###|> Keira Knightley sings and so does the movie!
0.8 <|###|> A decent feel-good flick that features also decent music. The real reason to see it is the acting especially that of Mark Ruffalo who gives a career best performance.
0.8 <|###|> A cheery charmer that brings a smile to the face.
0.8 <|###|> Fans of Once - or, indeed, anyone with a heart - will be swept away by the gentle, sweet-but-sad story.
0.625 <|###|> Begin Again is a not-entirely-successful movie about not selling out; it's a theme that must concern Carney deeply.
0.89 <|###|> It's a movie that is painfully sincere and free of guile, with as close to a happy ending as these characters could ever get. If you like musicals, well, here's a good one.
0.6 <|###|> The gentle lightning of Once doesn't strike twice for Carney, but his latest music movie has charm beneath its slick surface - and Knightley and Ruffalo harmonise just fine.
0.6 <|###|> Keira Knightley plays Greta, a Norah Jones-like singer-songwriter... It's a typically brave performance from an actress who is always prepared to try anything.
0.6 <|###|> At times, the scenes are so canned they feel like soap opera. But the movie does have its fair share of decent moments thanks to Ruffalo and co-star Catherine Keener.
0.4 <|###|> It's all a bit easy - though quite nicely performed - and Knightley is never entirely convincing ...
0.625 <|###|> Can a meaningful glance mean as much as a kiss? In this film, it can, and that's enough.
0.75 <|###|> No matter how thin the drama, or thick the performances, the film's firefly-in-a-jar, midsummer night's whimsy and heart-on-its-sleeve optimism hath charms ...
0.6 <|###|> Keira Knightley brings a sweet soul to John Carney's delightful sort-of sequel to his low-fi hit, Once.
0.6 <|###|> The film is a fairy tale: sentimental but enjoyable if you put a few protective fingers in front of your face to avoid being slurped to death.
0.4 <|###|> John Carney returns with another feature-length music video, turning the surprising charm of his debut, Once, a novel take on the modern musical romance, into a shameless gimmick. Just call it Twice.
0.6 <|###|> Knightley's bullish Britishness and Ruffalo's bruised charm provide a pleasingly gentle, unsentimental chemistry and, heck, there's even James Corden on a kazoo.
0.65 <|###|> They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but it can make for some awfully dull films. The line between inspiration and imitation is fine crossed repeatedly. Pride and Glory isn't the worst offender, just the latest.
0.25 <|###|> No button remains unpushed, no shred of scenery remains unshredded and no F-bomb remains unuttered.
0.625 <|###|> Pride and Glory doesn't add anything to the generic crooked-cop procedural that we haven't seen with more verve in better movies.
0.6 <|###|> This predictable police corruption story with an A-list cast explores themes of family and honesty as two cop brothers uncover the dirt on their brother-in-law's violent activity, while senior cop Dad tries to keep things under control.
0.6 <|###|> Uma pena que o filme jamais consiga escapar realmente do lugar comum, implodindo de vez em seu terrivel terceiro ato.
0.3 <|###|> Hard to watch, hard to listen to and hard to follow.
0.4 <|###|> The actors in Pride and Glory do their best with this cliched material, but the film is so grim, ugly and miserable that it's difficult to sympathise with even the most positive characters.
0.6 <|###|> Director and co-writer Gavin O'Connor is the son of a former New York policeman, and displays a strong grasp of the familial and fraternal ties that bind his characters together.
0.6 <|###|> While its kinetic appeal does have a numbing - if temporary effect - on your critical faculties, television has been much more successful in claiming this territory as its own.
0.5 <|###|> Relentlessly dour, filled with unsympathetic characters, and made out of cardboard melodrama. It's the last of those sins that is unforgivable. [Blu-ray]
0.5 <|###|> ...only skims the surface of its characters and offers nothing new in the way of corrupt law enforcement.
0.75 <|###|> Elevated by superb performances, led by Edward Norton and a very chilling Colin Farrell.
0.5 <|###|> What's especially lamentable is that this movie strands yet another exemplary turn by Edward Norton, who once again is superior to the material surrounding him.
0.4 <|###|> Pride and Glory is a bleak, boring and hopelessly familiar corrupt cop story that simply does not work despite the determined, top-of-their-game efforts of O'Connor and Norton, not to mention Colin Farrell, Jon Voight and others.
0.6 <|###|> A well-acted and tightly structured piece that would be more impactful if there weren't a feeling that we've seen it before.
0.3333333333333333 <|###|> Bloody, violent and increasingly derivative, 'Pride and Glory' betrays its initial promise as a small-scale, 'Godfather'-esque social tapestry with crude plotting, variable acting and an all-too-guessable storyline and conclusion.
0.5 <|###|> Solid yet unremarkable, Pride And Glory will never win points for originality. With committed turns from Norton and Farrell, it does enough - just - to keep you interested. But this is one film that neither covers itself in pride or glory.
0.2 <|###|> A detonation of flatulent, macho-sentimental gibberish is what this ugly and violent film positively farts out of the screen at you.
0.4 <|###|> But, hackneyed, unconvincing and ultimately preposterous, Pride and Glory should be made to hand in its badge.
0.8 <|###|> It doesn't quite pack the wallop that O'Connor intended, a daft fight near the end may evoke laughs and it probably won't be storming the Academy, but don't be shocked if you enjoy this as much as Marty's Oscar victor.
0.0 <|###|> Here's an excruciatingly dated and derivative New York cop movie.
0.6 <|###|> After similar but much better fare such as Martin Scorsese's The Departed and The Wire TV series, we've come to expect an awful lot from our bent copper dramas and, while satisfactory, Pride And Glory just isn't in the same league.
0.4 <|###|> When Noah Emmerich, who plays Tierney's NYPD brother, said "this s*** ends now", the Sneak thought "glory be" - only for the story to drag on for another 20 minutes.
0.6 <|###|> This bad-apple cop drama is the kind of movie that Sidney Lumet used to make in the Seventies and Eighties, and it hasn't evolved a great deal since.
0.4 <|###|> However skilful Gavin O'Connor is as a film-maker - and there are some striking sequences here - we've seen this corrupt cop thriller a hundred times before.
0.6 <|###|> Watchable cop thriller with strong performances and suitably gritty direction, but the climax gets bogged down in some embarrassingly awful cliches.
0.5 <|###|> If cop movie cliches are a crime against cinema, Pride and Glory should be under arrest.
0.4 <|###|> Christmas is definitely cancelled in this over-acted, over-here movie. Presumably the tinsel was CGI'd in to complement the season of its release.
0.4 <|###|> passionate performances in a story that is a series of letter-perfect cliches
0.8 <|###|> A dramatic, tense story of mixed loyalties in an NYPD family with standout performances by Norton, Farrell, Voight, Emmerich, and Ehle.
0.875 <|###|> Relentlessly grim, appropriately abrasive and beautifully filmed, "Pride and Glory" recalls Sidney Lumet's heyday. It proves there's still meat left on the bones of bad-cop thrillers, but it wisely doesn't offer a Handi-Wipe after its final course.
0.2 <|###|> It's a tale you've seen a good 100 times before, and if only 85 of those 100 are actually better than Pride and Glory, the other 15 aren't any worse.
0.625 <|###|> I'm not sure how many times the F bomb gets dropped, but it's more than you'll hear it in the average R-rated drama.
0.5 <|###|> Pride and Glory: Cops arrested by cliches.
0.6 <|###|> Run of the mill cop drama elevated only by the acting of the supporting cast - Jennifer Ehle is heartbreaking
0.4 <|###|> Norton and Farrell are both too good to have been shortchanged by this been-there-done-that script.
0.625 <|###|> That noise you hear is the soundtrack of We Own the Night, which is playing next door in the multiplex of your memory. Yes, there are undeniable similarities between the two pictures.
0.5 <|###|> Marijuana legalization is a hot button issue, ripe for boundary-pushing humor. Don't Legalize It oddly pulls back at the very moment when it should be charging forward with all its might.
0.5 <|###|> Given how established their roles are, Don't Legalize It could really use some sort of narrative pull, but it is mostly just content to stand in the middle and watch everyone circle in their fitfully funny ruts.
0.5 <|###|> It gets as stale as pot left too long in the freezer.
0.625 <|###|> You've got to take your toque off to a dumb movie that is clever enough to try to rook Ottawa politicians into doing the right thing for the wrong reason.
0.5 <|###|> It's tolerable because director Mike Clattenburg, who created the series, overlays the stumblebum ineptitude with a layer of affection.
0.8 <|###|> ...a crazed road trip to Chuckleville.
0.8 <|###|> Excellent updating of the classic drama
0.8 <|###|> Not nearly as good as the original, but still an incredible film.
0.8 <|###|> Nowhere near the original, but still worthy of high praise.
0.75 <|###|> This remake is worth viewing for the strength of the script and the fine performances.
0.5 <|###|> Where's the media attention and the constant attempts to take advantage of the poor girl? Even the lackluster Nell got that right.
0.375 <|###|> It is a huge missed opportunity on Crowe's part. In his attempt to show the best traits of a band he is obviously very enamored with, he's wound up with a pretty lackluster film.
1.0 <|###|> Very few music documentaries in the history of the form have more successfully conveyed the inner workings and outer artistic expression of a band than Cameron Crowe's brilliant Pearl Jam Twenty.
0.75 <|###|> [Crowe] merely wants to capture the personalities, the songs and the shows.
0.7 <|###|> With noticeable gaps between the telling of its first decade and its second, Pearl Jam Twenty didn't necessarily need to be a feature, but is a really lovely fan letter to a band that's worked hard for the devotion and respect it receives.
0.75 <|###|> With its intimacy and (this can't be emphasized enough) fantastic sound, Pearl Jam Twenty is like two hours spent rediscovering the band through excellent headphones.
0.4 <|###|> If only it was about something other than rockers almost irked they got famous.
0.625 <|###|> In a better film, Crowe would have played journalist instead of fan boy.
0.6 <|###|> By the time "Pearl Jam Twenty" is over we can't help but be impressed by the kind of personal and professional integrity that has kept the band honest and allowed them to endure and prosper.
0.6 <|###|> While the movie may not have the insight of D. A. Pennebaker's "Don't Look Back" or even Phil Joanou's U2 travelogue, "Rattle and Hum," Pearl Jam devotees will not go home musically unnourished.
0.875 <|###|> If Pearl Jam Twenty has its share of hyperbole, it's leavened with humor, self-deprecating commentary, and a deep-pockets budget's worth of great clips.
0.85 <|###|> A great introduction to the band as well as a great recap for the fans who have been there all along the way.
0.9 <|###|> For the biggest fans, it may be the single best movie going experience you will have this year
0.5 <|###|> Cameron Crowe's chronicle of the Seattle grunge quintet's first two decades is undeniably thorough - even offshoot Temple of the Dog gets the spotlight - but it's also weirdly self-aggrandizing.
0.75 <|###|> Any enterprise like this is inherently self-congratulatory, but the film is best considered from Crowe's perspective: that of a fan.
0.625 <|###|> A loving, gracefully crafted retrospective that shrewdly eschews Behind the Music conventions at most turns.
0.6 <|###|> Despite surrendering to sentimental fandom, Crowe thoughtfully touches on greyer areas...
0.6 <|###|> Entertaining, well made documentary that's a treat for fans thanks to its wealth of rarely seen footage and newly filmed interviews...
0.6 <|###|> The music's the thing and Crowe lets it rip.
0.4 <|###|> Vedder is charming, his band rather bland. As trips down memory lane go, it's a bit of a trudge.
0.7 <|###|> Fans will love this energetic documentary tracing more than two decades of the infamous grunge band. But while the film is packed with terrific footage, it's too worshipful for non-fans to take seriously.
0.25 <|###|> A deadly combination of fanboy, friend, and Richie Cunningham, Crowe has zero objectivity about the band
0.8 <|###|> The movie a man named 'Woody' was born to direct!
0.4 <|###|> Really dated, but clever concept.
0.8 <|###|> This should be a hit-and-miss effort, but it's mostly hits.
0.6 <|###|> Funny the first time. Multiple viewings offer nothing.
1.0 <|###|> Its ability to jump around vignette-style allows Allen to generously spread his hilarious schtick to a broad number of subjects without fear of dilution. One of Allen's unsung classics.
0.8 <|###|> Sperm can be fun!
0.8 <|###|> John Carradine as the mad scientist! Gene Wilder and the ewe! Tasteless, but funny; the sperm sequence is priceless.
0.6 <|###|> Too uneven to be good. Too good to ignore
0.8 <|###|> One of Woody's slightest efforts, to be sure, but it still delivers a healthy batch of laughs.
1.0 <|###|> Anderson is often mistakenly dismissed as a hack but the artist is actually working within the confines of Hollywood genre cinema, constantly transcending and elevating it through the triumph of his avant-garde visual sensibility.
0.4 <|###|> Looks are absolutely everything in Retribution, which melds stunning 3-D computer-graphics and spectacular sets with a skimpy storyline and zero characterization.
0.3 <|###|> More high-calorie, low-sense, audiovisual CGI stimulation arrives in the form of this fifth and most roundly unsatisfying entry in the previously lithe and fun videogame franchise.
0.6 <|###|> It's a funny thing about Jovovich as Alice: she gives the character just enough personality, but not enough to break the somber apocalyptic mood.
0.625 <|###|> The Resident Evil films are not everyone's bag, although they seem to be evolving into their own brand of hyper-stylized cheese, made more extreme with each outing.
0.65 <|###|> For those of us who know what we're in for with the series, the fifth installment is for better or worse, more of the same - albeit with the familiar levels of ridiculousness from its maddeningly inconsistent director/writer
0.4 <|###|> You can put as much gloss on top of the shaky foundations and wooden acting as possible but as soon becomes apparent - you can't varnish a turd.
0.6 <|###|> If you liked the other Resident Evil films, you'll like this, and the end suggests there'll be plenty more.
0.4 <|###|> More than ever, forgoes real attempts at character and story for lots of repetitive zombie skirmishes.
0.4 <|###|> Resident Evil: Retribution is style-over-substance in every possible definition of the concept.
0.2 <|###|> Even noisier, more incoherent, and more like watching someone play a shooter-style video game than its predecessors.
0.4 <|###|> While the last movie felt clean and more character-focused, this one seems a good deal lazier, both in the writing and directing departments.
0.5 <|###|> 'Regurgitation' might be a more appropriate subtitle for this redundant fifth go-round...
0.5 <|###|> Containing almost no story, Resident Evil: Retribution shows the series' video-game origin more than ever.
0.4 <|###|> Nobody goes to a Resident Evil movie expecting a classic but this fifth entry in the series is just plain cruddy.
0.5 <|###|> Milla Jovovich is still a great action heroine, but the movie is just more of the same old stuff.
0.125 <|###|> Uwe Boll gets most of the scorn, but has anyone done more to destroy hope of a decent movie being made from a video game than Paul W.S. Anderson?
0.4 <|###|> It takes a while for the film to start being bad.
0.625 <|###|> A mildly entertaining piece of eye-candy.
0.3 <|###|> Dreary,loud and uber-violent but, having grossed nearly $700 million worldwide, there's no stopping this franchise.
0.4 <|###|> 'Resident Evil: Retribution' does feel like a miniscule improvement over 'Afterlife,' but should still be considered overkill for a franchise that has already run its course.
0.25 <|###|> A visually-captivating fantasy for teenage males with raging hormones, the demographic most apt to enjoy watching an invincible vixen in spandex waste wave after wave of mindless mutants.
0.25 <|###|> The script is incoherent and the acting is terrible -- avatars would have been an improvement.
0.2 <|###|> Thuddingly awful.
0.375 <|###|> "Resident Evil: Retribution" brings us to the fifth entry in a series that ran out of steam a long time ago.
0.4 <|###|> A zombie plague may have laid waste the world, but apparently supplies of black leather unitards have yet to be exhausted.
0.7 <|###|> Giving their growing fanbase exactly what it expects, director W.S Anderson and Milla Jovovich deliver another thick slice of slick, glossy, futuristic action pulp.
0.4 <|###|> Nao tem historia; tem fases.
0.6 <|###|> Paul W.S. Anderson's writing may not have blown minds and our characters may not be up for any awards, but Resident Evil: Retribution showcases tantalizing big budget action on a stylistically provocative level.
0.5 <|###|> Anderson's action chops are undeniable - but Resident Evil: Retribution might be one of the dumbest things ever crafted by human hands.
0.625 <|###|> You either enjoy buff female and male characters in tight, form-fitting outfits shooting at zombies and each other, or you don't. It's really that simple.
0.3 <|###|> I half-believed this movie was, indeed, a video game that Paul W.S. Anderson was playing in his underwear while smoking a bong.
0.8 <|###|> a work so completely removed from lucidity or linearity that if it bore the signature of Luis Bunuel or Seijun Sezuki instead of that of Paul W.S. "The Other Master" Anderson, it would be celebrated as a masterpiece of experimental cinema.
0.875 <|###|> At this point in the franchise, Anderson is content to alight the saga on a perpetual rewind loop, ever-ending, ever-rebooting, all subsidized by his nonpareil compositional sense.
0.375 <|###|> Director Paul W.S. Anderson really nails the feeling of a character walking into a room and opening fire upon a horde of nondescript bad guys, then walking into another room and doing the exact same thing, ad nauseum.
0.4 <|###|> Most franchises which make it to 5 movies start to run out of ideas by then, but if Retribution has one glaring problem it's that it has far too many of them.
0.6 <|###|> Resident Evil movies don't tell stories so much as they provide variations on a theme, and that theme is: a pubescent boy's wet dream recast as an antiseptic dub-step nightmare
0.25 <|###|> "At last," Alice narrates, "we thought we had survived the horror." But no.
0.6 <|###|> You may not want to hang around [Hunter S. Thompson] all the time, but he would be a pretty interesting guy to have over for breakfast.
0.875 <|###|> ...wildly entertaining...
0.7 <|###|> Do we get to know the real Hunter through viewing Breakfast with Hunter? Possibly. More than ever before, at least.
0.8 <|###|> Breakfast With Hunter is a cinematic exploration that is perhaps the closest you can get to Hunter Thompson without scoring an invite up to the 'fortified compound'.
0.64 <|###|> Takes a peculiarly predictable and conventional approach to its study of the godfather of gonzo journalism, Hunter S. Thompson
0.5 <|###|> Curiously prosaic for the wicked incisiveness of its subject.
1.0 <|###|> Ever wish you could see what goes on behind those famed, heavily fortified walls of Owl Farm? Here's your invitation.
0.6 <|###|> A very interesting experiment that combines moments of mad brilliance with outbreaks of pretentious tedium in about equal measure.
0.6 <|###|> Mini skirt girl power continues.
0.375 <|###|> The special effects sequences, silly jokes, tantalizing outfits and overbearing soundtrack seem painfully forced and fake. Or maybe a better word is shallow. This film, for whatever it achieves, is painfully shallow.
0.0 <|###|> Well, at least the title is apt -- this aggravatingly incoherent series of subpar music videos did make me want to see someone fully throttled.
1.0 <|###|> Once again, the tone is that of a giggly, sweetly knowing, megabucks slumber party.
0.4 <|###|> To paraphrase Steven Soderberg, if having fun on a set was an indication of how good the movie will be then Cannonball Run would be the greatest movie ever made.
0.1 <|###|> This thing is pure garbage.
0.2 <|###|> Stupid stunts that defy rational belief, wasted casting that infuriates and annoys, and more skin than any woman with a brain, agent and reputation should display on screen.
0.6 <|###|> [A]s with the first film, it's a complete goof, meant to be enjoyed with a large popcorn and lots of air conditioning.
1.0 <|###|> Full Throtle is full of fun.
0.125 <|###|> If you want to see what $125 million worth of nothing looks like, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is the picture for you.
0.45 <|###|> A lot less fun than 2000's Charlie's Angels, this sequel made for the ADD generation jumps from one thing to the next like a mongoose on crack, and yet comes up with nothing.
0.8 <|###|> That Full Throttle is an exuberant, eye-catching and infectious film despite a script that probably only exists in theory proves that director McG is a damn McGenius.
0.4 <|###|> Runs out of juice the faster it tries to reach a conclusion. Nice outfits, though.
0.6 <|###|> Taking hokey acrobatics to an over-the-top extreme, the Angels are as unbelievable as three Xenas on a caffeine high with some of the craziest action sequences ever conceived
0.625 <|###|> A high spirited ride that just goes on too long.
0.75 <|###|> A startling/shining example of Hollywood's ability to absorb everything, including anti-Hollywood sentiment, and regurgitate it as something sexier, flashier, more fun, and less filling.
0.4 <|###|> E possivel que nao haja nada para ser compreendido em As Panteras 2 alem do fato de que garotas bonitas nao sao sujeitas a acao das leis da fisica.
0.5 <|###|> Monte d'un cran ou deux les caracteristiques detestables du premier film.
0.5 <|###|> By the time Demi Moore leapt from a building and flew through downtown Los Angeles like Neo, my brain gave up and wearily waved the white flag.
0.6 <|###|> Perfect brainless Friday night entertainment.
0.75 <|###|> 'Un delicioso placer culpable que puede ser disfrutado perfectamente por cualquiera que vaya a la sala de cine sin esperar una historia profunda o seria.'
0.5 <|###|> Charlie's Angels was fun. For some reason, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle chooses to be insanely incoherent instead.
0.9 <|###|> Do not go in here expecting "an action movie" or an "up with people especially girls" kind of flick. This is basically PG-13 porn. And it's a blast.
0.8 <|###|> Just as much fun as the first one.
0.375 <|###|> The term eye candy has never felt more apropos.
0.6 <|###|> Director McG has a lot of get-up-and-go, but it's never quite clear where all his go is supposed to be going -- other than to the next set-piece.
0.75 <|###|> Stylish, lip-stick-slick, these flicks' opening schticks are like a short-wick cracker brick.
0.625 <|###|> Bigger, louder, and more gratuitous (because 'naked-er' isn't a word).
0.5 <|###|> It's loud, energetic and popping with enough eye candy to induce pancreatic shock in a sperm whale - and the best part? It has absolutely no plot.
0.4 <|###|> It amounts to cinema for goldfish, so empty that even the makers can't remember what happened five seconds ago.
0.5 <|###|> Cool! clearly aspires to be in the tradition of lost-boys masterpieces Los Olvidados and Pixote, but is too exploitative to succeed as a cautionary tale and too cautious to succeed as an exploitation picture.
1.0 <|###|> A textbook example of the perfect crowd-pleaser.
1.0 <|###|> The biggest impression left by Yojimbo is the characterization of Sanjuro, whose iconography of stoic cool (that inspired Clint Eastwood's antiheroic "Man with No Name") is consistently undercut with dashes of comical realism...[Blu-ray]
0.9 <|###|> This is one of those movies where it sounds like none of it should work and yet all of it somehow does.
1.0 <|###|> Even Eastwood's Man With No Name is inspired, perhaps, by the samurai in Yojimbo.
0.9 <|###|> The explosive outbursts of violence in Yojimbo are superbly choreographed, with Kurosawa's customary use of a telephoto lens creating a hallucinatory feeling.
0.5 <|###|> Despite the sometime appearance of the whole thing as a forthright travesty, it does have stretches of excitement and cinematic power.
1.0 <|###|> Japan's definitive leading man, Toshiro Mifune, wields wits that are even deadlier than his Katana. Funny, clever, and never a dull moment.
1.0 <|###|> It is fair to say that, without Yojimbo, certain key aspects of Western cinema would not be the same today.
0.8 <|###|> Every shot in this film is a textbook study of camera movement and placement, composition in depth, and the use of deep-focus photography.
0.875 <|###|> There's no denying its snappiness. Whenever you shut your brain off, it hums amicably right along.
0.8 <|###|> Overall, 'twas a good movie, albeit kind of strange.
0.92 <|###|> One of Japan's great contributions to cinema, the inspiration for spaghetti Westerns and the introduction of a new kind of film hero.
0.8 <|###|> Great beginning and ending, but drags a bit in the middle.
0.9 <|###|> Massive amounts of swordplay and treachery turn it into one of the most entertaining and best Kurosawa films.
0.8 <|###|> Here, finally, Clark takes the skankiness out of teen sex, making it into a romantic idyll.
0.75 <|###|> Because the filmmakers cook up an equal number of touching sequences to match their disturbing ones, their portrait of disturbed America comes through clearly and effectively.
0.2 <|###|> well-shot, but it is the only good thing that could be said about KEN PARK
0.6 <|###|> Ken Park leads viewers, fans, and detractors to wonder, "What the hell is this guy doing?"
0.2 <|###|> Pornografia infantil disfarcada de "arte".
0.75 <|###|> Less a film than a moment in time--at least that's what Ken Park's dreamy bookends would have you believe.
0.2 <|###|> Parental figures are one-dimensional. Behavior becomes extreme and absurd, making the film laughable.
0.5 <|###|> The film is fascinating, but sort of like watching a road accident.
0.25 <|###|> The worst film I've seen since... Well, "Bully".
0.875 <|###|> Makes Happiness look like Dumbo.
0.9 <|###|> A savage attack on American comfort.
0.8 <|###|> functions equally well as revenge drama, moral fable, and no-holds-barred condemnation of dog-eat-dog capitalism
0.79 <|###|> Dassin's film emerges as a rather searing, wide-reaching indictment of the necessary evils of doing business in the United States
0.875 <|###|> Dassin swathes Thieves' Highway's long-haul boys in claustrophobic compositions and menacing darkness.
0.6 <|###|> "The Barefoot Bandit" never coalesces into a complete portrait of a fascinating figure, but it has its moments of difficult truth.
0.6 <|###|> ...a fascinating dossier, even if the protagonist remains somewhat an enigma. Or perhaps because of it, "The Barefoot Bandit" makes a case for a modern-day folk hero.
0.6 <|###|> Sing carols to your babies instead.
0.875 <|###|> Nothing is put together for you, but all the pieces of the puzzle are there for you to create what you want. It's refreshing to see a movie that is completely out of the box, and doesn't follow any present forumla. THE WALL is a great rock opera.
0.8 <|###|> Visually stunning and disturbing, an essential midnight movie.
0.8 <|###|> A stunning portrayal of a slide from isolation into madness. And the music rocks, too--bonus.
0.4 <|###|> One of Alan Parker's few truly bad movies.
0.8 <|###|> Visually stunning yet strangely forced tale.
0.6 <|###|> dated and self-aggrandizing but a watershed
0.4 <|###|> Good music. Sick imagery.
0.8 <|###|> A midnight movie classic!
0.6 <|###|> Late Phases is a fun werewolf flick with a sweet, climactic last stand.
0.5 <|###|> Damici gives his memorable protagonist enough life to hold it together more often than it would have otherwise. He's great here. The movie around him, not so much.
0.3 <|###|> Late Phases transforms from laughably non-frightening horror film to self-serious family drama and back again, all the while remaining ferociously, ravenously boring.
0.625 <|###|> Adrian Garcia Bogliano ends up merely toying with the death-steeped concerns of his characters, and taking the furious and bitter perspective that powers the narrative's ponderous dramatic core for granted.
0.4 <|###|> Another raunchy race toward the first time; adults only.
0.3 <|###|> I don't know who's out there buying the American Pie video sequels, but I sure do wish they'd stop.
0.2 <|###|> Crude, sure. Vulgar, no doubt. But funny? Not at all.
0.3 <|###|> I never thought I'd believe that the characters in American Pie were rich and nuanced, but compared to the disjointed, half-written affair here, they may as well be from Shakespeare.
0.2 <|###|> Aggressively obnoxious FX comedy with Chase at his absolute hammiest.
0.25 <|###|> Exacerbating matters is [Chevy] Chase's performance, which is incredibly obnoxious even by his standards.
0.4 <|###|> It's probably best to think of the film as an extended music video, a watershed moment for movie sound tracks, and not much more.
0.6 <|###|> ...there is so much good music involved...it easily distracts one's mind from the clunky histrionics.
0.4 <|###|> The musical performances are memorable, everything else is forgettable
0.2 <|###|> Bland Prince vehicle that takes itself far too seriously.
0.6 <|###|> intriguingly well-told story
0.4 <|###|> Those who are looking for a two-hour music video with a coherent story will not be disappointed.
0.875 <|###|> The performers have a bit of a wink behind their performances, and so the artificiality meshes together neatly.
0.375 <|###|> Purple Rain shares a trump card--its set list--with casual Prince fans, who are advised to reach for the soundtrack album instead.
0.75 <|###|> Purple Rain's gazillion-selling soundtrack album has more or less eclipsed the film in pop culture history books.
0.6 <|###|> Short people of Hollywood...DANCE!
0.8 <|###|> it isn't much of a movie, but it's one hell of a show
1.0 <|###|> A classic '80s rock movie, whose soundtrack was perhaps the best album of the decade.
0.6 <|###|> Prince is one of the most talented musicians of our time. His movie doesn't quite reflect that, but it's in Minneapolis, so it's cool.
0.6 <|###|> So-so picture that is most notable for the terrific musical sequences featuring Prince and his band.
0.6 <|###|> You'll have a rockin' good time!
0.4 <|###|> Where are all those people who called this "the Citizen Kane of rock movies" hiding?
0.6 <|###|> Great music, mediocre plot and acting.
0.5 <|###|> Although there are plenty of positive, feel-good elements to this movie, they are outweighed by missed opportunities to do something more valuable.
0.75 <|###|> As a romantic comedy...neither exceptional nor groundbreaking. But as a musical, the movie bursts with foot-stomping, arm-swaying, finger-snapping gospel music.
0.8 <|###|> The Fighting Temptations is a movie that will soften even the most cynical moviegoer. You can see most of it coming a mile away, and it still works.
0.6 <|###|> All about the music, and you'd have to be truly tone-deaf not to respond to its soaring harmonies and spirited spirituality.
0.5 <|###|> It feels more like an artificial fable than a story we can sink our teeth into.
0.625 <|###|> Cuba Gooding Jr. [is] so animated a performer that he even appears to be overacting on this movie's poster.
0.4 <|###|> This film would have been better with a lot more gospel and a lot less Gooding.
0.5 <|###|> Gooding is on a downward spiral, but The Fighting Temptations is at least a step above Snow Dogs and several above the inexcusably offensive Boat Trip.
0.375 <|###|> Fight the temptation to look for anything more than good music in this movie.
0.49 <|###|> The lack of gross-out moments is refreshing, as is the way that it never sacrifices its character-driven plot to a discordant comic set piece.
0.625 <|###|> Crowd-pleasing but shoddy... During a funeral scene, the corpse can clearly be seen breathing...
0.3 <|###|> Is The Fighting Temptations a washed up comedy or a monotonous musical?
0.5 <|###|> Cuba Gooding Jr. once again (shows) he and comedy do not belong in the same area code (and, come to think of it, after 'Boat Trip,' did anyone need further evidence?).
0.6 <|###|> I wish the writers had been tempted to write a better story.
0.4 <|###|> The filmmakers seem to have meant to offer up a spiritual message about community and faith, but it's muddled and hard to find with romance, comedy and phenomenal gospel performances all fighting for the spotlight.
0.6 <|###|> Has practically nothing to recommend it save its music: Take that away and Jonathan Lynn's movie is as ordinary as an unsold TV pilot episode. But what music.
0.75 <|###|> I've looked forward to Cuba Gooding Jr. movies as eagerly as I anticipate SPAM, but The Fighting Temptations breaks his streak of crumminess.
0.375 <|###|> If you're a gospel lover, you can probably overlook the technical flaws, especially if you see it in a crowded and enthusiastic theater.
0.625 <|###|> The Fighting Temptations exists for its rousing gospel soundtrack, which is at times so good that you can forgive the movie its flaws.
0.75 <|###|> The music is glorious.
0.5 <|###|> Can this career be saved? After watching The Fighting Temptations, you may feel that Cuba Gooding Jr.'s may not.
0.8 <|###|> The most tuneful gospel movie since Say Amen, Somebody.
0.5 <|###|> A woefully thin and pointless musical comedy.
0.4 <|###|> The story is slapdash and most of the jokes are lame, but music by the Reverend Shirley Caesar and the Blind Boys of Alabama lends fleeting touches of a grace that's, um, amazing.
0.4 <|###|> It's not graceful. It's not smart. But it's sweet and cute, and that will do until a real romantic comedy comes along.
0.5 <|###|> A messy, sprawling family barbecue of a movie that barely gets by on salesmanship, energy and maybe more than a little chicanery.
0.625 <|###|> A hoot and a holler.
0.75 <|###|> A raucous gospel comedy that's as broad as co-star Beyonce Knowles' vowels and chockablock with foot-stomping, up-with-the-choir music that will have even atheists praising the Lord.
0.625 <|###|> Its musical sequences could make the most hardened atheist want to go to church.
0.5 <|###|> When anyone opens their mouth to sing, it's good; when anyone opens their mouth to talk, it's bad.
0.6 <|###|> This movie is an 'everybody's welcome' temple to the synergies of both old and new musics.
0.6 <|###|> [A] half-forgotten little curio for later generations to study with puzzled delight.
0.6 <|###|> Car stunts, romance, and salty language in 1970s comedy.
0.75 <|###|> The movie benefits from some excellent vehicular stuntwork, an apt role for Burt Reynolds, the introduction of Jerry Reed's "East Bound and Down," a bright turn by Reynolds' real-life girlfriend Sally Field, and Jackie Gleason at his hammiest.
0.8 <|###|> quintessentially 70s and still a ton of fun
0.375 <|###|> The first in the series and the best of a lousy lot.
0.8 <|###|> A raucous blast with plenty of great lines. Gleason is an absolute riot.
0.8 <|###|> Gleason is the real show here, but it made Burt a huge star.
0.6 <|###|> Good, stupid fun, but a precursor to some awful copycats.
0.84 <|###|> The true mark of a good action flick is that it knows when to play dumb and when not to.
0.25 <|###|> Laughable exploitation film results in a complete waste of time and talent.
0.4 <|###|> One of those movies that's a nailbiter for a little kid, but laughable when revisted as an adult.
0.2 <|###|> The movie swarmed into local theaters yesterday; unfortunately, the insects and the people in this melange of ersatz science-fiction and dull adventure deserve one another.
0.2 <|###|> Teaming Collins with ants is pure Bert I. Gordon.
0.2 <|###|> We interrupt this soap opera to bring you... a monster movie!
0.2 <|###|> Bring on the DDT. A silly giant-bug opus with cheap special effects.
0.2 <|###|> What's scarier: ants or Bert I. Gordon movies?
0.09 <|###|> If you find it when you are flipping through channels at three in the morning, turn it off and try to get some sleep.
0.6 <|###|> Just as the relationships at the core of this drama, The Yellow Handkerchief is one big compromise. Make do with the lackluster parts and receive something uniquely pleasant.
0.625 <|###|> A well-acted little film, The Yellow Handkerchief captures the loneliness of these characters and the sparks of hope they harbor, despite everything.
0.75 <|###|> This uplifting film is an indie gem with a wonderful payoff that will bring you to tears. The acting is superlative and makes this emotionally moving experience good to the last drop.
0.5 <|###|> When The Yellow Handkerchief finally hooks into the meat of Hamill's source story, the narrative tension puts enough wind in the film's sails to arrive at its corny but sentimentally satisfying conclusion.
0.5 <|###|> The only positive thing about the aimless film The Yellow Handkerchief is the idea that William Hurt may be ready for his Jeff Bridges moment.
0.75 <|###|> The unhurried direction of Udayan Prasad and the unafraid choices of the sure-footed cast keep this character-driven drama afloat.
0.75 <|###|> The Yellow Handkerchief is a love story. Two, really. At its center is the sweetly fractured ticking of a broken heart on the mend.
0.625 <|###|> The story arc of Handkerchief is entirely predictable, and the direction is pedestrian. But its pleasures are to be found in the graceful acting of Hurt and Bello...
0.75 <|###|> This modest but moving indie ensemble piece puts three estimable actors in a convertible, sets them on a long drive to post-Katrina Louisiana and lets the character dynamics do the rest.
0.75 <|###|> The Yellow Handkerchief is a surprisingly moving drama -- a throwback to the small, character-driven indies of yesteryear.
0.75 <|###|> Even Stewart, an untutored colt of an actress who can toggle between natural grace and utter haplessness, finds her groove here.
0.75 <|###|> You don't need an original story for a movie. You need original characters and living dialogue.
0.375 <|###|> Sluggish. Torpid. Boring.
0.5 <|###|> Prasad's take on the well-traveled folk tale (it didn't originate with Hamill -- he was just smart enough to put it down on paper) won't win any Oscars...
0.625 <|###|> The sleepy scenery and charming performances -- Stewart escapes her vampires and reminds everyone what the fuss used to be about -- keep The Yellow Handkerchief from blowing it.
0.75 <|###|> With tired eyes, a hesitant stoop and thinning hair, William Hurt makes only occasional appearances in films these days, but he's forgotten nothing about the kind of niche acting that informed his early work and won him a coveted Best Actor Oscar.
0.8 <|###|> Kristen Stewart, just 17 at the time the movie was shot (several months before filming began on the first "Twilight" picture), navigates the swells of teenage confusion with precocious confidence.
0.5 <|###|> Director Udayan Prasad knows how to maximize tight spaces and closed-up characters, but Stewart underwhelms with her churlish pout and Southern twang, while Redmayne is simply annoying.
0.6 <|###|> The romantic drama earns solid marks for atmosphere, moving shots of post-Katrina New Orleans and acting-few do sad-and-wise better than William Hurt-but each theme is hit a bit too hard and predictably.
0.8 <|###|> Subtly powerful road trip film OK for most teens.
0.8 <|###|> A road movie about three travelers in post-Katrina Louisiana and their quest to avoid a bleak and dark future.
0.875 <|###|> Erin Dignam's episodic script, brimming with humor and honest emotion -- and the pitch-perfect direction of Udayan Prasad -- thankfully avoids manipulating the audience at every turn.
0.7 <|###|> William Hurt, who specializes in playing high-strung, upscale neurotics, brings his formidable skills to The Yellow Handkerchief.
0.7 <|###|> a refreshingly dimensional four-character ensemble piece
0.5 <|###|> Well-shot and well-acted, but also so consistently lightweight that it risks disappearing from the screen as you watch it.
0.4 <|###|> A wispy story of revelation that's blessed with gorgeously photographed Southern discomfort, and beset by on-the-nose dialogue and awkward time-shifting.
0.5 <|###|> The film fails to provide Kristen Stewart the courtesy of a role with scene-stealing potential.
0.8 <|###|> [Arthur] Cohn has assembled a quartet of gifted actors who are captivating under Prasad's perceptive direction.
0.6 <|###|> Yellow Handkerchief is just another quiet character piece that may make its way to theaters in limited release, but won't cause any waves.
0.2 <|###|> Boring fight movie. Wayne Newton is okay, but nothing exciting here.
0.4 <|###|> A major studio actually backed this sequel?
0.3 <|###|> Even as far as this style of junk goes ... "Best of the Best 2" is pretty darn bad.
0.53 <|###|> If ever there was a more beautiful yet less funny comedy than Harry and Walter Go to New York, I'd like to see it. Or maybe I wouldn't.
0.6 <|###|> Lots of fun....sexy, slick and surprisingly novel
1.0 <|###|> Thrilling, touching adventure for animal lovers.
0.8 <|###|> A lovely and unjustly forgotten family film.
0.6 <|###|> Somehow makes the story of orphaned geese entertaining.
0.8 <|###|> Story of a girl and her geese is complex entertainment for kids and grown-ups.
0.875 <|###|> From bumbling infants to majestic adults, a flock hasn't been this charismatic onscreen since Hitchcock went bird-watching.
0.8 <|###|> It's a genuine delight and a definite thumbs aloft for kids of about six upwards.
0.6 <|###|> Beautiful looking and well acted, but lacking in the kind of tension that marks a well-told tale.
0.5 <|###|> To its credit, The Best Two Years shows a refreshing willingness to acknowledge the foibles and possible problems with some Mormon missionary practices.
0.75 <|###|> The film is excellent and very informative to non-Mormons. I worked with several in the past and always wondered about this two-year voluntary mission. Its great!
0.6 <|###|> An earnest and impressively polished attempt at providing an inside look at the experiences of full-time Mormon missionaries.
0.5 <|###|> [Anderson] handles the frat-house humor more convincingly than he does the conversion scenes, which are so serious and emotional that they seem to come from a different movie.
0.5 <|###|> Earnest but bland depiction of Mormon missionaries as normal guys, even if they do live within the drug-, alcohol- and sex-free context of an old TV series.
0.75 <|###|> The value of The Best Two Years is its wholesome, sometimes humorous view, of missionary life.
0.7 <|###|> If you see one Mormon movie in your life (and really, to expose yourself to a different point of view, you ought to see one), this is the one to see.
0.4 <|###|> After seeing The Best Two Years, you might want to stop by a construction site to see which is more interesting, this movie or watching paint dry.
0.75 <|###|> There is enough humanistic truth here, though, to fascinate and entertain non-believers.
0.75 <|###|> ...the story is a solid one and well worth your time to see.
0.75 <|###|> Not only does this surprisingly warm and funny -- and well-acted -- comedy-drama stand head and shoulders above the most recent crop of LDS features, it's a film that may appeal to moviegoers outside its obvious target audience.
0.75 <|###|> The movie proves that Mormon Cinema, even on a small budget, can play in the big leagues.
0.75 <|###|> Jon Favreau's charismatic and convincing performance as the boxing legend is enough to recommend this biopic.
0.4 <|###|> Rocky Marciano was a knockout of a fighter to say the least. It's too bad Winkler's movie about him carries no particular punch
0.2 <|###|> Torturous vampire bloodbath is a waste for all.
0.3 <|###|> A tedious Blade rip-off. No suspense or scares, but lots of boredom.
0.4 <|###|> While Rise: Blood Hunter isn't a terrible film, it's a predictable one.
0.7 <|###|> far from perfect, but it's better than most direct-to-video horror you'll find out there. Heck, it's better than some of the theatrical releases we've seen this year
0.75 <|###|> ...a far more effective piece of work than one might've expected...
0.4 <|###|> It's a blood-red affair thrown together in a dash, a little number that will ultimately get the same kind of treatment from audiences as it did from those who made it: something you might cue up in the DVD player on a whim and forget just as easily.
0.5 <|###|> A dry and dreary little affair, one that's almost shamefully beholden to B-flicks that are a lot more energetic and a lot less intent on being taken so seriously.
0.25 <|###|> Many scenes are set in dark parking lots and dirty city streets, but you sense the locations were chosen because they were inexpensive. There is some pleasure to be had counting continuity mistakes.
0.625 <|###|> [Director] Gutierrez sustains a heightened mood of sex and violence that, without breaking new ground, entertains in the way Gothic flicks do: a combination of cheap thrills and a good old-fashioned crusade against evil.
0.625 <|###|> You can thank a capable cast led by the estimable Lucy Liu, and work by writer/director Sebastian Gutierrez that succeeds in making the formulaic seem fresh.
0.2 <|###|> There are worse things than waking up in a morgue. Like, say, waking up and realizing there's another hour of Rise: Blood Hunter to go.
0.2 <|###|> Like KISS's music, it's juvenile, crass, bombastic, and loud.
0.4 <|###|> A valentine to sex, drugs, and cutting school.
0.375 <|###|> What works for rocking and rolling all night (and partying every day) doesn't necessarily hold true for movies.
0.8 <|###|> The movie isn't a trailblazer; it's an exuberantly trashy party, a comedy of lowdown defeats and triumphs.
0.5 <|###|> A nice, respective try, but Detroit Rock City just misses the mark.
0.375 <|###|> Look, that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver. Twice. See? Funny!
0.625 <|###|> Surprisingly amiable for a film that claims to 'kiss the rules goodbye.'
0.625 <|###|> high energy farce
0.625 <|###|> Set in the 1970's and produced by Gene Simmons (among others), this scrawny little script eventually becomes a rich film.
0.75 <|###|> The hit-and-run effect sometimes suggests a documentary equivalent to slam dancing, but without the bruises.
0.84 <|###|> AmericanHardcore ! Aboutboredstupidyouth! Didn'tliketheNewWave ! Gomoshin'fortruth ! Can'tfindtruth ! Can'tfindgrace ! SettleforHenryRollins! Punchin'dudesintheface !
0.625 <|###|> While this documentary features rare performance footage of hard-core punk-rock bands Black Flag and Bad Brains, it's not exactly the best-assembled or deepest cinematic exploration of the subject.
0.7 <|###|> ... an enjoyable if incomplete nostalgia trip.
0.75 <|###|> Rachman's concert footage confirms that the music was unique: bruising, chaotic and blisteringly electric.
0.75 <|###|> "American Hardcore" harkens back to the time when punk rockers were actual punks, not whining, prefabricated MTV pretty boys.
0.75 <|###|> Crammed with grainy, shot-on-the-fly mid-Eighties video footage, recent interviews, and a genuine love for its subject, American Hardcore encapsulates a largely forgotten moment in maximum rock & roll history.
0.75 <|###|> American Hardcore, Paul Rachman's impressively thorough documentary, tells of the second-generation punk rockers who learned from the Sex Pistols and Ramones and then did their DIY thing.
0.75 <|###|> American Hardcore gets what most music lovers could not at the time: Sometimes, that noise in your head and that anger in your heart just has to get out, and there's always a guitar around somewhere.
0.5 <|###|> For the record, Rachman's punk-rockology has its cracks. While he worships at the altar of Henry Rollins and Black Flag, he excludes such key West Coast bands as X and the Dead Kennedys.
0.5 <|###|> Instead of an insightful look at disaffected youths finding an outlet for angry energy in rock rages, American Hardcore is a slanted history lesson coming solely from its subjects.
0.5 <|###|> What's irritating about the movie is how much time it spends on empty nostalgia -- shouldn't real punks scorn reminiscing? -- and how little time it spends truly exploring the roots of America's punk prime in the early 1980s.
0.5 <|###|> Hardcore could have done with a little more self-criticism instead of self-congratulation, a little more outside commentary as opposed to inner-circle ramblings.
0.625 <|###|> Leaves little doubt that this truly was one of the wildest eras in rock.
0.5 <|###|> You can come away feeling bruised and half-deaf.
0.75 <|###|> An energetic and grandly entertaining tribute to a short-lived period of early-'80s punk rock.
0.625 <|###|> The movie is hazy about dates and names but bracing in its depiction of young people who made music because they loved it, not because they thought it would make them rich or famous.
0.625 <|###|> Exhaustive and at turns exhausting, American Hardcore explores 1980s punk subculture with the frenetic energy of mile-a-minute mosh-pit music, sealed with a fist.
0.625 <|###|> A better doc about punk music would contextualize the genre in the industry and interview kids who cried 'No!' when their parents told them to turn down that racket.
0.625 <|###|> A reverential but knowledgeable documentary about an aggressive offshoot of punk that flourished on the Left Coast from 1980-86, with outposts in such far-flung locales as Washington, D.C., New York, Boston, Detroit, Chicago and Austin, Tex.
0.5 <|###|> There's a lot of interesting material here, but Rachman doesn't offer any real analysis of his own, and the film suffers from a lack of narrative focus.
0.8 <|###|> A brilliant grassroots take on the humble beginnings and eventual demise of a musical movement that ultimately had far more impact than it would have ever imagined.
0.625 <|###|> The film's a pretty good scrapbook ... and it evinces a healthy cranky-old-man disgust with the mega-platinum punk acts of today.
0.625 <|###|> If you're going to make a movie about hardcore punk, make a movie about hardcore punk.... [This] looks more like the same old PBS documentary.
0.625 <|###|> Though American Hardcore doesn't achieve a cogent and authoritative history, it succeeds in giving the general impression of the early-'80s hardcore punk scene.
0.625 <|###|> ... starts promisingly but quickly settles into a repetitive pattern of talking heads repeating the same mantra, interspersed with brief clips of barely visible old film footage.
0.7 <|###|> This is the 80's like you have never seen them, brilliantly brought back to life in this fascinating new film.
0.48 <|###|> Only if you LOVE hardcore punk is the movie worth a damn
0.75 <|###|> Almost anyone who's had enough of the purposeless, processed pop that passes for entertainment today will nod their heads in emphatic agreement with what the film says -- when you're not covering your ears, anyway.
0.6 <|###|> The documentary is an enlightening journey to a dark corner of contemporary punk's dank little basement.
0.625 <|###|> If it all goes by too fast, and leaves you with a headache when it's done -- well, wasn't that the point all along?
0.5 <|###|> The film features virtually no commentary from anyone who wasn't part of the original scene and who might put hardcore into a larger cultural context, and ends up an intermittently interesting laundry list of same-sounding bands.
0.75 <|###|> It's an expansive look at a genre and a tribe of musicians that found their collective voice. And there's one thing you could always say about hardcore -- it was never boring.
0.75 <|###|> Inspired by a book by Steven Blush, Rachman deftly sketches the hardcore scene in a dozen cities and chronicles the growing violence that signaled its demise.
0.6 <|###|> The resourceful film will stir up a mosh pit of appreciation among aficionados while providing an intriguing, if not always compelling, overview for those less acquainted with the music.
0.75 <|###|> Punk rock was never about sonic perfection: It was (and is) about emotional intensity, and American Hardcore has that in van loads, and delivers with onetwothreefour! power.
0.3 <|###|> For music that is loud, fast, angry, and in-your-face, the film's low-key tone and pace is more suitable for a PBS fund-raising drive.
0.7 <|###|> tells you everything you need to know about how vital this music was
0.625 <|###|> Every bit as cornball as it sounds.
1.0 <|###|> If you have been with Jesse and Celine through the twists and turns, slips and stumbles of their romantic journey then their long, flowing, deceptively gripping conversations ripple with the realities of life.
1.0 <|###|> Maybe we'll see more of them in another nine years. But if not, if things end here in this perfect trilogy, then that's enough to consider it as perhaps the greatest cinematic love story of all time.
0.9 <|###|> The movie's funny at times and difficult at others, and ends absolutely perfectly. The best of the three.
0.8 <|###|> Delpy and Hawke talk and talk and talk but it is all fascinating.
0.875 <|###|> Like the Up series, a return to visit old friends
0.875 <|###|> Making a movie with nothing more than smart dialogue and fine performances is a dying art, but Linklater, Hawke and Delpy remind us that it's a skill worth saving.
0.9 <|###|> Before Midnight feels like the natural extension of the series, and will be everything fans of it could have hoped for.
0.6 <|###|> The trouble with those first two film was their souffle-light scenarios...Here, however, things are much juicier as infidelity, commitment, divorce, resentment and all the other soul-sapping things that clock in when you hit your 40s come into play.
0.88 <|###|> ...in the surprising third act, the film comes together as a plausible horror show of how good intentions and real affection can give way to vicious, realistic psychic combat. (
0.75 <|###|> ...Before Midnight bears too few similarities to its thoroughly superior predecessors.
0.8 <|###|> The release of each sequel is becoming an event, so it's particularly great to see Before Midnight not only meeting expectations but raising the bar.
0.625 <|###|> Before Midnight is no romance. It's a horror movie.
0.8 <|###|> Takes its traditional romantic tale into more insightful territories.
0.8 <|###|> Hawk and Delpy know just how to get under your skin. Their onscreen alter egos fit like a glove, and witnessing their ageing, nagging, toying love is a true privilege.
1.0 <|###|> What lifts Linklater's trilogy above your average dialogue-heavy indie is not just the intelligence of the conversation but its frankness and humor.
0.9 <|###|> The 'Before' trilogy is a vacation for me. I am taken away, and it is never for long enough. I genuinely feel lucky to have these movies.
1.0 <|###|> I'm not sure this is the end of Richard Linklater's 'Before' trilogy. It's perfection just as it is, but then again, Linklater has nine more years to work on the sequel.
0.875 <|###|> Loving words mix with personal attacks, the magic moments with the unintended slights, as we witness the occasional desperation of imperfect people doing the best they can when life moves beyond meet-cute and courtship. That's authentic.
0.8 <|###|> Linklater and his players bring an end to the fantasy and welcome the thrilling ups and bitter downs of reality to this love story.
0.8 <|###|> The duo, clearly so comfortable in their characters' skin, indulge in intelligent banter, sharp humour and emotional truths.
1.0 <|###|> So much better written than contemporary novels, this film is a literary as well as cinematic achievement to cherish. For grown-ups.
1.0 <|###|> None of the films is faultless in itself, but, tinted with complementary tones, the complete cycle comes as close to perfection as any trilogy in cinema history.
0.8 <|###|> It's been 18 years since Hawke, Delpy and Linklater introduced us to Jesse and Celine, and their story just gets richer, funnier and more punchy each time we see them. In 1995's Before Sunrise, they were idealistic 23-year-olds.
0.6 <|###|> Hawke and Delpy are as believably real as any screen couple can ever be.
0.8 <|###|> This is one of the few sequels for which the cliche 'eagerly awaited' is truly applicable.
0.8 <|###|> Predictably, it's just as great as the first two.
0.6 <|###|> By the end, Before Midnight inches towards a dawn of charm. But it's a troubled trip.
1.0 <|###|> As an organic experiment in collaboration between actors and director, it is a triumph, co-created and co-owned by Delpy, Linklater and Hawke.
1.0 <|###|> Hawke and Delpy, who are both credited on the script too, have never found co-stars to bounce off more nimbly or bring out richer nuances in their acting.
0.8 <|###|> The performances and dialogue are wonderfully naturalistic; a reminder that the best special effects are often the cheapest.
0.875 <|###|> Before Midnight is about the nature of long-term relationships, and the way love deepens and grows but also finds itself subject to the complications of maturity. Smart, insightful, and poignant.
0.8 <|###|> For those who witnessed Jesse and Celine's tentative getting together as inter railing students almost twenty years ago, it's reassuring to see them still in love.
1.0 <|###|> Brilliantly directed, superbly written and impeccably acted, this is a thoroughly enjoyable, thought-provoking and emotionally engaging drama that perfectly complements the previous two films.
0.8 <|###|> It remains as engaging, illuminating, honest and funny as its predecessor; here's hoping we revisit Jesse and Celine in another decade or so.
1.0 <|###|> It will offend those who are offended by the very title; it will probably thrill those who take one look at the title and immediately want to see the film.
0.7 <|###|> The results are uneven and occasionally mind-bogglingly bad (which is partly the point), but they're never what you'd call dull.
0.7 <|###|> And what, pray tell, is the Big JC doing wasting his time helping Canadians?
0.8 <|###|> The basic premise alone is worth the price of admission for this one.
0.8 <|###|> This dark coming-of-age story is a unique romp.
0.75 <|###|> Harris and Phifer's chemistry lends the inevitable tragedies some genuine punch.
0.8 <|###|> "Paid In Full" is not the kind of movie that George W. Bush will ever see.
0.75 <|###|> Stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation.
0.6 <|###|> For a rapsploitation film to target and frown upon the darker forces of its nature is certainly a good sign for the maturation of the genre.
0.4 <|###|> The story is familiar from its many predecessors; like them, it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay.
0.625 <|###|> If you saw it on TV, you'd probably turn it off, convinced that you had already seen that movie.
0.75 <|###|> This familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences, though it's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times.
0.375 <|###|> Harris is supposed to be the star of the story, but comes across as pretty dull and wooden.
0.5 <|###|> A standard, run-of-the-mill drug drama.
0.5 <|###|> Needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance.
0.375 <|###|> Bottom-rung New Jack City wannabe.
0.625 <|###|> Rings true, from the smooth dialogue to the unaffected performances of the central actors.
0.625 <|###|> The movie is ambitious, has good energy and is well-acted, but tells a familiar story in a familiar way.
0.5 <|###|> In this bird's-eye-view of the drug trade circa 1986, there's something missing: the buyers.
0.5 <|###|> A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood, this movie strives to be more, but doesn't quite get there. Good performances keep it from being a total rehash.
0.6 <|###|> Bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness.
0.7 <|###|> Instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western, it's an unpretentious, sociologically pointed slice of life.
0.6 <|###|> Suffers from a flat script and a low budget.
0.4 <|###|> It's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick.
0.75 <|###|> An intelligent crime drama, not because of the criminal activity it dramatizes but because of its powerful examination of the forces that drive criminals.
0.75 <|###|> Though filmed partly in Canada, Paid in Full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the Reagan years.
0.75 <|###|> It's good, hard-edged stuff, violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done, morally alert and street-smart.
0.75 <|###|> ...does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters' choices, good and ill, that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought.
0.625 <|###|> Paid in Full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of Goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks.
0.6 <|###|> Uneven script, but strong performances by a powerhouse cast.
0.6 <|###|> A strained but nevertheless involving little personal drama about a delinquent's alleged murderous deed. Schroeder's suspense piece is arbitrary but satisfying thanks to the reliable leads.
0.5 <|###|> Despite Meryl Streep, Liam Neeson and the usually estimable Edward Furlong, this nonevent huffs and puffs to attain even the level of an ordinary motion picture.
0.5 <|###|> fares poorly when constrained to the screen
0.4 <|###|> If you can't make me petrified of a place called the "Suicide Forest," you've got some explaining to do.
1.0 <|###|> A slight yet profound exploration of generational choices and our fear of living our parents' lives.
0.8 <|###|> Sweet and fiercely humane, Song's layered family portrait is decidedly Buddhist: silent when it needs to be and steadfast about approaching inevitable tragedy with care and patience.
0.625 <|###|> Death hangs over Song Fang's first feature, Memories Look at Me, but it's neither with grimness nor overt tragedy.
0.75 <|###|> Watching Memories's like listening to the secrets of this family's history.
0.8 <|###|> Muscular if overwrought drama with great performances.
0.7 <|###|> Loose, rambling and sometimes rudderless as it is, "The Indian Runner" has a fundamental honesty that gives it real substance.
0.75 <|###|> Penn surrounds his brothers with supporting characters who are so well-realized, I'll remember them as long as I remember the leads.
1.0 <|###|> There has never been a picture like David O. Selznick's production of Gone With the Wind.
1.0 <|###|> Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh create their own sizzle as Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara in a lavish four-hour epic that juxtaposes scenes of jaw-dropping majesty with moments of elegant intimacy and playful verbal jousting.
0.8 <|###|> No one watches Gone with the Wind for historical accuracy. What keeps us coming back is four-hours of epic romance in gorgeous Technicolor.
0.6 <|###|> Too clumsy a thing to be taken seriously, with its romanticisation of slavery and its problematic approach to rape, Gone With The Wind is nevertheless a work of considerable power.
1.0 <|###|> Running to nearly four hours and boasting at least three directors, this epic American Civil War romantic drama is more of a symbol of the Hollywood studio system than a mere movie.
0.6 <|###|> The performances of eternally glittering movie stars Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable ... exist in a league of their own, demanding rapt attention in scene after scene.
1.0 <|###|> Ginormous in both scale and emotional wallop, MGM's epic is still a cinematic event to be savoured.
1.0 <|###|> Brimming with colour and passion, it pulls its emotional kick from tremendous performances, not least from Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable as the love-hate lovers.
0.68 <|###|> The golden standard for classic Hollywood bombast, this one.
0.6 <|###|> If ever the phrase, "They don't make 'em like they used to" could fit a film, this is it.
0.8 <|###|> The epic film that to this day stands as the benchmark against which all other epics are judged.
1.0 <|###|> Gone with the Wind is still dated, but it's a dynamite kind of antiquity.
1.0 <|###|> It's impossible not to be carried away by the rich arterial force of this storytelling.
1.0 <|###|> Grand old Hollywood at its most magnificent and melodramatic. Say what you like about the soapy characterisation and plotting, the spectacle flattens all in its wake.
1.0 <|###|> A lost Hollywood art: the epic melodrama.
1.0 <|###|> Terrificly acted, staged and designed, Gone WIth the Wind remains one of the greatest period epics ever filmed.
0.875 <|###|> Despite the star power of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, Wind has lost some of its bluster, yet it survives as a glorious Technicolored window into America's dusty, bygone past.
1.0 <|###|> It's so full of iconic moments of plotting and dialog that a feature film could be edited just out of the most quotable moments.
1.0 <|###|> ...producer David O. Selznick's crowning achievement and a film that stands up as one of the screen's finest classics.
1.0 <|###|> One of the classic films that defined American cinema, Gone With the Wind is a rare example of a collaboration involving hundreds of talents and egos that turned out great.
1.0 <|###|> Never, never bores me. Glabe is fabulous!
0.75 <|###|> Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara remain the greatest pairing of irresistible force and immovable object in Hollywood romance.
1.0 <|###|> Treat yourself to one of the greatest cinematic experiences ever created.
1.0 <|###|> The brilliant epitome of corporate filmmaking.
1.0 <|###|> Often, older movies are a bit naive and unthreatening, but this movie is surprisingly fierce and somber.
1.0 <|###|> Mind-boggling for the first time in a theater. Too bad that many, like me, see it first on TV.
1.0 <|###|> It could be -- and should be -- viewed from a dozen different perspectives, but it is, above all, a story about adapting to the most challenging circumstances possible.
1.0 <|###|> Clear an evening and indulge yourself in one of the few films that can justifiably be called an epic.
1.0 <|###|> The best remembered and most publicized film in Hollywood's flamboyant history, the biggest of David O. Selznick's grand obsessions, and quite probably the most beloved movie of all time.
1.0 <|###|> The passionate saga of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, played out against the flaming red backdrop of the Civil War, generates enough romance, historic drama and deep emotion to fuel a dozen great films.
0.91 <|###|> Everything about it is big.
0.9 <|###|> Victor Fleming's 60-year-old movie looks like it was shot this year.
0.75 <|###|> What it loses in novelty and subtlety it makes up for in its earnest depiction of love and individual human decency in the face of societal cruelty.
0.75 <|###|> Dealing with the Balkan wars, this ambitious and compassionate art film interweaves three stories (one set in London) that contrast the calm beauty of the Macedonian landscape with the harowing violence that erups within its borders.
0.6 <|###|> Unfortunately not the masterpiece I hoped for, but still a thought-provoking trio of intertwined stories set in the war-torn Balkans.
1.0 <|###|> Impecable.
0.8 <|###|> Sebring's drifting tone might leave you bemused, but take it as it comes and it's a captivating insight into modern music's godmother.
0.3333333333333333 <|###|> For all its transient black-and-white beauties, denies its subject the sort of solid context that would reveal the scale of her achievements. A patchy, frustrating, though loving tribute.
0.7 <|###|> An extraordinarily intimate portrait of an extraordinary woman, Dream of Life charms despite being filmed through a sycophantic haze.
0.8 <|###|> While it fails to place Smith's work and her significance in context, the film certainly captures her charisma, wit and passion.
0.6 <|###|> There are flashes of insight and genuinely moving moments in this long, meandering, wildly indulgent movie record of poet and singer-songwriter Patti Smith.
0.6 <|###|> Smith, an eloquent subject with a wry view on her life, generously pays tribute to such influential mentors as Dylan, Burroughs and Ginsberg. Her fans should be entranced.
0.4 <|###|> Succeeds in making the 109 minute running time feel like at least eight of the eleven years he took to shoot the film.
0.75 <|###|> That spirit of encountering the world with undying artistic curiosity -- and without a plan -- informs Dream of Life, a drifting portrait of Smith.
0.5 <|###|> If you don't already own "Horses," this movie will make you want to go out and buy it. You'll also want to start surfing the Internet to fill in the blanks that Dream of Life fails to include.
0.8 <|###|> There's a note of mourning in this otherwise celebratory film -- for punk rock, for New York, for reality, for a time when popular music was animated by something other than money.
0.625 <|###|> Heavy on the gabba-gabba, light on the hey!
0.75 <|###|> Gets extra credit for trying something different.
0.75 <|###|> Dream of Life barely hints at the transformational energy that Smith exudes in person, but it does paint a portrait of a defiantly creative life.
0.7 <|###|> Dream of Life takes a while to find its rhythm but once it does, it's riveting stuff.
0.75 <|###|> Patti Smith: Dream of Life, fashion photographer Steven Sebring's impressionistic study of the most influential of punk poets, disarms and charms with its honesty.
0.6 <|###|> Insufferable, endearing, pretentiously arty, bracingly direct, humorless, hilarious, oddly distant and strangely touching, but always compulsively watchable -- in other words, a fabulous contradictory mess, much like Smith herself.
0.625 <|###|> Thanks to its meandering, achronological structure, we don't learn too many specifics of Smith's brilliant career, and only a die-hard fan will find all of it vitally interesting.
0.75 <|###|> I imagine you could call Dream of Life a loving meditation on a one-of-a-kind performer. And you don't have to be a Smith fan (I am one, by the way) to enjoy.
0.6 <|###|> Few documentaries about living artists get as deep into their subject's brain and heart as this one about the rock priestess and poetess.
0.5 <|###|> The opportunity to introduce newbies to a serious music-world icon -- and her significance -- feels squandered.
0.625 <|###|> Even the crudest punk rocker learned three chords (Smith brags of having five) before they plugged in an amp. Steven Sebring would have done better to have had a few lessons in editing and structure before picking up his camera.
0.75 <|###|> Probably could have cut out 15 to 20 minutes without losing anything, but if you're even remotely interested in this fascinating and enigmatic artist or the influence she's had on the world of rock, then you might want to check it out.
0.8 <|###|> A lovely, drifty first feature that feels less like a documentary and more like an act of rapturous devotion.
0.5 <|###|> a schizophrenic case study
0.75 <|###|> A series of elegiac episodes from the life and mind of the fantabulous rock n' roll chanteuse and poetess.
0.7 <|###|> Ostensibly a courtroom drama, Black or White is actually one of the most sensitive and intelligent introspections of American race relations in quite some time.
0.4 <|###|> Although the script lacks nuance or any real tension, Binder uses Costner effectively.
0.5 <|###|> It isn't enough that the movie's heart and soul are in the right place. It needed edge and art to throw a punch.
0.4 <|###|> Not the film America deserves, and it is also not the film America needs. But we got it anyway.
0.6 <|###|> The script, written by director Binder, tries to say too much, and in doing so, loses some of its charm.
0.5 <|###|> We are left with a movie that raises more questions that it satisfactorily addresses.
0.625 <|###|> Sorting through prejudices and nuances of racial perception occasionally takes Black or White into intriguing territory...[more often] a rather mushily obvious, TV-movie-style courtroom drama built on straw-man arguments.
0.4 <|###|> A family drama that shies away from any serious examination of racism in America
0.45 <|###|> A movie that means well but lacks the conviction and cultural awareness necessary for anything substantial.
0.6 <|###|> Great cast reveals rough and sentimental journey; Jillian Estel as Eloise is amazing
0.2 <|###|> Binder's script is a big-screen soap opera, which he attempts to offset with often out-of-place humor.
0.6 <|###|> Another subtle reminder of how much racial bigotry matters...
0.7 <|###|> For the first two acts, Mike Binder casts an honest look at these characters' pride and prejudices. Too bad its last act hinges more on incident and surprise than illumination or self-reflection. It mars an otherwise admirably tough-minded drama.
0.4 <|###|> Its heart may be in the right place but the film's script lacks the nuance and subtlety that could really elevate this drama.
0.625 <|###|> Kevin Costner's and Octavia Spencer's confrontational scenes are "Black or White's" strong suits.
0.625 <|###|> Oh, the bathos! The loony wrongheadedness of the screenplay!
0.6 <|###|> It's far from ground-breaking in its social statements, but Black or White is still a solid comedy/drama buoyed by good performances all around.
0.5 <|###|> A discussion is better than none, but the conversation can be improved.
0.5 <|###|> Black Or White asks the right questions, but never gets around to answering them, instead finding itself caught up in stereotypes and cutesy storytelling that often feels like a Hallmark message.
0.75 <|###|> Black or White is far from perfect, but it's an ideal way to kick off a healthy discussion on race in America.
0.4 <|###|> Even when well-intentioned - which I believe this movie is - broad, sweeping, can't-we-all-just-get-along moralizing only opens the door for cringe-worthy moments, which this movie has plenty of.
0.6 <|###|> Binder tackles some very tough material here in a very thoughtful way, even if it falls a little off-balance.
0.3 <|###|> Black or White seems manufactured to show why an alcoholic white man is always better than triflin' ass black people.
0.375 <|###|> Kevin Costner scowls and darts around the dubious thin line between "racism" and un-sugarcoated "truthfulness" that only anti-P.C. wingnuts actually believe exists.
0.625 <|###|> Despite the best of intentions, a career-best performance from Kevin Costner, and outstanding work by Octavia Spencer and child actor Jillian Estell, "Black or White" succumbs to some of the same stereotypes it tries to dispel.
0.75 <|###|> Black Or White is a good movie constantly fluctuating back and forth from clunky to complex.
0.75 <|###|> It may be helpful - or vexing - to think of "Black or White" as the great grandchild of "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"
0.625 <|###|> It's often painful, and not in a good way; it's painful because of the roads it doesn't explore, the shortcuts it takes, and the special pleading it can't stop itself from indulging in.
0.5 <|###|> No one seems to want to talk about [race], so Binder finds ways to force them to. Every time, those methods feel forced and unearned.
0.6 <|###|> Sometimes flawed material can be saved by great performances and good intentions.
0.625 <|###|> The film is by no means perfect and its goals are undermined by a sloppy climax and conclusion but it avoids preaching while providing fodder for thought.
0.5 <|###|> Kevin Costner gives everything he's got to the role, but writer-director Mike Binder, who worked beautifully with Costner on 2005's The Upside of Anger, finds himself on the downside of juggling stereotypes.
0.5 <|###|> The title suggests there are no easy answers. So why does everything feel so tidy?
0.875 <|###|> Epic, intimate and gripping.
0.71 <|###|> The mountaineers climb for reasons that have little to do with nationalism - reasons the film clumsily attempts to articulate in words. It's far more successful conveying those inspirations with stunning images of them scaling daunting heights.
0.6 <|###|> It's Kolja Brandt's gloriously edge-of-the-seat/seat-of-the-pants cinematography (much of the film was shot on location) that really packs a natural wallop.
0.6 <|###|> The images of the Eiger are both majestic and harrowing, and the action is as exciting as in any mountain-climbing movie to date.
0.8 <|###|> I have no idea if anything beyond the essentials is accurate. A good deal of it feels more like a 1930s movie than a 1930s event
0.875 <|###|> A straightforward, wickedly suspenseful Man vs. Nature saga of the type that rarely gets made any more.
0.625 <|###|> Philipp Stolzl worked in the same dangerous conditions as the original climbers, and we can feel the chill and peril in our bones. It's a shame, then, that the screenwriter, unlike the camera crew and the characters, was afflicted with such timidity.
0.75 <|###|> There's no subtext and not much character development, but those aren't really missed.
0.625 <|###|> The romantic subplot is underwritten and overwrought. More compelling is ... the impressively harrowing mountain footage.
0.5 <|###|> Some of the plotting (credited to four screenwriters) is too conventional and convenient, and the clunky running time is a problem - two-plus hours of this material is too much.
0.6 <|###|> With knuckles alternately white from suspense and black from frostbite, the alpinists get progressively harder to tell apart. But the most compelling character, for all its brutal enormity, always was the mountain.
0.75 <|###|> The word "gripping" doesn't do it justice.
0.875 <|###|> This white-knuckle adventure is a literal and metaphoric cliff-hanger that gets a spectacular foothold on an unforgiving mountain.
0.75 <|###|> Some of the shots must have been made on sets. None of that matters. I was on the side of that mountain all the way.
0.625 <|###|> Most of the action is set on the Eiger's north face, and because this true story is not well known in this country, I was gripped by the very real surprises that occurred there.
0.7 <|###|> Although about 30 minutes too long, it is still interesting with phenomenal cinematography. It's an exhausting sit, but bring your parka.
0.75 <|###|> The film puts us on the cruelly beautiful mountain alongside the climbers as they inch up treacherous limestone crags and unstable ice fields. The fear of falling is palpable.
0.625 <|###|> Five writers were responsible for the script, and the characters consequently have one or two generic characteristics and no inner life of their own; they've been committeed to death.
0.75 <|###|> You don't have to be a Nazi to be totally mesmerized by the intense drama on the Eiger: the nimble ascent, the calamities that befall our noble climbers, and the pitiable disasters.
0.625 <|###|> Kolja Brandt's cinematography is stunning, but can't rescue the end from some wince-inducing "Ain't no mountain high enough" heroics.
0.875 <|###|> Stolzl makes the smallest details loom large.
0.9 <|###|> Ssuspenseful, meticulously crafted, harrowing and thrilling. It's an incredible true story about courage and the power of the human spirit.
0.6 <|###|> It is impossible not to put yourself in the boots of the mountaineers clinging to a sheer, icy rock face during a blizzard that threatens to send them into oblivion.
0.5 <|###|> Kolja Brandt's hand-held cinematography and Philipp Stolzl's direction keep the suspense level high. Unfortunately, somebody decided to insert a superfluous love story involving a completely fabricated female photojournalist.
0.4 <|###|> for all the tension-fraught, high-altitude rappelling and cliffhanging, the screenplay has little to counterweigh its commitment to historical truth
0.6 <|###|> Cleverly playing on the genre's propagandistic ties to the Third Reich, the film reflects the tragic arc of National Socialism in each ominous crevasse and in every grandiloquent gesture.
0.75 <|###|> Slogs through an hour of frequently rote exposition until it hits its riveting groove when the rappelling and piton-hammering take over.
0.8 <|###|> A well-crafted, visceral piece of historical filmmaking.
0.5 <|###|> It's the snow-bound scenery that really steals the show.
0.8 <|###|> Brilliantly shot, utterly convincing footage of young men inching up a vertical rock face proves nerve-racking and a worthy tribute to the true-life bravery of 1930s climbers. It's gripping and fascinating in equal measure.
0.6 <|###|> Stolzl captures the period idealism and propaganda perfectly. The terrific footage of the climb is an almost unendurably tense watch.
0.6 <|###|> Stolzl films their harrowing ordeal out on the "Murderwall" with tremendous skill, but the rest of his movie is lumpen to say the least.
0.375 <|###|> Let's hope Richard Gere never has to make another one this cheesy after his comeback in "Arbitrage."
0.7 <|###|> I may have seen some things coming in the story, but it was nonetheless interesting to watch things play out.
0.625 <|###|> You have to admire Brandt and Haas for taking such a gamble, but unfortunately it doesn't quite pay off.
0.625 <|###|> It is a flawed film, but one that accomplishes what it sets out to do: entertain, if in fits and starts, for an hour and a half.
0.5 <|###|> the ineffectiveness of the final half hour ultimately ensures that The Double ends on a disappointingly anticlimactic note.
0.75 <|###|> The type of professionally assembled star programmer a big studio would once release wide to a decent return in an off-peak season.
0.2 <|###|> With nothing resembling a character worth rooting for, the fact that the plot of The Double just gets sillier and sillier makes it one of the most annoying films of the year.
0.375 <|###|> Brandt's thriller doesn't have much of a connection to the present, let alone reality.
0.25 <|###|> Questionable motives and unbelievable decisions are relatively small potatoes compared with the Sputnik-size plotholes.
0.375 <|###|> Like a stripper who gets naked too quickly, the lukewarm spy thriller "The Double" lays out its big plot twist early in the movie - and soon finds, shivering, that it has nowhere else to go.
0.625 <|###|> The title "The Double" doesn't refer to baseball, but it could. The thriller may not hit it out of the park, but it's a solid double.
0.5 <|###|> When the story starts to fall apart you're left wondering if the film was worth all the money and effort that went into making it.
0.4 <|###|> It's simply not very good.
0.5 <|###|> Here is a movie constructed from basic parts at the Used Screenplay Store, with a character plugged in whenever one is required.
0.4 <|###|> Generic, formulaic fumble, misjudging its revelations and overestimating their impact.
0.125 <|###|> Not only does The Double's outdated theme feel out of leftfield, it's unexplained and without reason.
0.375 <|###|> It soon devolves into a mess of slit throats and competing motives. Everyone, it seems, has a plot - except the screenwriters.
0.25 <|###|> What can you say about a dull spy thriller that gives away its big "secret'' both in its trailer and the film's title?
0.4 <|###|> If these characters ever had a motivation for their extreme behavior, it disappeared in rewrites.
0.3 <|###|> A tedious, impenetrable cat-and-mouse game involving Russian double and triple agents.
0.4 <|###|> There's a sanded-off, textbook creativity to "The Double" that forsakes rich cloak-and-dagger textures for generic twists, hackneyed flashbacks and telegraphed moments of peril.
0.5 <|###|> Despite similarities, this film is several rungs down the ladder from Salt and lacks the charisma of a lead like Angelina Jolie to pull you past nagging silliness.
0.3 <|###|> Movie packaging at its worst.
0.2 <|###|> ...hopelessly silly.
0.4 <|###|> Like a Training Day for spy thrillers, The Double provocatively pairs Gere and Grace as a gray-green odd couple, only to unravel as the double-crossed absurdities pile up and the duo start trading bad Russian accents in a private Mexican standoff.
0.25 <|###|> Rarely has Mr. Gere walked through any movie with so little energy and so much indifference.
0.4 <|###|> Too silly to be confusing and too flaccid to reach potboiler status, the convoluted spy-thriller The Double is a tossed-off theatrical release that lands with a resounding thud.
0.78 <|###|> Some might confuse Zenovich's indictment on the judge as a cop-out in judging Polanski. But the facts remain. There's no further insight into the heinous crime. Nor is there a new judgment to be passed on the man who committed it. Anyone looking for new r
0.8 <|###|> "Zenovich's film is a fair and skillful chronicling of the Roman Polanski case, and a study of how the circumstances of celebrity influence the carrying out of justice in the U.S. It's not an in-depth study of the filmmaker's psychology nor of how his lif
0.8 <|###|> While not apologising for his disgusting behaviour, the film puts Polanski's actions in the context of a turbulent life.
0.875 <|###|> an essential entry in Hollywood's cultural chronicle
1.0 <|###|> Mesmo tendo criado uma narrativa envolvente, coesa e impecavel a ponto de servir como base para os advogados de Polanski solicitarem o arquivamento do caso, este documentario foi ignorado pela Academia. Arre.
0.8 <|###|> This chronicle of Polanski's life, career and legal woes offers an engaging portrait of the artist.
0.875 <|###|> It's the sort of complex story Polanski himself would have excelled at telling, if he weren't busy living it.
0.75 <|###|> Though Marina Zenovich's film deals with the notorious case of the film director who pleaded guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old, the film's real subject is the California legal system turned upside down by celebrity and media pressure.
0.8 <|###|> Meticulously crafted and keenly thought out, the film also serves as a useful historical document. It illuminates its time period, delves into moral hypocrisy and shows the evolution of muck-raking celebrity journalism.
0.5 <|###|> With a subject like Roman Polanski, you don't really need to do much to capture audience interest. But maybe that's the reason Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired doesn't live up to its promise.
0.875 <|###|> Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, a documentary by Marina Zenovich that is also a first-rate work of reportage, makes a forceful case that the whole truth of the matter was never heard in court and Polanski was more sinned against than sinning.
0.625 <|###|> I found myself occasionally enthralled, mainly due to Polanski's haunted presence coming through, even in the form of an absent ghost.
0.5 <|###|> Roman Polanski (The Pianist, Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown) is unquestionably a great filmmaker, but as Marina Zenovich's documentary Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired perhaps unintentionally demonstrates, he's also a creep.
0.7 <|###|> She has achieved extraordinary access to the other still-living players in the case, and they all seem to be in agreement: Polanski is correct in saying the judge played with him as a cat might play with a mouse.
1.0 <|###|> This is a superb picture, sharp, open-minded, wised-up and cinematically accomplished. I wonder if any man could've handled the Polanski enigma with the same ironic intelligence [Marina] Zenovich has.
0.8 <|###|> A clever, contemplative kind of courtroom drama that utilizes the best of Hollywood filmmaking style to tell a story so strange, it must be true.
0.8 <|###|> Using tons of footage and new interviews with the victim and key legal figures -- but not the subject himself -- director Marina Zenovich shows how Polanski's darker urges were matched on a moral level by others involved in the case.
0.7 <|###|> Zenovich has made a feature worthy of its eccentric and reckless central figure at his most cynical and embittered.
0.8 <|###|> None of the interviewees in Marina Zenovich's fascinating documentary manages to make sense of the famous filmmaker's behavior or apparent thinking. But they all have compelling impressions.
0.7 <|###|> An exhaustive and riveting narrative
0.5 <|###|> Its indictment ultimately feels like a secondary issue to Polanski's apparently incontrovertible guilt, which makes him--in this instance--still more victimizer than victim.
0.75 <|###|> Seeks to explore both sides of the endless debate and asks all parties to consider every angle before labeling him as a pedophile or misunderstood genius...
0.9 <|###|> Roman Polanski deserves his badge of dishonor, no question about it. This amazing documentary argues that others need to start sporting one as well.
0.8 <|###|> a great and somewhat Kafkaesque story that Polanski might have enjoyed directing... had it been fiction.
0.7 <|###|> Persuasively demonstrates Polanski was guilty as sin, yet his conviction was a miscarriage of justice.
0.8 <|###|> A subtly intelligent and sharply argued documentary.
0.7 <|###|> Is Polanski a great filmmaker who made a mistake, or a perverted coward who ran from the law instead of facing the music?
0.3 <|###|> I would be amazed to hear even the most ardent Sparks fan defend it as anything more than rubbish.
0.4 <|###|> The Best of Me turns into a half-baked dramatic thriller, with violent confrontations, gunfights, plenty of nasty characters and one big scary action scene.
0.4 <|###|> There's something heavy-handed, even for Sparks, in the telling of the couple's story, particularly when it comes to Dawson's family: they are leering, brutal embodiments of evil who function as handy plot devices.
0.625 <|###|> A rather typical Nicholas Sparks adaptation...
0.4 <|###|> The Best Of Me, like all Sparks' work, would rather kill his characters and leave a beautiful corpse than have them continue a real, scarred relationship.
0.5 <|###|> Dawson is called a "white trash piece of (poo)" by his own daddy, which is rich, because daddy -- a low-rent bayou criminal with a mean dog on a chain, a shanty tramp on his lap and jet-black dye on his hair -- actually is a white trash piece of (poo).
0.4 <|###|> Welcome the latest Nicholas Sparks adaptation: always the same, always a bit different (but mostly the same).
0.6 <|###|> You can sneer, but I don't care - the heart wants what it will, and my heart wants Sparks. So there.
0.3 <|###|> Like a hack tunesmith that keeps rewriting the same melodies over and over again, hoping his legion of fans don't notice the ruse, we've heard this Sparks song before.
0.4 <|###|> The film is a huge letdown due to the script. The third act is so much a nonsensical head scratcher that it takes away the alluring romance fans wanted to walk away with.
0.2 <|###|> The Best of Me is quite possibly the worst Nicholas Sparks adaptation ever committed to film.
0.2 <|###|> The worst Nicholas Sparks film of the nine based on his novels, this is the epitome of disingenuous, manufactured and manipulative. The salt on the wound of an already bleeding heart is that the young adults outshine our artificial "A"-list lovebirds.
0.25 <|###|> "I never thought a movie would make me long for the gritty realism of 'The Notebook.'"
0.4 <|###|> Weepy Nicholas Sparks melodrama is cliche-ridden, violent.
0.75 <|###|> A syrupy, sentimental soap opera tailor-made for fans of the Nicholas Sparks franchise.
0.4 <|###|> It's a very silly film.
0.4 <|###|> Bad boy meets good girl, families get in the way and tragedy follows before the emotionally-contrived ending.
0.25 <|###|> The sunlight is golden, the accent's rural (this one's set in Louisiana), people die, sagacious letters are read aloud.
0.4 <|###|> By the standards of other Sparks productions, this is buoyed up well enough by the cast to float along, and everyone's making the best of a fairly blah job.
0.5 <|###|> At a certain point ... the coincidences and tragic incidents start to pile up at a startling rate and nothing can be taken seriously.
0.2 <|###|> I don't know much about Nicholas Sparks novels but do know movies based on them. They pretty much suck. What makes this one different is sucking at a higher level.
0.4 <|###|> There's a fine line separating a film that puts its own spin on a proven formula and one that becomes a caricature of itself. The Best of Me treads all over that line.
0.2 <|###|> Predictability is The Best of Me's greatest sin. The screenplay might has well have been a game of Mad Libs, where plot devices are lifted straight out of previous Sparks books and shoehorned into this bland narrative.
0.2 <|###|> Cynical and lazy, The Best of Me feels as if it's assembled from parts of other, better weepies.
0.375 <|###|> Interminably long, dragging out its molasses heart through what seem like three different endings.
0.625 <|###|> The Best of Me isn't too bad for the majority of its time-crossing story, which means the movie is better than the majority of movies based upon Sparks' work.
0.4 <|###|> As the drama unfolds the ludicrousness of J Mills Goodloe and Will Fetters's script intensifies and the dramatic punches are more liable to provoke howls of laughter than tears of sadness.
0.5 <|###|> "The Best of Me" is content to remain a by-the-numbers excursion into tough-to-swallow soap opera theatrics. At this point, even Nicholas Sparks himself should know better.
0.3 <|###|> Like traditional pornography, The Best of Me has no purpose other than to get a specific reaction...
0.625 <|###|> We've seen this story told in similar fashion so many times in the past. I only wish we could have had it delivered in a fresher, less cliche-filled package.
0.2 <|###|> Much of the dialogue for this terminally mawkish tearjerker sounds as if it has been taken directly from a Dolly Parton or Whitney Houston song.
0.375 <|###|> The latest gaseous emission from the Sparks melodrama machine.
0.25 <|###|> Even permitting that the movie's setup counts almost by default as one of Nicholas Sparks's more complicated scenarios, that makes his failure to draw up compelling, flawed, human characters all the more conspicuous.
0.375 <|###|> Isn't fate a funny thing? Especially when Nicholas Sparks makes it up.
0.5 <|###|> The Best of Me is not the worst adaptation of Nicholas Sparks, but audiences can certainly choose better.
0.4 <|###|> It has a perverse integrity, playing every winsome stare and I'm-gonna-take-my-shirt-off moment with total sincerity.
0.625 <|###|> the film offers Americans an empathetic glimpse of the country we revolted against all those years ago.
0.875 <|###|> About more than Bosnia: it's about the immigrant experience; it's about tolerance; it's about making a difference; it's about learning to make the best of what one has.
0.75 <|###|> People who actually recall 1942 will more greatly appreciate the waves of nostalgia that bathe this affectionate coming-of-age drama, set on a tiny island off New England.
0.6 <|###|> In the early hijinks phase, the film seems like a dry run for Porky's, but it later gets into the business of fluttering curtains, walks on sandy beaches and longing glances.
1.0 <|###|> "Summer Of '42" is an unforgettable meditation on sexual awakening and loss during WWII.
0.6 <|###|> "Summer of '42" is a memory movie, written, directed and acted with such uncommon good humor that I don't think you'll be put off by its sweet soft-focus, at least until you start analyzing it afterwards.
0.8 <|###|> One of the cinematic coming-of-age stories that started a trend.
0.6 <|###|> Nostalgic coming-into-manhood fantasy.
0.625 <|###|> Nostalgia is used as a distancing device -- to keep us safely insulated from the boy's immediate grief, love, and passion.
0.4 <|###|> Dates very badly indeed
0.79 <|###|> It's apparent in every scene that this is a highly personal film for screenwriter Raucher, and the nostalgia is so palpable that it nearly slides off the screen.
0.7 <|###|> What Van Sant's film does, tremendously well, is make the material foreign again.
0.4 <|###|> Psycho doesn't do much for Van Sant, and he doesn't do much for Psycho.
0.4 <|###|> Vaughn's Norman Bates is much inferior because he lacks the natural neurosis of Anthony Perkins.
0.5 <|###|> The movie doesn't stink. The performances are good, potentially great, especially Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates, but he owns a scene just for doing that psychotic giggle of his.
0.4 <|###|> Personally, I found the remake weaker than the original (which was only vaguely interesting anyway; then again, it's pretty much the same movie).
0.375 <|###|> franky it sucks
0.625 <|###|> Gus Vant Sant has remade Alfred Hitchcock's classic slasher film with so much reverence and so little originality that it is not clear what the point is.
0.7 <|###|> It's surprising to note that this film, mostly well-acted, is somewhat lacking on the technical side, which is what Hollywood usually does best these days.
0.75 <|###|> Predictably, it's (almost) the exact same film, but I wouldn't say that it's a pointless enterprise.
0.2 <|###|> It's not so much that this movie didn't need to be made. The real tragedy is that a group of enormously talented people wasted several months of their lives when together they could have done something fresh and exciting and original.
0.6 <|###|> Gus Van Sant assumiu um trabalho ingrato: quando as cenas funcionam, em seu filme, a responsabilidade e de Hitchcock. Quando falham, a culpa e sua.
0.25 <|###|> An utterly empty technical achievement.
0.7 <|###|> What scared audiences then will almost certainly strike kids raised on the unholy trinity of Michael, Jason and Freddy as quaint and slow.
0.4 <|###|> Van Sant's pseudo-Xerox is flat, mannered and often downright boring!
0.5 <|###|> Es mejor que las nuevas generaciones vayan a la tienda de videos y renten la version original
0.375 <|###|> Vince Vaughn is probably the best person you can get to fill Anthony Perkins' shoes; he can be one of America's best film stars one day, and that is evident in the way he treats his character on screen.
0.5 <|###|> Whereas the original was fascinating and shocking, the reconstruction is bland and lifeless.
0.2 <|###|> Vince Vaughn's Norman Bates is about as terrifying as a tranquilized dachshund.
0.625 <|###|> Less a remake and more a scene-by-scene reconstruction, with all of the original dialogue intact.
0.5 <|###|> It is only because of a few elements of original creativity that Van Sant and the rest should be saved from eternal film damnation.
0.75 <|###|> This gutsy cinematic experiment is more than just a curiosity. It's an intelligent homage (at times even a spoof) and still a bit of a hand-wringer, even though pop culture has spoiled all the surprises.
0.5 <|###|> Having all of this distinctly '60s material played out by '90s performers in living color makes for a film that feels jarringly anachronistic...
0.875 <|###|> Is this film better than the original? The answer is no, not quite, but to my shock, it is just about as good of a remake as could have possibly been expected.
0.6 <|###|> There's nothing exactly wrong with Vaughn's performance, which is edgy and scary. Vaughn simply can't help the fact that physically, he is completely wrong for the role.
0.875 <|###|> Vaughn, from the outset, seems like a loose cannon, a nut case, a psycho. Unlike Anthony Perkins who, at first, appeared as a shy mama's boy, Vaughn adds an extra layer of menace to his Norman that renders Van Sant's film a bit a-kilter.
0.6 <|###|> The one actor who stood out from the pack was definitely the rising star of the year, Vince Vaughn, who took Anthony Perkins' superb original performance, and added his own macabre touch of surrealism.
0.75 <|###|> Vaughn and Heche bring energy and freshness to the parts originated by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. Heche is so good, in fact, and so frisky and watchable in her role, that after her grisly demise in the shower you miss her for a long time.
0.75 <|###|> Though some hard-core fans of the original may scoff at anything that tries to compete, Van Sant's version of Psycho is actually pretty good.
0.6 <|###|> Since this is a virtual shot-by-shot, line-by-line remake of the original masterpiece, it's like watching a new version of a Shakespeare play. Think about it.
0.5 <|###|> Lacking the faith in God and Hollywood kitsch that motivated Cecil B. DeMille, Ridley Scott's modern-day Bible epic is much less gripping than any movie with plagues of frogs and boils ought to be.
0.625 <|###|> There's no arguing the immensity of it or the beauty of its visual images. But what's around the many show-stopping moments is too generic to send us out of the theater properly awestruck, reverent and wowed.
0.4 <|###|> I found myself longing for the clarity of Darren Aronofsky's recent Noah, which acknowledged the insane implications of its story by putting rock monsters (fallen angels!) on the screen.
0.75 <|###|> Exodus: Gods and Kings is by no means a perfect film. But it's a very good film with exceptional devotion to craft, which is more than can be said for many other Bible-themed movies, which often favor accuracy over artistry.
0.4 <|###|> It's a story that has been told and retold for thousands of years, but this po-faced, dutifully spectacular retelling barely lingers in the memory beyond the end credits.
0.5 <|###|> Walk on the bland side in a comic book of biblical proportions.
0.4 <|###|> This sour Moses - whose visions come after a biff on the head - emerges as a certifiable lunatic who gets lucky with a few meteorological, geographical and zoological anomalies.
0.625 <|###|> Despite the always-commanding Bale as Moses, the emotional side of this story is lacking.
0.625 <|###|> Ridley Scott's biblical epic "Exodus: Gods and Kings" is by turns fascinating and infuriating, exciting and tedious, head-scratching and inspiring.
0.4 <|###|> Yes, there is spectacle, although the initially promising parting of the Red Sea is almost drowned by waves of climactic silliness.
0.6 <|###|> The excitement is dampened by a draggy middle where Moses gets married and a tedious epilogue, but Scott's keen ability to explain scripture miracles in credible terms is this biblical blockbuster's major asset.
0.6 <|###|> Ultimately, it's a determinedly un-ironic biblical epic which may have no time for laughs but shows a keen capacity to tell a decent story well.
0.3 <|###|> The assortment of four credited writers charged with getting Exodus whipped into shape did an alarmingly terrible job of it.
0.4 <|###|> It's sad to say that the most interesting aspects of this film don't actually occur on the screen.
0.6 <|###|> From a visual perspective, Scott has created a picture that, at times, can take your breath away, but he loses sight of the more intimate, idiosyncratic elements that should elevate and humanise this narrative.
0.6 <|###|> In a world still being torn apart by religious conflict, the film does have a resonance beyond the grand visual sweep that Scott can always be relied upon to deliver.
0.4 <|###|> Just another disappointingly so-so Scott production - more Kingdom of Heaven than Gladiator.
0.6 <|###|> Exodus feels like a missed opportunity.
0.8 <|###|> Trust Ridley Scott to give us a bold, revisionist take on the foundation story of three major world religions.
0.6 <|###|> Whether it's Ramses losing half his army in a horrific landslide or vast, sweeping panoramas of the Pharaoh's Egypt in all its blood-built glory, Exodus is an entertainment of the first order.
0.5 <|###|> the film's racial issues only make it seem that much leaden, unimaginative, and old-fashioned
0.6 <|###|> Scott once seemed divine. Look on [Exodus], ye mighty, and despair.
0.6 <|###|> Aside from impressive 21st century digital effects, this new take on the Moses story pales in comparison to Cecil B. DeMille's iconic 1956 version, The Ten Commandments, which is far more resonant and intensely dramatic.
0.6 <|###|> It's in the spectacle elements that Scott's film thrives, and of his recent big-budget mediocrities, Exodus is probably the best.
0.4 <|###|> How do you screw up the parting of the Red Sea? How does Ridley Scott?
0.5 <|###|> Production Stands Tall, Story Washed Out
0.35 <|###|> Exodus frequently feels like it is running down a checklist of scenes and events rather than telling a natural story.
0.5 <|###|> The film's emotional component hinges on Moses leaving his wife and young son for a long and dangerous journey. But what you'll remember best is all the smiting.
0.5 <|###|> His direction snaps to life in the big moments, which have an energy and drive missing from the rest of the movie.
0.4 <|###|> Even Christian Bale's noteworthy performance can't save the fact that Exodus: Gods and Kings never finds a proper pace thanks to its offbeat storytelling.
0.8 <|###|> 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' is spectacular.
0.6 <|###|> Ridley Scott only barely manages to pull this off by playing the spectacle card with 'Exodus: Gods and Kings.'
0.9 <|###|> full of plausible evolutions of current technology with a believable if not pleasant feel for how these changes will fit into our world.
0.8 <|###|> what you'll be left with after seeing Sleep Dealer is not a collection of cool scenes so much as a collection of compelling questions about where our world is headed
0.5 <|###|> Sleep Dealer is flawed, but still vibrant and inventive. Whether he finds larger budgets or keeps doing movie like this, Rivera is definitely a filmmaker to follow.
0.75 <|###|> Alex Rivera's overstuffed but intriguing feature debut, Sleep Dealer, takes a speculative leap into Tijuana's near future, imagining the next evolution of cheap labor.
0.75 <|###|> Clearly, Rivera knows one of the great gifts of the sci-fi genre. An uncanny world invites new ways of seeing. It offers new chances to ask the hard -- and too often, hardened -- questions.
0.75 <|###|> The combination of rusty amateurism, future technology, and clear-and-present politics creates a trippy time-space kick: This dusty little movie feels like yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
0.8 <|###|> Adventurous, ambitious and ingeniously futuristic, Sleep Dealer is a welcome surprise.
0.8 <|###|> Sleep Dealer is an unusually thoughtful science fiction film, using the speculative energy of the genre to explore some troubling and complex contemporary issues.
0.5 <|###|> A jumbled vision ... too many predictable lines like, 'Sometimes you control the machine, and sometimes the machine controls you.'
0.625 <|###|> Modest sci-fi entry out of Mexico %u2013 about the ultimate offshore labor force - shows impressive vision but lacks the story to keep it going.
0.625 <|###|> Demonstrates the difficulties that result from leaving home to find work, but in classic B-movie fashion it has a lot of fun with it too:
0.5 <|###|> Galifianakis [is] able to turn on a dime; balancing his disarming humour with moments of anguished outbreaks. His is one of the best supporting performances of recent memory; equally funny and heartbreaking. If only I could say the same of the movie.
0.6 <|###|> For all its problems, though, the film is easy-going, frequently channels into a sweet-natured tone and is able to raise a few chuckles.
0.4 <|###|> It may not be One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but it's also not Patch Adams.
0.5 <|###|> It's also a kind of two-dimensional romance, a kind of flippant look at life on a mental ward, and (...) kind of made me want to give Zach Galifianakis a hug.
0.625 <|###|> It's Kind of a Funny Story lacks substance, but after you've spent a short time in this ward, you have to agree with Craig: These crazies aren't so bad.
0.6 <|###|> Wavering between affecting dramedy and goofy asylum- com, this is an enjoyable but superficial placebo that soft-soaps the realities of psychological disorder.
0.4 <|###|> [A] flimsy, box-ticking quirk fest.
0.4 <|###|> As a self-help sitcom, it feels both glib and icky. Glicky?
0.4 <|###|> In the end, like the instantly-forgettable title, it's kind of neither one thing nor the other and certainly no match for the likes of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or even Girl, Interrupted.
0.2 <|###|> No it's not. It's kind of a rubbish story.
0.4 <|###|> As disposable as a paper cup and, for such promising directors, a serious regression.
0.8 <|###|> It's a fine teen film - and how often do you see those words in the same sentence?
0.6 <|###|> A pleasant movie, but no more.
0.4 <|###|> It kind of isn't.
0.8 <|###|> In the end, the title of the film contains an irony that may be lost on the filmmakers: this is kind of a funny story, no more, no less.
0.5 <|###|> Has a genuine understanding of the protagonist, but ends up betraying him.
0.7 <|###|> It's a neat comedy without being a neat and tidy comedy.
0.75 <|###|> The journey is aided immeasurably by the casting of Keir Gilchrist as young Craig. He has dark, sensitive eyes and a probity about him that wins you to his side.
0.875 <|###|> Here is the most uplifting, quirky film I've seen in a long time. It brought me joy.
0.75 <|###|> Writing and directing partners Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have come up with a smart little film, a gentle drama with both an embraceable tone and a refreshing optimism.
0.6 <|###|> Even though the film is somewhat mopey, it's also packed with great moments.
0.625 <|###|> kind of funny, kind of touching, kind of moving, kind of odd, kind of quirky, and kind of lots of other thing, but, it's never fully anything
0.5 <|###|> The people most out of touch with reality are not those onscreen, but the people behind the camera who think this film is a reflection of coping with depression.
0.6 <|###|> Enjoyable comedy/drama with an engaging script, appealing characters, a superb soundtrack and terrific central performances from Keir Gilchrist and Zach Galifianakis.
0.3 <|###|> The title of 'best movie ever set in a mental hospital' remains firmly secure with 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'
0.86 <|###|> ...sort of upper-middle class Precious, an emo flick for self-indulgent white kids who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf.
0.625 <|###|> Low-key adolescent angst, marred by the type of brief fantasy shots and sequences (the characters as rock stars, lip-synching 'Under Pressure') that have become a let's-go-for-an-easy-laugh crutch for filmmakers.
0.75 <|###|> Zach G.is the next Bill Murray.
0.75 <|###|> It's a less anguished, much funnier 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'...
0.75 <|###|> ...able to honestly juggle mental illness and a sense of hope.
0.9 <|###|> A rich and unusual film that really defies categorization.
0.75 <|###|> The writing-directing team of Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden have created a solid mix of serious, darker scenes and flights of fancy.
0.75 <|###|> The acting is strong, with Galifianakis doing an especially good job as the likeable Bobby.
0.625 <|###|> Is that the best approach to take about a subject as heady as mental illness, especially at a time when there are more kids on Zoloft than Flintstones? chewables?
0.375 <|###|> Where?s Nurse Ratched when you really need her?
0.71 <|###|> Call it "Cuckoo Light" with a PG 13-appropriate amount of angst and just enough laughs and creativity to keep your attention.
0.75 <|###|> It?s no "One Flew Over the Cuckoo?s Nest," but this little dramedy about life in a Brooklyn psych ward has its small charms.
0.6 <|###|> Contrived though the situation may sound, Akers orchestrates it with style
0.75 <|###|> Former actor Don Taylor directs smoothly and efficiently and elicits fine performances from the cast.
0.6 <|###|> Passable entertainment, but it's no fun watching the likable, witty Cornelius and Zira become hairy martyrs.
0.6 <|###|> the film is a highly satisfying mix of satire and suspense
0.7 <|###|> One of the better new movies in town, and better in a genre -- science-fiction -- that at the crucial middle level where the history of movies is made, if not written, has recently been not so much bad as invisible.
0.6 <|###|> The last of the "Ape" sequels that's worth watching.
0.6 <|###|> Possibly the least of the series, but certainly not a predictable sequel.
0.8 <|###|> Oneof the best of the bunch!
0.5 <|###|> feels like a quickie insert that is needed to progress the larger narrative, but doesn't have enough meat on it to deserve its own film
0.6 <|###|> Brings just enough of a twist to the series' conventions.
0.6 <|###|> The best of the all of the sequels.
0.6 <|###|> It works fairly well as the central movie of the franchise but will have little to offer non-devotees.
0.75 <|###|> Regarded by some as the best of the Planet of the Apes sequels, maybe even on a par with the 1968 Charlton Heston original itself, this third Apes movie breathes fresh air into [the] series.
0.6 <|###|> Sunshine Cleaning a compelling and thoroughly adult picture, boasting an original plot and, in Adams and Blunt, two of the most talented young actresses working today.
0.8 <|###|> Amy Adams and Emily Blunt, two fine actresses, get the opportunity to glow in strong lead roles as complex, emotionally fractured females who work hard to earn your respect -- and reclaim their own.
0.7 <|###|> Sunshine Cleaning is a decent film, especially if you already like this sort of thing, with a lot of subtlety and a desire to represent actual human beings without demonizing or beatifying any of them.
0.6 <|###|> Well worth a look for those who aren't too disillusioned with the post-Juno Indie film scene.
0.7 <|###|> Amy Adams sweeps through the wide-ranging role with zest, enthusiasm and just the right touch of simmering self-anger.
0.8 <|###|> More sobering than laugh-out-loud funny, Sunshine Cleaning gives full weight to the impact of death without rubbing our faces in the crime scenes.
0.75 <|###|> Megan Holley's script feels like it's been Sundance-workshopped to death. However, the cast - led by Amy Adams, Emily Blunt and Alan Arkin - establishes a vibrantly odd family bond that sustains "Sunshine Cleaning" through its dimmer portions.
0.8 <|###|> Driven by top-tier performances from Adams and Blunt, Sunshine Cleaning is a charming dramedy that lifts the dirt on life and death.
0.5 <|###|> Not entirely insubstantial, even as the bulk evaporates from the mind.
0.625 <|###|> The sort of movie you root for, hoping it'll break through to be something special. It never quite does, but it still has the not-insignificant value of two fine actresses cast as sisters. [Blu-ray]
0.8 <|###|> While it may sound like Little Miss Sunshine's poor relative, or Sundance by-the-numbers, this is an enjoyable, poignant, moving and - yes - funny film in its own right.
0.7 <|###|> Everything Amy Adams touches turns to gold, and even here where she is playing a character thoroughly down on her luck, she is luminous.
0.6 <|###|> Jeffs makes a good fist of the direction and Blunt proves that she can do comedy, but it's Adams's comforting, charismatic central turn which really gives the film its lift.
0.6 <|###|> Ultimately, the film is too neat, and too cloyingly sweet to tackle anything resembling real life.
0.4 <|###|> Instead of something fresh and funny, this film is as formulaic and empty as any Hollywood blockbuster.
0.8 <|###|> Jeffs shows economy in her direction and steers through the potentially difficult script with skilful handling of tone and mood, wonderfully striking balance between laughs and tears. What a relief it is to unearth this quietly sparkling gem.
0.6 <|###|> Sunshine Cleaning gets an A for Amy Adams. Injecting some heartfelt, three-dimensional zest into the wispy, two-dimensional story, she spares this copycat indie's blushes and scores a winning combo with Blunt.
0.6 <|###|> The film has poor commercial prospects, as its plot is too slender, its tone too blandly upbeat.
0.6 <|###|> It's a film so achingly average it almost deserves an award for mediocrity.
0.6 <|###|> It's not on a par with Little Miss: there's some whimsical-tragical stuff about talking to the dead via CB radio, and the producers might want to think beyond using "Sunshine" in a title again. But I would have been sorry to miss this.
0.8 <|###|> Sunshine Cleaning is a winning combination of heartbreak and quirky humour.
0.8 <|###|> Sunshine Cleaning will be the sleeper of this year, a movie soon to be talked about in the same breath as Sideways, Juno and Little Miss Sunshine.
0.7 <|###|> Sunshine Cleaning is not perverse for the sake of it: its eccentricities arise from characters whose lives fall outside the life guide manuals.
0.6 <|###|> Could have been a little more darkly comic in places but the performances are superb.
0.8 <|###|> It's worthwhile just for Adams and Blunt, a partnership made in movie heaven.
0.4 <|###|> Best to take a page from Rose's metier and bleach this one fully out of sight and mind.
0.6 <|###|> Occasionally it struggles to walk the line between black comedy and bleak dysfunction. Ultimately, though, this is a fresh and refreshing outing with a surprising amount of heart.
0.6 <|###|> Amy Adams [is] terrific in Sunshine Cleaning but the material lets her down. It's as if it's trying to push every indie film button in the book.
0.5 <|###|> Although the film isn't brilliant, the script has its moments and includes some memorable dialogue: "How'd she die?" "It was a do-it-yourself kinda thing."
0.9 <|###|> So many things worked so well that you might not expect would %u2013 from the cheery fakery of an awkward high school reunion to the complexities of this line of work.
0.875 <|###|> It's still relatively early in the year, but this is definitely one of my favorite films so far in 2009.
0.625 <|###|> It's all a bit over-baked at some moments; other moments shine with the emotional truth that one hopes to find if one must be subjected to a montage of nasty crime scenes.
0.875 <|###|> They're ordinary people doing the best that they can. And that's what makes 'Sunshine Cleaning' so enjoyable for adult audiences.
0.6 <|###|> Sunshine Cleaning is a movie that transcends the obstacles of its genre to sporadically soar to welcome heights. It is characterized by strong direction, skillful editing, and an ensemble cast that will be among the best of the year.
0.6 <|###|> Gory, scary, violent sci-fi is too intense for kids.
0.75 <|###|> ...boasts a tongue-in-cheek, downright campy sensibility that ultimately pervades every aspect of the proceedings.
1.0 <|###|> Insanely subversive...functions as a visually dazzling science-fiction action picture, a philosophical challenge, and a hilarious, incisive comedy. [Blu-Ray]
0.8 <|###|> Paul Verhoeven's satiric, 1997, sci-fi, war-movie romance is admittedly an acquired taste.
0.6 <|###|> Utter stupidities and other scientific impossibilities litter the script like trooper body parts . . . [yet] the film does something right
0.5 <|###|> What galls me is the film's marketing, moral and ideological cynicism.
0.7 <|###|> Cut Paul Verhoeven some slack!
0.5 <|###|> Lacking the sophistication of the average comic book, it compensates with panoramic attack sequences, reminiscent of the Japanese swarm attacks in American war movies.
0.75 <|###|> Repulsively thrilling and often downright hilarious.
0.7 <|###|> A jaw-dropping experience, so rigorously one-dimensional and free from even the pretense of intelligence it's hard not to be astonished and even mesmerized by what is on the screen.
0.1 <|###|> It's a cynical wasteland from beginning to end.
0.25 <|###|> A nonstop splatterfest so devoid of taste and logic that it makes even the most brainless summer blockbusters look intelligent.
0.5 <|###|> The enjoyment you get from watching Starship Troopers is similar to the pleasure felt from a loud 'ZAP' from a bug zapper. And about as deep.
0.0 <|###|> This flick wallows in just about every moth-ridden cliche known to the film industry and relies almost entirely on naked teenage girls and recycled special effects for what it deems excitement.
0.625 <|###|> Not the return to form for Verhoeven many have called it -- in the end, it is just a step in the right direction.
0.2 <|###|> In the hands of Verhoeven, the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made, a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale.
0.4 <|###|> Nobody objects to a simple gross-out proposition on the big screen. But here too, Starship Troopers doesn't quite make it.
0.5 <|###|> The action sequences are heavily laden with special effects, but curiously joyless.
0.75 <|###|> It's a sci-fi gorefest, and a fun one at that.
0.875 <|###|> The battle scenes are phenomenal, both for the realistic and clever special effects and for the humor.
0.875 <|###|> Intellectually, I can't really condone that message, but I have to admit that this will be a guilty pleasure of mine for years to come.
0.8 <|###|> It is pure Verhoeven -- broad, brash and ultraviolent, and all up there on the screen.
0.7 <|###|> Enjoyable despite the little redemption it offers humankind, Troopers fits every Hollywood convention while simultaneously breaking each one.
0.75 <|###|> May just be the bug movie to end all bug movies.
0.875 <|###|> Terrific entertainment.
0.4 <|###|> As written by Ed Neumeier, who also wrote Verhoeven's much tighter Robocop, Starship Troopers never gets over its 180-degree swivel from teen-age love story to murderous destruction.
0.75 <|###|> As a brainless bubblegum movie, it's an exhilarating adrenaline rush.
0.7 <|###|> Just enjoy the fun of watching Neil Patrick Harris in his audition for Apt Pupil and roll with it, baby.
0.75 <|###|> This is powerful entertainment that appeals to our most basic instincts.
0.8 <|###|> Manages to be both fun and shocking -- sometimes in the same shot.
1.0 <|###|> Director Paul Verhoeven is back in his subversively nimble RoboCop groove with the uproariously cheeky Starship Troopers.
0.75 <|###|> Flawed but fun.
0.875 <|###|> Shrug however you might at a story that has to pack so many characters and tangents into 140 minutes; it will still be difficult for me to see beyond the joyous awesomeness.
0.8 <|###|> It's little surprise this is largely a terrifically enjoyable experience -- one that'll please both fanboys and the public at large.
0.6 <|###|> Of course it's about one hundred times brighter than Transformers and Michael Bay's imbecilic spinoffs, and should keep multiplexes everywhere in its competent grip. But I didn't love it.
1.0 <|###|> Smart, witty, funny, action-packed and surprisingly cathartic.
0.7 <|###|> The bigger and goofier it gets, the more fun it becomes.
0.7 <|###|> A fun light-hearted summer blockbuster that is weighed down by a forgettable villain.
0.6 <|###|> Fast-paced superhero series sequel will be fun for fans.
0.75 <|###|> Whedon must balance the competing storylines and screen time of the actors. He does it nicely, injecting humour and a touch of drama into the action -- and all without so much as a Tesseract to his name. Some assembly required, and delivered.
0.8 <|###|> Whedon has delivered that rare action-packed, special-effects spectacle that is relentless in its eagerness to please and successful beyond its goal.
0.8 <|###|> It's Summer's Mightiest Movie. Nuff said.
0.9 <|###|> Was Marvel's ambitious dream for a shared cinematic universe truly worth it? In my opinion: Most definitely.
0.85 <|###|> The Avengers is one of the best superheroes movies in a long time and is likely to become a classic of the genre. You would need to really hate comic book movies not to get a kick out of this.
0.95 <|###|> The Star Wars of a new generation.
0.8 <|###|> "Marvel's The Avengers" is a visual comic book and it doesn't aspire to be anything more than that. As a film version it succeeds-one is tempted to say-MIGHTILY.
0.75 <|###|> It really is quite something that [Whedon] was able to take so many characters and put them into a movie where nobody gets left behind.
0.8 <|###|> It really is an astounding achievement - a film that juggles an unenviable number of elements; combining what we've seen before, slotting them together and then adding enough depth, action and humour to make this a remarkable standalone film.
0.7 <|###|> Marvel's "The Avengers" is the super-hero movie to end all super-hero movies. Why? Joss Whedon.
0.6 <|###|> After years of buildup and prequels, "The Avengers" is merely average.
0.95 <|###|> The first great superhero team movie, and a film that captures the essence of what makes the Marvel Universe great.
0.6 <|###|> While it reflects a movie culture that has traded originality for scale - one wonders if there's a shred of originality anywhere in the film - The Avengers is grand, throwaway fun.
0.875 <|###|> Yeah, it's all that. A tent-pole cash cow for the studio, a dream come true for fans, and treat for action aficionados, 'The Avengers' comes at you as the first true "summer movie spectacular" of the 2012 season.
0.2 <|###|> The overlong, stale experience barely raises a fast pulse, as the movie quickly stumbles into a standard film structure and doesn't even try to break free.
0.875 <|###|> The culmination of four distinct franchises is an exciting and entertaining product.
0.875 <|###|> Whedon's clear fanboy glee is irresistibly contagious to the audience, whether the heroes and villains go at it with fisticuffs or sharp, witty dialogue.
0.5 <|###|> By the time the utterly routine (and decidedly endless) finale rolls around, Marvel's The Avengers has unquestionably squandered the potential of its premise and its cast...
1.0 <|###|> Delivers big time with everything longtime fans and newcomers alike could possibly want in a summer blockbuster that definitely surpasses the hype.
1.0 <|###|> ... tremendous fun ...
0.3 <|###|> Nine-year-old kids may sit through it and have fun, but nine-year-olds would also eat french fries 23 hours a day if their parents didn't force them to try something more nutritious.
0.5 <|###|> The result is 80 brief minutes of movie skits assembled in an order that sort of resembles a plot.
0.5 <|###|> The movie will be of interest only to Nielsen's most devoted fans and to those who wonder why Nicollette Sheridan never made more movies, or more swimsuit calendars.
0.5 <|###|> The jokes come in sporadic volleys rather than the steady machine-gun pace of The Naked Gun and Airplane!, and, with a few exceptions, they are less truly aimed.
0.4 <|###|> The blockbuster action thriller genre is ripe for sending up, but this lazy effort has to go down as a miss despite the presence of spoofmeister Leslie Nielsen.
0.4 <|###|> Sporadically funny, but never more than a sting of crude gags.
0.5 <|###|> Yet another Leslie Nielson movie parody, targeted this time at James Bond pictures and their many spinoffs.
0.375 <|###|> As funny as Nielsen can be, like all comic actors he still needs the quick-thinking jokes and zingy one-liners to be genuinely funny.
0.5 <|###|> Spy Hard just comes off as a long commercial. And yes, that means most of the best moments you've seen in the movie's trailer.
0.375 <|###|> Nielsen's schtick is getting pretty threadbare by now -- his movies used to wring laughs from assaults on his silver-haired dignity, but after years of screen buffoonery, he has no dignity left to assault.
0.5 <|###|> A classic example of why David Zucker/Jim Abrahams/Jerry Zucker-style comedies should be left to ZAZ themselves.
0.2 <|###|> Stay for Weird Al Yankovic's brilliant opening credits, then flee!
0.0 <|###|> Nielsen, with his expert deadpan and sense of comic timing, creates the illusion of humor -- for about 15 minutes.
0.4 <|###|> [Scores] only a handful of genuine laughs during its scant 78 minutes.
0.25 <|###|> Most of the humor falls flatter than Steve Forbes' flat tax pitch.
0.375 <|###|> A dreadfully unfunny comedy that takes Naked Gun-like sketches and rehashes them without a whit of style or energy.
0.25 <|###|> Never consistently humorous.
0.1 <|###|> Filled to the bursting point with witless, sub-Mad magazine movie parodies, pointless cameos by a seemingly endless parade of has-beens, and once-hysterical, now stale jokes lifted straight from Airplane! and the original Naked Gun...
0.375 <|###|> You know you're in trouble when the highlight of a movie comes during its opening credits.
0.375 <|###|> You won't laugh hard at Spy Hard. And that's not because the jokes aren't funny. Most of them aren't even jokes.
0.3 <|###|> Ugh.
0.75 <|###|> A rollicking paean to the musical that owes as much to Hollywood as it does to Bollywood.
0.8 <|###|> Wristcutters: A Love Story is like a suicidal Wizard of Oz.
0.2 <|###|> It is a staggeringly awful road movie, not much enlivened by the presence of Tom Waits as a wizened participant.
0.6 <|###|> The purgatorial premise is pleasingly eccentric but, in the end, Wristcutters falls victim to its washed-out mood, and limps bloodlessly to a close.
0.4 <|###|> A dreary, self-consciously quirky indie flick that seems to go on forever, despite an economical running time.
0.5 <|###|> Veering from witty to occasionally trite, Wristcutters: A Love Story has plenty of originality on its side, but never manages to be more than the sum of its self-consciously quirky parts.
0.6 <|###|> A little self-consciously kooky but with an ace soundtrack that combines gypsy punksters Gogol Bordello with real-life plug-pullers this sure beats putting your head in the oven.
0.6 <|###|> Dark subject matter, but Goran Dukic's film is whimsical and determinedly optimistic about life.
0.6 <|###|> For the better part of the journey this a bizarrely uplifting yarn - razor sharp, you might say.
0.3333333333333333 <|###|> Opportunities to comment on the ethical grey areas of suicide are mostly squandered and, as the pointless digressions begin to pile up, your mind begins to drift from the action on screen.
0.8 <|###|> Enjoyably quirky black comedy that's clearly destined to become a cult movie amongst the Gothic contingent.
0.6 <|###|> Despite being occasionally hilarious, director Goran Dukic should have toned down the wackiness.
0.4 <|###|> Another indie director more interested in style than substance.
0.4 <|###|> If you're going to make a comedy about suicide, you'd better make sure the jokes land. There are people out there who could use a laugh.
0.75 <|###|> It has 'midnight movie' written all over it.
0.75 <|###|> Wristcutters is a small film of ambitions nicely scaled to the performances and story. Who knew that affectless characters could be so oddly affecting?
0.6 <|###|> Wristcutters opens with what proves to be its best scene, one that could stand alone as a brilliant short subject.
0.8 <|###|> The vision of life after death varies between the religious and the non-religious, the optimists and the pessimists and the believers and non-believers. There are few after-life stories, though, as unique and humorous as this.
0.75 <|###|> All this sounds rather grim, and indeed it is -- but this backward Heaven Can Wait is also, thanks to [director] Dukic's inventive imagination, surprisingly involving and ultimately sweet.
0.75 <|###|> Wristcutters is a cut above most low-budget American indies, with something original to say about the human condition and an artful way of saying it.
0.375 <|###|> Goran Dukic's film starts off seeming hip and funky and dark, but almost immediately runs out of steam. It feels like a short carelessly padded to feature length.
0.5 <|###|> The future of Wristcutters as a cult favorite is less assured. Rather than benefiting from repeated viewings, the movie's charm is pretty much spent after the first half hour.
0.625 <|###|> We witness the birth of a new genre, the Post-Slasher Movie.
0.75 <|###|> Croatian filmmaker Goran Dukic's debut feature turns out to be a sweetly grim lark: a road film through Limbo.
0.75 <|###|> ...more whimsical and charming than you would ever expect from a picture about suicide.
0.7 <|###|> Though it goes a bit wonky toward the end and seems to travel a very long way to drive home a rather simple point, Wristcutters: A Love Story remains a wonderfully evocative experience.
0.5 <|###|> Almost 40 years ago Easy Rider established that road trips can make great independent films. Or at least cheap ones. But when booking a room inside the pearly gates, cheap may not be exactly what you're looking for.
0.5 <|###|> Screenwriter/director Goran Dukic can't quite decide on a tone. The film is at times lighthearted, almost effervescent, and then it's so dark that it becomes depressingly bleak.
0.625 <|###|> Wristcutters is quite a bit darker than most mainstream romantic comedies. As you might not expect, it's also quite a bit more inventive and far wittier than most mainstream romantic comedies.
0.8 <|###|> Goran Dukic, working from a short story by Etgar Kiret, has fashioned a life-after-death that is both somber and silly.
0.3 <|###|> The witless Wristcutters holds all the fascination of a train wreck. Youa(TM)ll stay in your seat just to see if ita(TM)ll get any worse, and you wona(TM)t be disappointed.
0.4 <|###|> Immature ideas amateurishly executed ...
0.625 <|###|> The mumblecore dialogue can be annoying, but along with the excellent score, it actually serves this tense haziness well.
0.7 <|###|> A slow but sure essay on the strengths and weaknesses of love and possession.
0.6 <|###|> Takal has a gift for dialogue and for character, the latter especially strong when it comes to Genevieve.
0.6 <|###|> Mostly animated PG film has gross-out humor, violence.
0.5 <|###|> I enjoyed it. It's a fun, dumb and gross comedy that kids will love.
0.7 <|###|> You'll probably find yourself laughing at Bill Murray farting. I did.
0.75 <|###|> It is funny, original, and even contains a genuine, good-natured theme.
0.5 <|###|> ...the whole thing eventually becomes bogged down in its own plot.
0.4 <|###|> The ideas are there, hints of genius, but no one ignites them.
0.8 <|###|> I'd advise attendees of this film to go on an empty stomach, but if you're willing to endure the Farrellys' warped sense of humor and Murray's scratching, squirting, gas-passing antics, Osmosis Jones offers some lighthearted fun.
0.8 <|###|> The over-riding question with all comedies is 'Are there many laughs in it?' Luckily, the answer is yes - there are lots of great jokes, and not all of the scatological kind.
0.625 <|###|> The design of this colorful interior metropolis is both clever and biologically correct.
0.875 <|###|> Deserves all the praise showered upon the overrated Shrek.
0.75 <|###|> Leave it to the Farrelly brothers to once again gross us out.
0.6 <|###|> The script has just enough clever jokes to keep us chuckling, even if it never scales the heights of classic comedy.
0.5 <|###|> ...it's up to the animation to keep us entertained, and those sections turn out to be much too predictable.
0.75 <|###|> This is the kind of premise you'd expect to be filmed as a five-minute educational video, if at all. But this feature is 95 minutes and never drags.
0.7 <|###|> While it's certainly not among the best movies of the year, Osmosis Jones is not a film that deserved to end up $60 million dollars in the hole.
0.5 <|###|> If there wasn't any live action and the animation bit had been fleshed out more then this could've been a highlight of the season...
0.6 <|###|> An enjoyable, if vastly underachieving, diversion.
0.5 <|###|> ...se disfruta en su parte animada, y mucho mas si se tiene o se recupera cierto espiritu infantil en la edad en la que los pedos, mocos, etc. podian sacar sonrisas .
0.625 <|###|> So what went wrong? In a nutshell, the live action portion.
0.875 <|###|> Osmosis Jones is one of the most daring and original major Hollywood movies in a long time.
0.5 <|###|> Osmosis is missing a spark.
0.8 <|###|> Folks who go to it expecting the traditional Farrelly flood of bodily fluids won't be disappointed, but it's likely they'll laugh harder at the witty dialogue and references to other films.
0.625 <|###|> For the most part, it works because of its own visual inventiveness and the complete lack of pride on the part of both Murray and Elliott.
0.1 <|###|> It should have been placed in a hazardous waste container, encased in concrete and dumped into the Farrelly brothers' septic tank.
0.5 <|###|> Because the film teeters between adult humor and being family oriented -- Osmosis Jones fails to connect with either audience.
0.625 <|###|> never quite takes off the way you're hoping it will
0.5 <|###|> ...ideally suited for the video market.
0.5 <|###|> Despite a barrage of puns that will whiz over the heads of the average eight-year-old ('virus con dios,' 'Funny, he doesn't look fluish,' and the like), this film wasn't intended for the enjoyment of adults.
0.5 <|###|> Isn't a movie so much as a health-class nutrition lecture.
0.375 <|###|> It's no funnier than your average grade-school biology lesson and less pedagogically useful than your typical Farrelly brothers comedy.
0.625 <|###|> ...represents a significant improvement over its lackluster predecessor...
0.4 <|###|> The character development is as thin as shed snakeskin.
0.2 <|###|> This is a film that manages to take what should have been delirious camp fun and turn it into a struggle to keep any remote interest.
0.4 <|###|> Provides some unintentional laughs and genuine bursts of adrenalin, however hokey it gets and however Harry Potterish the snakes.
0.4 <|###|> It's fun to see the characters get eaten up. It's the people who remain alive and talking that may disturb the viewer.
0.3 <|###|> Not especially tedious, the snakes were OK, and I understood most of the conclusion. The only surprise, though, was that I made it to the end.
0.5 <|###|> Obviously the cast and crew don't care that this makes no sense--they got a great holiday in Fiji.
0.8 <|###|> Despite a script that borders on banality ... and Strickland's sometimes distracting emoting, director Little and director of photography Stephen F. Windon do an exceptional job of creating tension.
0.2 <|###|> Se vou perder uma hora e meia de minha vida vendo uma cobra comer pessoas, quero, no minimo, que a refeicao seja composta por caras conhecidas.
0.5 <|###|> Even if it isn't worth the price of admission, it is at least a pretension-free flick.
0.625 <|###|> ...a real popcorn film...
0.6 <|###|> Surprisingly, Anacondas turns out to be much more entertaining than it has any right to be.
0.5 <|###|> It's predictable. It's clich&#233;. But it's fun to watch.
0.6 <|###|> It took four screenwriters to cobble this together. That's reasonable. With the death of Ed Wood, it's not possible for any one person to come up with anything this screwy.
0.75 <|###|> ...easily the best mainstream release of the summer... an example of first-rate B moviemaking.
0.25 <|###|> I never thought a film about giant snakes that eat people could be this atrociously dull.
0.4 <|###|> At best, it will come as a pleasant surprise to those going in with the lowest of preconceptions. At worst, it offers audiences a chance to get out of the August heat for 90 minutes.
0.5 <|###|> When the snakes do attack, there's not much originality or surprise to their methods. No one gets spun up and down like a yo-yo, or puked back up.
0.375 <|###|> More snakes does not a better movie make.
0.625 <|###|> If you just want to see giant snakes eating people who talk too much and need to die because of sheer stupidity, this movie is for you.
0.6 <|###|> The big snake is back and he's brought along some friends.
0.625 <|###|> Dwight Little directs this exciting film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
0.3 <|###|> As someone said, the only way you should see this is drunk.
0.4 <|###|> Who knew the science field was so jam-packed with beautiful people?
0.375 <|###|> I can appreciate a good B-movie as much as the next guy, but even by the very relaxed standards of B-moviedom, "Anacondas 2" is a rather sad affair.
0.3 <|###|> The kind of sequel that should have gone directly to DVD shelves.
0.2 <|###|> How ridiculous is this? They depend on cellphones that even work in the remote jungle.
0.375 <|###|> The only surprise in this unintentionally funny scarefest is learning that the characters you hope get eaten first, darn the luck, make it to the finish.
0.375 <|###|> Stinky cheese.
0.5 <|###|> Supremely silly but undeniably fun.
0.2 <|###|> 'There's a way in. There's a way out.' He's right. It's behind you, right below the sign that says Exit. Just follow the stampede.
0.75 <|###|> Wisely prods not only ordinary phobias about big, bad serpents but also universal terrors of the dark, of narrow spaces, of drowning, of falling, of spiders and much more.
0.25 <|###|> The sequel might have the formula down, but it lacks everything that made Anaconda fun.
0.4 <|###|> As the narrative lugubriously sticks to the documented events, we are served nothing more than a filmed transcript.
0.5 <|###|> It's well-constructed and acted, but mainly just left me feeling like I needed a shower after an exercise in voyeurism surrounding an event that's still hard to watch.
0.375 <|###|> Even if you can forgive [director] Piddington's mangling of the basics, you will find it hard to overlook his frantic use of slo-mo, a wobbly camera, freeze frames, double exposures and a close-up of a single eye.
0.625 <|###|> Though the psychic space Piddington and Ball create is certainly a terrifyingly claustrophobic place to be, it's also stultifying and banal in the way other people's crazed obsessions become after a very short while.
0.5 <|###|> The only revelations in The Killing of John Lennon are those we could have picked up ourselves, assuming we cared enough to do so.
0.6 <|###|> Only slightly better than Chapter 27, it's questionable whether even the most morbidly curious John Lennon fan might have any interest in sitting through nearly two hours of this creepy lunatic.
0.75 <|###|> Piddington does a beautiful balancing act, creating a movie that works both on the level of suspense and as a detailed factual chronicle.
0.6 <|###|> Andrew Piddington's devastating re-enactment of events leading up to, including and immediately after the murder is taken from interviews, depositions and court transcripts.
0.5 <|###|> Piddington never dares to diagnose Chapman's rage, settling for Wikipedia-style objectivity dressed in the more fatuous-than-provocative manner of Robinson Devor's Zoo.
0.4 <|###|> Charting Chapman's relationship with The Catcher in the Rye to being quizzed after the murder, this is an engrossing study - but paper thin.
0.2 <|###|> It features actor Jonas Ball looking more or less like the famed police mugshot, lumbering about with Chapman's own interminable (but avowedly authentic) prison-diary ramblings recited in voiceover.
0.0 <|###|> The makers of this tasteless and generally bleak recreation of Chapman's life in the three months before the killing just didn't get it. The man who shot the ex-Beatle deserves to rot unforgotten in his six by ten, not have films made about him.
0.6 <|###|> There's a feeling of eerie otherworldliness and the murder itself is relished in detail, however the film does lack overall impact
0.3333333333333333 <|###|> Chapman was on a simple, skewed quest for infamy. And he got it. One gathers he'd be chuffed to see this film. And that's the biggest issue of all.
0.8 <|###|> Unlike shabby exploitation docu-dramas such as Bundy, this is an honest meditation on the warped assassin and his motives and assumes the tension of a thriller as the appointed time approaches.
0.8 <|###|> A transfixing recreation of the events that shocked the world.
0.4 <|###|> Tense until the murder, but Piddington assumes we all care as much about Chapman as he does.
0.8 <|###|> Piddington has pulled off a delicate balancing act, presenting Chapman as an explosive by-product of our celebrity-obsessed times, while resisting the temptation to validate Chapman's own elaborate self-mythologising.
0.2 <|###|> If someone like Levy can't escape the vicious circle of these lousy flicks, what hope do we have?
0.0 <|###|> ...completely and utterly devoid of anything even resembling competence...
0.7 <|###|> A fascinatingly disjointed hybrid of Western and combat film.
0.9 <|###|> One of Leone's best movies -- and one of his looniest, which may be exactly why it's one of the best.
0.8 <|###|> Not exactly classic Leone, but enjoyable nonetheless as many of the great elements are in place: maverick heroes, action, and Ennio Morricone music.
0.5 <|###|> The idiosyncrasies are there, all right, but they have never seemed less interesting.
0.75 <|###|> Well-plotted action, but as in most of Leone's films scenes seem to have been deleted from the American prints.
0.875 <|###|> Woefully overlooked... Top-tier widescreen action... Ennio Morricone's enchanting score and Leone's trademark flourishes handshake in wild agreement. Sucker punches its way to the top of the Italian-western mountains.
1.0 <|###|> Features one of the most glorious and unforgettable scores by Leone's composer, Ennio Morricone.
0.75 <|###|> not mean to be taken seriously
0.5 <|###|> [The characters] aren't people; they're mere objects to stick in front of the flowing lava.
0.25 <|###|> Movie bombs L.A. with lava, audience with stupidity
0.5 <|###|> The special effects are impressive and the acting by Jones and Heche is good, although their roles didn't require much skill or inspiration.
0.625 <|###|> The film, about a volcano erupting in downtown Los Angeles, is helped immeasurably by veteran actor Tommy Lee Jones, who has enough charm and charisma to rescue just about any movie. He needs it all to save this one.
0.75 <|###|> On its own escapist terms, Volcano dishes up a textbook serving of low-I.Q., high-energy entertainment.
0.6 <|###|> The action, the effects and tough-as-nails Tommy Lee provide a worthwhile thrill ride -- even if the last drop wasn't as big as you thought it would be.
0.625 <|###|> gives us the bare minimums needed for a story and then lets the lava flow
0.6 <|###|> The coast may be toast, but it's the lava, covering everything like a malevolent tide of melted butter, that makes this a disaster picture that's tastier than usual.
0.2 <|###|> There's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone.
0.25 <|###|> I don't want to pay $7.50 to watch a movie imitate CNN.
0.5 <|###|> Oh, there's nothing like a natural disaster to bring people together!
0.375 <|###|> Hundreds of screen technicians obviously slaved on the effects -- and for what? A dopey subplot about a bogus arrest. Soap opera involving Jones' injured daughter.
0.375 <|###|> Volcano is an embarrassment, albeit one of the so-bad-it's-kinda-good variety.
0.8 <|###|> These things can be done well or badly, and Volcano goes full steam ahead.
0.6 <|###|> More about spectacle than suspense, a very impressive production which is easier to enjoy from a detached distance than it is to get caught up in.
0.5 <|###|> Like the substantially better Twister, this film insists on a thunderous, exhausting pace that inevitably becomes deflating.
0.375 <|###|> Volcano is an absolutely standard, assembly-line undertaking; no wonder one of the extras is reading a paperback titled "Screenwriting Made Easy."
0.375 <|###|> A ridiculous script and mediocre special effects mar this ludicrous disaster pic.
0.625 <|###|> Memorable? Hardly, but the main actors are worth seeing, and that first act has so much promise it almost makes you want to forgive them for blowing the second.
0.75 <|###|> This is one of the best pure disaster movies ever made (not that it has much competition). Congratulations to director Mick Jackson for a job well done.
0.5 <|###|> A host of characters is introduced in the opening scenes, but Volcano doesn't know what to do with them. It can't make us care.
0.6 <|###|> The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest doesn't exactly give the Millennium trilogy the explosive send-off it deserves, and stacked against the other two movies in the series, it's perhaps the weakest story of the three.
0.875 <|###|> This film ends up being more of a courtroom drama, and yet it's almost as equally thrilling as the first film in the series.
0.75 <|###|> Unlike its two predecessors, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest boasts a briskly-paced opening half hour that proves effective at immediately drawing the viewer into the movie...
0.6 <|###|> For me the most deadening aspect of these films is the presence of Michael Nykvist as Blomqvist; he seems to have a personality by-pass, and remains expressionless at all times, no matter what's going on.
0.2 <|###|> The best thing that can be said about the excruciatingly dull, badly made closing chapter in this punishingly bad Swedish crime trilogy is that it really whets the appetite for the upcoming American version.
0.8 <|###|> Seeing the first two films -- The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played with Fire -- will make the third film more satisfying.
0.5 <|###|> Lisbeth Salander, played by Noomi Rapace, spends most of the story constrained -- first in the hospital, then in prison. What fun is that?
0.5 <|###|> The third and final entry in Stieg Larsson's enormously successful series is perhaps the least thrilling, but it's easily the most satisfying.
0.8 <|###|> Finale of dark subtitled Swedish trilogy still very violent.
0.6 <|###|> Semi-satisfying, if you can keep up.
0.8 <|###|> The gap between this and Dragon Tattoo is pretty big -- this won't be on my '10 Best' list and Tattoo might -- but as the rest of the story, it does nicely.
0.7 <|###|> While the events are fascinating and entertaining, the film itself is less emotionally involving or viscerally thrilling.
0.4 <|###|> Much of it still plays like bad Thomas Harris...
0.8 <|###|> A pick-up after the second film, if not as assured as the first. Rapace sets a high watermark for Rooney Mara in David Fincher's remakes.
0.2 <|###|> One final course of Europudding that may leave audiences feeling less satisfied than simply tired and bloated.
0.4 <|###|> A more apt title would be 'The Girl Who Sat Quietly in a Dimly Lit Room'.
0.4 <|###|> This is the most disappointing end to a trilogy since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3.
0.6 <|###|> Anyone who has invested in the trilogy will savour the mixture of dread and anticipation as the cat-and-mouse game reaches a stirring conclusion.
0.5 <|###|> A bunch of evil old men get their comeuppance in 'The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,' but the girl who messes with their nest does hardly anything at all.
0.2 <|###|> The third and worst of Stieg Larsson's trilogy is poorly directed, under-energised and unthrilling.
1.0 <|###|> A compelling mix of 70s-style conspiracy thriller, courtroom procedural and psychological drama...
0.8 <|###|> The powerful performances by the leads, unobtrusive direction that is exemplified in a beguiling courtroom clash, and Larsson's deftly interwoven fabric of treachery and compassion all ensure that we are left yearning for more.
0.4 <|###|> As well as being conventional, The Girl Who Kicked is also confusing, dull and grubby (do we really need to see examples from a child-porn site?).
0.2 <|###|> Is the Millennium Trilogy over? Can we go home?
0.2 <|###|> The Girl Who Makes Us Wish We Were Anywhere Else.
0.6 <|###|> The final film based on Stieg Larsson's bestselling thriller trilogy opens with a whimper but ends with a bang.
0.8 <|###|> As ever, Rapace steals every scene she's in, maintaining Lisbeth's moody enigma whether she's lying on her sick bed, making a memorable court entrance in full punk regalia, or taking care of family business.
0.6 <|###|> This remains watchable thanks to Nyqvist and Rapace but the lacklustre direction, lack of pace and bloated script ensure that it's closer to the mediocre nature of the second film than the brilliance of the first.
0.85 <|###|> ...could be read as the passion of Lisbeth Salander, as she undergoes a kind of secular crucifixion at the hands of the Swedish establishment ...
0.6 <|###|> It's enough to see Rapace's Salander smile, however tentatively, however briefly, however unlikely. Those white teeth framed by black-on-black everything? They bite.
0.75 <|###|> The series is quite satisfying as a whole, in the manner of the type of well-made, limited-episode crime program that might appear on AMC or HBO.
0.2 <|###|> The Matrix: Revolutions of the Millennium Trilogy.
0.25 <|###|> While Rapace remains a strong and captivating actress in the title role, the film is remarkably bad. In fact, it's easily one of the year's worst movies. Boring beyond belief.
0.4 <|###|> The Millennium Trilogy follows a similar pattern as The Matrix Trilogy, and that's not a compliment.
0.625 <|###|> The European equivalent of The Matrix Revolutions, this third chapter finds a once-vibrant saga largely coasting on the fumes of its well-regarded predecessors.
0.5 <|###|> When your series' most compelling character remains mute and largely on the periphery of the action (albeit all decked out in punker regalia, including a big Mohawk), something is seriously amiss.
0.75 <|###|> This 148-minute movie is best appreciated if you have already watched the first two movies or read the books. It is not intended to be a standalone film. Neophytes will find themselves lost and confused without sufficient background to fully appreciate...
1.0 <|###|> Seventy-five years on, it hasn't dated in the slightest.
0.8 <|###|> The central themes of illusions, dreams and going on an extraordinary adventure all the better to come home and appreciate what you have there are enduring.
1.0 <|###|> One of Hollywood's quintessential productions, this musical adaptation of L Frank Baum's classic fable is probably the most beloved fantasy film of all time and the ultimate family picture.
1.0 <|###|> This family classic long ago left the realm of being mere entertainment to emerge as a cultural touchstone for generations of Americans.
1.0 <|###|> The Wizard of Oz is the cinematic equivalent of high-end wine, in that it gets better with age. The difference is that while wine must remain unopened to increase in value, the film positively thrives on it being tasted and shared over and over and over.
0.95 <|###|> MGM's fantastic IMAX 3D conversion for the The Wizard of Oz's 75th anniversary underlines rather than obscures most of the film's visual pleasures, reminding us (if we'd managed to forget) just how glorious L. Frank Baum's strange world is.
0.875 <|###|> The blend of old-fashioned, classic storytelling with cutting-edge technology is undeniably enthralling.
1.0 <|###|> Hey, Dorothy actually has freckles in IMAX. Glinda's floating sphere is mesmerizing. The flying monkeys are creepier than ever. The Lollipop Guild even more disturbing - are these guys having a seizure?
1.0 <|###|> Any reason to show your children "The Wizard of Oz" on a big screen seems like a good one.
1.0 <|###|> The best thing about 3D glasses is that they keep your kids from seeing your tears of sentimental joy at this gorgeous restoration
1.0 <|###|> This phantasmagorical fantasy really does represent old-school MGM filmmaking at its best.
1.0 <|###|> It is one of the greatest movies ever made, and even today it stands the test of time as a quality family flick.
1.0 <|###|> Even decades later, one of the best family films ever made.
1.0 <|###|> A head trip of a family film.
1.0 <|###|> The moment Judy Garland starts singing in that barnyard, we're all six years old again, with nothing left to do but join her.
1.0 <|###|> It's more than a movie; it's an American rite of passage. [Blu-ray]
1.0 <|###|> If through some incredible chance you haven't [seen it], all I can say is: do so immediately. Make this the very next movie you watch. Literally.
1.0 <|###|> One of only a handful of films that nearly everyone is familiar with.
1.0 <|###|> The songs and magic are still fresh, even if it isn't quite knowing enough, perhaps, for today's young audiences.
1.0 <|###|> The greatest children's movie of all time. Probably.
1.0 <|###|> This 3D remastering of the original, on a giant Imax screen to boot, brings a whole new sense of wonder to Dorothy's yellow-brick road movie.
1.0 <|###|> I'll see you on the dark side of the moon...and your little dog, too!
0.4 <|###|> Cute but uneven. Best for dog lovers.
0.6 <|###|> If you've followed the previous Shiloh films, then you'll be satisfied, if not overjoyed, by this final chapter.
0.4 <|###|> If you are new to the series, I would suggest your starting with the original Shiloh, so far, the best in show.
0.5 <|###|> Offers exactly what you've come to expect from the series: Bland but wholly innocuous family entertainment featuring a cute kid and an even cuter dog.
0.625 <|###|> Wilson ... makes this film, via grit of detail, a bit more than a Hallmark Special Retro Disney Walton sermon in values.
0.375 <|###|> Boring as porridge.
0.5 <|###|> An OK kids movie passing through on the way to video.
0.5 <|###|> You won't find the pragmatic intelligence of Naylor's original stories here, but even cynics may be touched by the film's remarkably wholesome lessons about friendship, family and forgiveness.
0.875 <|###|> It's a family film that deals with real problems and teaches real values, and yet is exciting and entertaining.
0.5 <|###|> If Sandy Tung's film had flavor, it might taste like a week-old bagel.
0.7 <|###|> Saving Shiloh is touching, intelligent and admirably thoughtful.
0.375 <|###|> ... has more respect for the intelligence of the title dog than its audience.
0.4 <|###|> Two major issues here: The boy, Marty (Jason Dolley), is a patronizing do-gooder, and the dog, a beagle-looking fella, doesn't do much that's special.
0.7 <|###|> On its own merits, has some very fine cinematic flourishes... if we can but manage the herculean feat of separating it from the older movie.
0.4 <|###|> 1985 sequel to American classic is tin-eared and creepy.
0.6 <|###|> Best to see them as individual films with nothing in common apart from source material, one a classic, the other a strong enough picaresque amongst some decent fabulation.
0.625 <|###|> There are some fine, Oscar-nominated special effects, but the excitement just isn't there.
0.8 <|###|> A forgotten classic.
0.6 <|###|> I can see why the Judy Garland fans might not appreciate this weird little adaptation, but it's actually pretty good!
0.2 <|###|> Director Walter Murch tries to infuse the story with the inventiveness and adventure of the Star Wars saga, but the results are disappointing.
1.0 <|###|> Faithfully brings the Oz books to life. A classic.
0.4 <|###|> The work of ingenious technicians who seem either not to know what gave the original film its magic, or not to care.
0.7 <|###|> Return to Oz is hardly as kid-friendly as The Wizard of Oz, but older children with a taste for the fantastic will find it interesting. Adult Oz fans will find it entertaining as well.
0.4 <|###|> Should've stuck to that yellow brick road
0.6 <|###|> An underrated little romp, surprisingly faithful to L. Frank Baum's atmosphere... though obviously it's all overshadowed by that other Oz flick.
0.8 <|###|> An absorbing insight into the life of one of the industry's mot renowned, and elusive stars.
0.4 <|###|> There are some pleasing touches, but this film is a frustrating experience.
0.89 <|###|> The pre-noir gangster genre was in many ways defined by the innovative approaches taken by Hawks in this film.
1.0 <|###|> The greatest gangster movie of the 1930s -- and that means the greatest ever.
1.0 <|###|> [The police chief] endorses the myth of the west while conceiving the urban gangster as a rat-like menace.
1.0 <|###|> Completely relevant: Citizens complain that access to technologically more efficient guns is partly to blame for the crime wave; they fret over illegal immigrants; they worry that the 'new breed' of criminal is more uncivilized than its predecessor...
1.0 <|###|> Atmospheric, mesmerising and darkly humourous with a sizzling script and cast. This is a true classic of its genre.
0.85 <|###|> Paul Muni goes way over the top as Tony Camonte, painting a picture of a gangster who knows nothing but excess, and who will stop at nothing to get his way.
1.0 <|###|> The slaughter in Scarface, the Shame of a Nation, the Howard Hughes gangster production... is like that of a Shakespearean tragedy
0.82 <|###|> Hawks displays balls of steel, using the filmic medium to challenge the free reign of mobsters in the 1930's.
1.0 <|###|> The quintessential crime thriller. One of the few perfect films.
1.0 <|###|> The quintessential classic gangster picture.
1.0 <|###|> a potent, uncompromising and de-romanticized portrait of the gangster life
1.0 <|###|> Scarface is unquestionably one of the greatest talking American movies ever made, and has been terribly underrated all through this century.
1.0 <|###|> One of Hawks's undisputed masterpieces, and a landmark in the screen depiction of gangsters.
0.875 <|###|> Convoluted but absorbing.
0.8 <|###|> A thoroughly enjoyable murder mystery in the classic style.
1.0 <|###|> The Central Park Five," the second best documentary of 2013, examines the case, placing in perfect context of what was happening in 1989 in NYC and how it led to evil both in Central Park and in the offices of the people trying to keep us safe.
0.875 <|###|> Like the "Paradise Lost" films, it's a shocking but clear-eyed portrait of injustice.
0.8300000000000001 <|###|> The Central Park Five is such a moving piece of work, it is difficult to watch at times.
0.75 <|###|> Expect your blood pressure to rise during The Central Park Five.
1.0 <|###|> Burns and company conduct a thorough, riveting investigation that does a far better job of assessing the tragedy than the justice system did two decades before. Of course, hindsight is an advantage we all take for granted.
1.0 <|###|> A heartbreaking expose' about a rush to judgment which ruined five, innocent young lives.
1.0 <|###|> Exclusive interviews with former heads of Israel's counter terrorism agency reveal insiders' analysis about the country's policies. Fascinating. Frightening.
0.75 <|###|> How could this second crime have occurred? The film asks that question but only partly answers it, and in the process it raises an even more troubling one.
0.75 <|###|> "The Central Park Five" is worth seeing, both for the ways it's timeless and for the ways it encapsulates an era.
0.875 <|###|> What's amazing about listening to them speak now, often through tears, is the absence of bitterness.
0.8 <|###|> You'll notice something odd as you watch and your anger rises at the injustice of it all: The anger of the wrongly convicted does not.
0.75 <|###|> What keeps the film from being an impossible downer is the guts and spirit and smart words of the Central Park Five, four of whom, now freed, are interviewed at length.
0.875 <|###|> At times, this is a devastating film, one that acknowledges the desire for but refuses to buy into an easy answer.
0.75 <|###|> Among all of the case's horrors, one of the strongest is that a serial rapist ultimately cared more about the truth than the prosecution.
0.875 <|###|> An unusually good documentary about an outlandish miscarriage of justice.
0.875 <|###|> Involves a detailed reconstruction of how the story broke, was developed and was dramatized by lurid tabloid headlines.
0.8 <|###|> A wonderfully vital, illuminating study of the New York of 20-plus years ago.
0.5 <|###|> ... a respectable but often tedious film that adds little to what is already well known about this episode
0.8 <|###|> A careful, thoughtful documentary that meticulously re-creates what happened on that night and details how and why everything went so terribly off-course.
0.625 <|###|> A skillfully told and important story, though less factual blow-by-blow and more time spent with the five would have been more compelling.
0.75 <|###|> Even as "The Central Park Five" seeks satisfactory answers, it stirs outrage and discouragement all over again.
0.875 <|###|> It's still chilling to see how easily "The Central Park Five" evokes those mad days of urban distrust.
1.0 <|###|> Superb production with memorable Sinise performance in title role.
0.8 <|###|> An excellent biopic anchored by a marvelous job by Sinise.
0.6 <|###|> Its Cliffs Notes approach to the source biography gets a big boost from star Gary Sinise.
0.4 <|###|> Unbelievably lazy.
0.2 <|###|> By the end of Gone you'll be convinced that it's just a low-rent reworking of The Silence of the Lambs, with Seyfried's humongous peepers a sad substitute for Jodie Foster's acting chops.
0.4 <|###|> Seyfried shows she's not the kind of actress who would be an easy victim in a Scream movie.
0.4 <|###|> It's one of those Hollywood movies that goes in one eye and out the other.
0.6 <|###|> It's daffy, but it works.
0.4 <|###|> Despite Seyfried's suitably wide-eyed performance, director Heitor Dhalia holds too loose a grip on the suspense, driving the film into a succession of dramatic dead ends.
0.4 <|###|> Just very silly.
0.3 <|###|> Another squandering of Amanda Seyfried's talent, this low-mileage thriller won't be remembered for long.
0.4 <|###|> Gone and soon forgotten.
0.2 <|###|> Everything about 'Gone' has the plasticy, leatherette feel of an imitation thriller.
0.4 <|###|> The shortfall of suspense is emphasised with every pointless car chase, head-slapping contrivance, and attempt at tongue-in-cheekiness. This movie can seriously damage your IQ.
0.4 <|###|> A psychological thriller lacking in both psychological complexity and thrills.
0.25 <|###|> A frequently disastrous piece of work...
0.4 <|###|> ... far-fetched, devoid of surprises ...
0.5 <|###|> Just try not to hold the characters' behavior to any standard of the actual humans you may have crossed paths with in your life, and everything is fine.
0.1 <|###|> I'd say Gone is a shoo-in for one of the worst movies of 2012, except no one will remember it even existed by December.
0.6 <|###|> It's fun watching Seyfried bluffing and conning her way through scene after scene; no opponent can best her.
0.5 <|###|> Gone wasn't screened in advance for critics and opened to a desultory $4.8 million gross. Anybody interested in seeing it better head to the theater posthaste, because after a couple more weeks, this mediocre effort is sure to be gone, baby, gone.
0.25 <|###|> So lame the only scare during the first hour is the old cat-jumping-into-frame trick.
0.5 <|###|> Put this on Lifetime and it might find an audience, but on the big screen nobody cares
0.1 <|###|> There's little to recommend this B-grade, formulaic affair. The plot is tosh, the dialogue hackneyed at best.
0.25 <|###|> Gifted and sincere as she always is, there's not much Ms. Seyfried can do with this tripe.
0.5 <|###|> It's a significant letdown that after all Jill's running, and all the guessing Seyfried makes us do, the climactic confrontation plays like an uninspired afterthought.
0.4 <|###|> The only thing worthwhile is seeing Portland (the filming location) on the big screen. It proves this landscape would be good for a thriller/horror, just not this one.
0.2 <|###|> A movie that makes "Murder on the Orient Express" feel like"The Silence of the Lambs"by comparison.
0.2 <|###|> Siblings aren't the only things missing from Gone: Suspense, scares and common sense are all likewise MIA.
0.4 <|###|> ...suspension of disbelief seems damn near impossible.
0.375 <|###|> ... a minor entry in the Kiss the Girls/Along Came a Spider line ... Seyfried isn't the least bit convincing in a role that called for hysteria cut with outrage. She manages little-girl peevishness.
0.375 <|###|> It lies there flapping like a dying fish. Skip it.
0.125 <|###|> Imagine Tyler Perry directing the lamest remake of Kiss the Girls imaginable and you can get a sense of how flat-out awful the storytelling and character development is in this one.
0.375 <|###|> Nearly a year has passed since the release of Catherine Hardwicke's Red Riding Hood, and Amanda Seyfried is still crying wolf.
0.3 <|###|> Ms. Seyfried belongs to a stable of blank-faced, saucer-eyed beauties whose limited appeal may conquer the small screen but so far has failed to tame the large.
0.25 <|###|> While Gone has some visual style, the cheap and melodramatic script fails to make it to the party.
0.6 <|###|> I could not decide whether it was absolute garbage or a work of sheer genius.
0.3 <|###|> The title refers to your 12 bucks. This movie is as amateurish as Amanda Seyfried is pretty.
0.3 <|###|> nothing but schlock
0.6 <|###|> The further adventures of immigrant mice.
0.6 <|###|> What can you say about a sequel that comes five years later and yet feels rushed?
0.5 <|###|> Our sweet little Fievel has been stricken with a case of sequelitis ... but it's not too bad.
0.6 <|###|> Funny and intelligent, despite some flaws.
0.8 <|###|> Garofalo is accessible to anyone in the audience (except maybe herself).
0.8 <|###|> Rom-com charmer with a smart script and Garofalo in top form.
0.875 <|###|> Janeane Garofalo's magnetic yet unconventional presence instantly pulls the audience into the story.
0.6 <|###|> Better than it looks ... but not by much.
0.8 <|###|> Since when is Garofalo less appealing than Thurman?
0.8 <|###|> A spry and perceptive romantic comedy highlighted by the spirited performance of Garofalo's self-deprecating guise
0.6 <|###|> This sly update on Cyrano de Bergerac owes a lot to Janeane Garofalo, who inexplicably disowned it.
0.6 <|###|> Sometimes sad, sometimes uplifting. This is a heady meditation on the trials of modern romance.
0.625 <|###|> Though its romantic-comedy triangle borrows heavily from Cyrano de Bergerac, the film has more in common with Three's Company.
0.6 <|###|> Unnecessary sequel is nonetheless entertaining; Roddy Mcdowall back in simian shape.
0.5 <|###|> Aside from Severn Darden, who relishes his lip-smacking heavy character, the cast seems disinterested; even series stalwart Roddy McDowall looks bored.
0.8 <|###|> An okay finale.
0.8 <|###|> surprisingly entertaining
0.5 <|###|> Battle looks like the last gap of a dying series, a movie made simply to wring the dollars out of any remaining ape fans.
0.1 <|###|> The bluntest, cheapest and worst of the 'Apes' movies.
0.8 <|###|> Schmaltzy doesn't get much better...
0.4 <|###|> The battle was lost several movies earlier.
0.6 <|###|> Fans will enjoy it, but the "Apes" gang could have done a little better. Not surprisingly, this was the fifth and last installment. (Unless you count the TV show...)
0.2 <|###|> At least it is only 83 minutes long.
0.4 <|###|> The Planet of the Apes series started well, and gradually decreased in budget and quality. By Battle the budget is all but gone, and all the believability and excitement has gone with it.
0.625 <|###|> The only film in the series to end on a positive note.
0.25 <|###|> [For] completists only and definitely counts as the worst in the entire series.
0.8 <|###|> The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, featuring his heroic man-and-dog duo, Wallace and Gromit, is Park at his sublimely silly best.
0.8 <|###|> Park and co have shaped a wonderfully warm and fuzzy family adventure out of old horror clichA (C)s.
0.8 <|###|> Instead of vainly pursuing today's latest trends, only to see them turn into tomorrow's embarrassments, Park and co. fall back on the values of the past, preferring substance and craft to the fleetingly voguish.
1.0 <|###|> It's a one-joke premise, but part of Nick Park's madness/genius is the skill and detail with which he approaches it.
0.75 <|###|> With Were-Rabbit, Mr. Park establishes Gromit as the best animated canine character since Snoopy.
0.875 <|###|> Full of the British wit and kinetic action-movie thrills that have made Nick Park's cartoons so popular.
0.625 <|###|> ...cute and pleasant (yet essentially forgettable)...
0.7 <|###|> click to read review [Greek]
0.4 <|###|> It's a surprising misstep from the people who gave us Chicken Run.
1.0 <|###|> The comedy is never indulged at the expense of the plot, which flies off in genuinely unexpected directions, culminating in a boundlessly inventive funfair chase sequence.
0.8 <|###|> I don't see how anyone who enjoys their animated movies won't enjoy all of this one.
0.9 <|###|> Gromit...could teach ninety percent of the actors working today something. He can say more in a glance than most actors can using their entire range of tools.
0.875 <|###|> Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is an inventive pseudo-thriller in the Claymation style.
0.8 <|###|> An unqualified success.
1.0 <|###|> This might be Plasticine's finest hour.
1.0 <|###|> Taken as a whole, this is a superb film and an astonishing technical achievement.
0.7 <|###|> The script this time is really better than the animation and the result is genuinely funny. This is an animated film, but it aims to please the whole family and its aim is good.
0.9 <|###|> [Not] merely one of the best animated films of the year; it's the best, and further, ranks among 2005's most satisfying cinematic experiences.
0.8 <|###|> A delight for the kids and well set to take classic status.
0.9 <|###|> Cheeky and inventive, it's the perfect Halloween movie for the kids! Or as they say, it's the world's first vegetarian horror movie.
0.875 <|###|> It doesn't feel produced; it feels made.
0.875 <|###|> It deserves to be the biggest thing in animated features since Shrek and quite possibly Toy Story.
0.7 <|###|> The first two acts of the movie are actually solid, filled with vintage W&G moments as well as some stunning animation.
0.8 <|###|> It's a ripping good yarn, to boot, breathlessly paced and seamlessly edited, but most important, resoundingly and surpassingly fun.
0.8 <|###|> Park and Box make this 85 minute film feel like a half hour with its quick moving plot line, making it perfect for children.
0.8 <|###|> It is suitable for any child who can follow a complicated story -- although there are some scary bits -- and it is equally appealing to the child hiding in any adult.
0.875 <|###|> There is something indescribably satisfying about the vaguely off-kilter world of Wallace and Gromit and its litany of details.
0.75 <|###|> There's none of the Hollywood cynicism or too-clever winks meant to instill a sense of exclusive superiority, just a sincere celebration of what makes good filmmaking and a desire to entertain.
0.8 <|###|> It is funny, exciting, and it's a fantastic piece of animation.
0.6 <|###|> Go for the beginning and the end and try to endure the middle.
0.9 <|###|> A polarizing, but classic piece of children's entertainment filled with whimsy, horror, comedy and imagination.
1.0 <|###|> This is Gene Wilder's legacy. He was perfect for the role, and it was his mixture of childlike wonder and bitter, deserved vengeance that made the character so compelling.
1.0 <|###|> Pure, sweet imagination for both kids and adults.
0.5 <|###|> The passages in the mysterious factory, which should be Charlie's and our release from the oppression of the earlier scenes, are just as ugly as everything that's come before, so there's no contrast.
0.8 <|###|> ...filled with good humor, good acting, and good songs...and it's just off kilter enough to keep everyone's attention.
1.0 <|###|> Ainda que um ou outro numero musical comprometa o ritmo, o clima de fantasia e a atuacao calorosa de Wilder conquistam o espectador.
1.0 <|###|> The movie bursts with creativity, deep thought and comedy.
0.8 <|###|> Probably Gene Wilder's finest, most manic hour.
1.0 <|###|> Weird and wonderful
1.0 <|###|> Just a frolicking Wonka visionary schnozberry flavored delight!
0.6 <|###|> It has a huge following, though I've never understood why.
0.6 <|###|> If "creepy" can be an asset, then this is the best kind of creepy you'll ever find.
0.87 <|###|> A timeless family film that will continue to endure as long as people love chocolate.
1.0 <|###|> The original feel good film from 1971, is back in a special new DVD edition for its thirtieth anniversary with some great special features.
1.0 <|###|> Brings joy to adult and child alike.
0.75 <|###|> The zany factory's imaginative gimmicks, and that vivid color scheme, will keep even the youngest kids alert.
0.8 <|###|> Cynical and raunchy comedy for adults only.
0.5 <|###|> Unfortunately, the tender observations Zwigoff and Clowes specialize in are largely missing from Art School Confidential, which spends its energy on the zany people who'd usually pepper the edges of their films.
0.5 <|###|> It's too crass to be a plausible satire, and not funny enough to be a dumb comedy.
0.8 <|###|> It's the work of two misanthropes in an even worse mood than usual.
1.0 <|###|> An ingenious satire of the pretentious mindset of the elitist art world from the perspective of a rapidly-disillusioned kid who had no idea what he was getting into.
0.625 <|###|> ...generally comes off as nothing less than a substantial disappointment.
0.5 <|###|> The few characters we might have cared for become increasingly shallow, and it all lapses into cliches about the relationship between art and infamy, between personal integrity and selling your soul, and so on.
0.4 <|###|> The true merit of the movie is the momentary pleasures of the dialogue and the performances, but the story itself leaves you wanting. So, is it art? Looks like it.
0.375 <|###|> Has the makings of a mediocre, after-school sitcom
0.7 <|###|> Art School Confidential s'avere une autre belle reussite pour les deux artistes [Zwigoff et Clowes] qui, esperons-le, collaboreront a nouveau dans un avenir rapproche.
0.6 <|###|> This smarty-pants campus yarn is on fire with satire.
0.625 <|###|> Director Terry Zwigoff and comic book artist-turned-screenwriter Daniel Clowes follow up their Ghost World success with a less satisfying collaboration.
0.6 <|###|> Ita(TM)s fine that this film feels uncomfortable indulging the shopworn tropes of coming-of-age story or black comedy or romance or mystery thriller, but, well, ambivalence is self-propagating.
0.5 <|###|> Rather than observing the intimate details that make an Art School project special, the filmmakers opt to focus on Art School partying (i.e., drinking and vomiting) instead.
0.6 <|###|> Well-meaning, but ultimately flawed.
0.4 <|###|> This has the feel of a beginner's film and has some fun moments and a good performance by John Malkovich, but overall does not have enough to keep it going.
0.8 <|###|> Zygoff and Clowes do get the most out of their first-rate cast and prove that hollow laughs are far superior to no laughs at all.
0.25 <|###|> In almost any medium, Art School Confidential would draw a failing grade.
0.6 <|###|> It's a sardonic, subversive, heavy-handed black comedy, painting a nasty picture.
0.8 <|###|> Bitter, flawed, a bit sophomoric, but compelling in a way that better balanced cinematic efforts rarely are.
0.625 <|###|> ...a sort of John Hughes revamp of Fritz Lang's 'Scarlet Street' (another film in which sexual desire leads a struggling painter down a path of death and stolen artistic identity).
0.72 <|###|> ...if the lack of chemistry between the leads and the glued-together nature of the plot bring the movie down, they don't totally extinguish its subversive spirit.
0.5 <|###|> "Art School Confidential," compared to Zwigoff's other masterpieces "Ghost World" and "Crumb," is a paint-by-numbers picture.
0.5 <|###|> If you're an art student, you'll probably buy the movie on DVD and rub it all over your body.
0.875 <|###|> Their humor comes not from a need to be loved or a need to win awards, but rather straight from an acute awareness of the world's follies.
0.75 <|###|> No matter which is the real imitator, life or art, Art School Confidential does its own fine job skewering both.
0.5 <|###|> The film loses its way with multiple subplots, becoming a hodgepodge that isn't particularly hard to follow, but, far worse, provides no compelling reason to bother.
0.5 <|###|> The movie has no supportive theme or rhythm, nothing to bind its dotty patches together.
0.4 <|###|> This tale of a naive young student who is thrown to the arrogant wolves at an art school comes off as both insecure and insincere. I often didn't believe it, and I wasn't sure the creators really believed it either.
0.4 <|###|> A movie with the odd, tired joke about art and artists, a college romance that isn't romantic, and a plot twist that doesn't twist at all.
0.5 <|###|> It feels deflated, disgruntled and pathetic.
0.5 <|###|> The film is so busy working hard to convict one rather shady character, it never convinces us of its own reason to exist.
0.3 <|###|> The acting occasionally borders on great. The story itself is more than worthy. But none of that comes close to overcoming the misguided pacing and overall lack of depth.
0.7 <|###|> A somewhat flawed yet ultimately satisfying thriller.
0.4 <|###|> A story that's overloaded with research and unbridled speculation, all told with no clear direction.
0.75 <|###|> The end result is intriguing, with a dash of a love story here and a twisty whodunit there. A fine performance by Ryan Gosling glues the mishmash together.
0.6 <|###|> All Good Things isn't a pleasurable film to experience, but it offers an uncanny evocation of a narcissistic sociopath who doesn't come at us with the charm and sophistication that the typical screen bad guy has.
0.75 <|###|> All Good Things is a crackerjack crime thriller.
0.3 <|###|> Ryan Gosling is sadly miscast as the villain in this poorly-written drama.
0.625 <|###|> Jarecki never settles on what kind of story he wants to tell with these elements, and despite good performances, "All Good Things" veers awkwardly from love story to tragedy, from true-life mystery to black comedy.
0.5 <|###|> There's a fascinating story here for a bolder filmmaker, but after so much meandering it's a relief that All Good Things must come to an end.
0.625 <|###|> One can't help but think that veteran documentarian Jarecki chose to rework this material as drama to benefit his career, not the story. The result is a disjointed art film that opts for ambiguity over clarity...
0.5 <|###|> Jarecki knows how to make scenes of boisterous family reunions and quiet moments between lovers engaging: He fares less well, though, when the story takes a dark turn.
0.84 <|###|> ...a movie suspended between bold novelistic invention and journalistic reserve. Be it demerit or credit, Jarecki is no Truman Capote and All Good Things is no In Cold Blood.
0.625 <|###|> Dunst shines brightly and puts on an acting showcase worthy of awards recognition in the supporting actress category. The picture loses its luster when her character disappears.
0.625 <|###|> All Good Things is curiously underwhelming.
0.6 <|###|> While the acting is superb and the film worth viewing, in this odd straddle between fact and fiction, the filmmakers miss the chance to bring more fictive power to the tale.
0.25 <|###|> a rather meticulously-detailed period piece that fails almost completely to offer up any human interest in its pursuit of human truth.
0.625 <|###|> It also feels like one man's attempt to try another in the court of cinema, or perhaps correct the course of justice itself.
0.3 <|###|> Beset with a series of miscalculated dramatic misfires, the film is a melodramatic adaptation of a tabloid-style 20/20 murder-mystery, wearyingly overstuffed with baroque detail in an effort to prop up its legitimacy.
0.625 <|###|> In his first fictional feature, [Jarecki ] can't decide whether to opt for the open-ended inquiry of a non-fiction film or the resolved storytelling of Hollywood genre movie, so he winds up stranded in between.
0.625 <|###|> The second half is at once unconventional and straightforward -- the former because of the actual content, the latter in terms of structure in which it's presented.
0.5 <|###|> Gosling and co-stars Kirsten Dunst and Frank Langella don't do anything wrong here but the movie is such a mash-up of tones, fiction, and reality that it never comes together into anything coherent.
0.875 <|###|> Kirsten Dunst is so good here as a woman at a loss to understand who her husband really is, and what the true nature of his family involves.
0.6 <|###|> Too bad it's not a doc, which might have revealed the secrecy and confusion that led to such a legendary case remaining unsolved.
0.5 <|###|> You never feel you can trust that Jarecki knows what he's doing, which becomes even more problematic when the movie asks us to believe its theory about an unsolved crime.
0.75 <|###|> "All Good Things" has the eerie power of a nightmare.
0.75 <|###|> As excellent as Gosling is - and the actor conveys the stillness of the man as well as the voices screaming in his head - Dunst matches him stride for stride.
0.75 <|###|> It's a strange, thrilling tale begrimed by bad memories, by bad deeds.
0.5 <|###|> full review at Movies for the Masses
0.5 <|###|> Dunst is not the only person doing quality work in "All Good Things," but she is the only one worth watching.
0.625 <|###|> You watch it wanting to scurry off to read accounts of the real thing, rather than being caught up in the filmmaking.
0.625 <|###|> beneath the surface are all kinds of questions about power and wealth and the cyclical nature of familial tragedy, and while they break through from time to time, it is never enough to give the film more depth than a TrueTV documentary
0.8 <|###|> A fast paced, highly intelligent, endlessly enjoyable matinee joyride.
0.75 <|###|> Fascinating study of criminal justice in the crumbling Nazi empire of 1944.
0.5 <|###|> It crouches but -- alas -- never springs.
0.7 <|###|> It is so gloriously unconvincing, so utterly absurd, that it achieves a kind of greatness.
0.0 <|###|> A sure candidate for the worst movie ever made...
0.625 <|###|> ...unabashed fantasy...
0.8 <|###|> I LOVE this movie. Bad sequels take away from the original.
0.6 <|###|> Surprisingly not-awful cable-flick action-fest!
0.6 <|###|> Whatever the political undercurrent at work, every so often you have to remind yourself that this happened to four young men, no doubt the brightest stars of loving families.
0.8 <|###|> Peter Berg is effectively offering four Rambos for the price of one - the Seals' bullet-whistling gunfight scenes are a combination of Saving Private Ryan on a ridge, Heat on a hill and Open Range out in the open. Bang, bang, bang! And bang again!
0.4 <|###|> Lone Survivor comes off as a celebration of the martyred American soldier, that myth that makes it that much easier for old men to send young men to their deaths.
0.625 <|###|> Knowing the outcome tends to lessen the intensity of the well-shot action sequences.
0.6 <|###|> Encontra seus melhores momentos em suas sequencias de acao.
0.6 <|###|> Lone Survivor is a proficiently-made film with plenty to enjoy, but truly embracing it is difficult outside of an American context.
0.6 <|###|> Lone Survivor is a proficiently-made film with plenty to enjoy, but truly embracing it is difficult outside of an American context.
0.7 <|###|> The most harrowing combat film since Saving Private Ryan.
0.6 <|###|> Small in scale but just as intense, Lone Survivor's extended battle recalls the opening of Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. like its hardy protagonists, is determined to get the job done.
0.8 <|###|> If there's one major message at the core of Peter Berg's outstanding, realistic, fact-based war film it's that no amount of new-fangled military technology can take away from the brutality and human cost of frontline fighting.
1.0 <|###|> If Mark Wahlberg stars as an interesting character, the movie has a fighting chance at the box office - and this one became a hit.
0.6 <|###|> It will be remembered for its bone-breaking, blood-splattering, white-knuckle skirmish - not for its performances, characters, plot or dialogue. On this level, it works.
0.7 <|###|> For all its flaws it is both a gripping action thriller and an unforgettable depiction of the cold realities of war. My first reaction after seeing it was a simple one: this must be how it was. It may be the highest tribute I can pay.
0.5 <|###|> ...a disappointing, underwhelming actioner from Peter Berg...
0.7 <|###|> A portrayal of strict military excellence and grueling physical performances, to which Mark Wahlberg brings his best game.
0.8 <|###|> Captures the raw intensity of combat and carnage on both sides of the battlefront, and the heroics that forge an indelible spirit in combat
0.6 <|###|> Lone Survivor sticks pretty closely to the facts, has real momentum and a series of impressive action sequences
0.6 <|###|> While the violence is horrifying, the encasing narrative is perversely "heroic", with corn-fed dialogue presented as solidly non-ironic, and images of the real-life combatants used to stirring, manipulative ends.
0.6 <|###|> An occasionally smart script - and four excellent actors - keep the project grounded.
0.8 <|###|> Lone Survivor does a magnificent job of making disorder intelligible. It's not a very nice film. But it is a splendidly effective one.
0.8 <|###|> Lone Survivor does a magnificent job of making disorder intelligible. It's not a very nice film. But it is a splendidly effective one.
0.4 <|###|> The relentless intensity quickly grows numbing.
0.4 <|###|> Replete with a certain kind of self-importance and self-forgiveness, this Afghan war movie starring Mark Wahlberg has a distinctively martyred America-at-bay feel.
0.8 <|###|> There are nuggets of honesty amid the gung-ho jingoism in Peter Berg's starry-eyed war story.
0.8 <|###|> The picture may not be in contention for Oscars but it's a first-class modern war film: visceral, exciting and thought-provoking.
0.6 <|###|> The film alternates between the pulverisingly immediate and dismayingly generic.
0.6 <|###|> [The second act] is the core of the film, and it works very well. What falls on either side has been designed to support it, but comes close to achieving the opposite.
0.4 <|###|> Lone Survivor is well made and well acted but its refusal to pass comment on the central mission means that it ultimately feels like a gung ho fantasy that lacks emotional impact.
0.8 <|###|> Luttrell's remarkable story of survival is worth telling. Inevitably, the temptation to depict US military as consummate heroes creeps through. Yet it's a more balanced account than you might expect.
0.75 <|###|> nothing if not a deeply felt paean to the characters' toughness, bravery, and, most importantly, humanity
0.8 <|###|> Berg reconstructs the gunfight brilliantly. Superb stunts, a dizzying use of handheld cameras, great editing and brilliant acting combine to make this the most intense war movie since Black Hawk Down.
0.6 <|###|> Lone Survivor isn't always sophisticated ... But there's moral complexity and a climax in an Afghan village which is tense and surprisingly moving.
0.6 <|###|> A severe portrait of fortitude under extreme pressure, somewhat marred by blinkered politics.
0.6 <|###|> Mark Wahlberg stands firm as Luttrell and he also produced this version of events which, ultimately, celebrates the brotherhood of soldiers and hits hard, on a gut level.
0.6 <|###|> The direction pummels and the cast impress, yet Berg's war movie promises more than it delivers.
0.75 <|###|> A noble, moving tribute.
0.7 <|###|> Lone Survivor' hits home and hits hard.
0.625 <|###|> The film shows us the landscape of modern warfare, which when it is men with guns facing each other is pretty much the way war has been in the trenches since the Civil War.
1.0 <|###|> Fantastic hip-hop documentary has profanity, some drug use.
0.6 <|###|> It's an insider's celebration of the form, studded with straight-to-camera rhymesmithery from its best practitioners.
0.8 <|###|> All fascinating stuff if a little repetitive and rambling but definitely one for fans.
0.6 <|###|> It's hard not to like a film so in love with its subject matter, or boasting such an incredible soundtrack.
0.8 <|###|> The film is educative, entertaining, in almost all senses a blast. Your body is left in your seat while your soul is blown to the back of the auditorium.
0.6 <|###|> Preaching to the choir, but that's no bad thing.
0.6 <|###|> Watchable documentary that showcases some impressive a cappella rap performances and provides the occasional amusing anecdote...
0.8 <|###|> A very enjoyable and often fascinating movie.
0.6 <|###|> There's no faulting the lyrical excellence on display. These guys are legends for a reason.
0.8 <|###|> An extremely interesting insight, proving that rap music is an art form in its own right.
0.8 <|###|> It's likely to be fascinating if you are a hip hop fan, but almost wilfully unilluminating if you aren't.
0.6 <|###|> Freestyle, funny but finally just too repetitive, Ice's affectionate home-movie needed someone to structure it into a deeper documentary.
0.75 <|###|> Hardly definitive (where's Houston and Memphis, and why are MC Lyte and Salt the only females represented?), the movie is nonetheless fascinating for fans, as rappers break down their writing techniques for Ice-T's cameras.
0.75 <|###|> Essential viewing and a nice companion piece to "Wild Style," "Style Wars" and other key hip-hop documentaries.
0.625 <|###|> In his debut as a documentarian, Ice T creates a vibrant portrait of how and why rap came to be.
0.7 <|###|> This is a film that does sweat the technique, with at times illuminating and spirited results.
0.625 <|###|> The interviews are often revealing and funny. And much of the music is tremendous.
0.6 <|###|> The faces and voices are endlessly compelling as they talk about what inspires them to lay down beats and recall the early days in New York.
0.6 <|###|> There's a discipline to moviemaking, too, alas, and when this effort strays from its (admittedly limited) subject to a surfeit of helicopter city shots and Ice's street prowling, it feels padded.
0.875 <|###|> Untethered to any post-TV era is a conclusion that America gets too comfortable with the mental inactivity it enables. Edward R. Murrow's titular signoff begins as a trademark and ends as a challenge to a medium - one too often unmet today.
0.8 <|###|> Provocative, principled and richly detailed, this is compelling stuff. Emotionally ita(TM)s a little dry, but as brain-food, ita(TM)s absolutely invigorating. George done good.
0.8 <|###|> Scrupulously journalistic, sometimes to its credit, sometimes to its deficit as a movie.
1.0 <|###|> Good Night is not your average historical recreation. It doesn't dumb-down its story or its characters with needless explanation for the benefit of an under-educated audience.
0.8 <|###|> proves that it is still possible in the cinema, if not in television, to inform without being boring and entertain without condescending.
0.4 <|###|> bez obzira na plemenite namjere svojih tvoraca, ipak ne zaslu%u017Euje "Oscara", jer je iznevjerio visoke standarde objektivnosti koje pripisuje svom junaku.
0.875 <|###|> ... a timely reminder of the consequences of failing to balance national security with personal liberties... (believability is) what really comes through on the screen...
0.875 <|###|> David Strathairn is terrific and with George Clooney's passion for his subject, they make [i]Good Night[/i] a satisfying comparison between the past and the present.
0.875 <|###|> Many will see it as a cautionary tale: Don't let anyone else do your thinking for you. The truth is the thing. Cherish it and defend it.
0.625 <|###|> more interested using the movie medium as a pulpit from which to pontificate...political beliefs rather than in telling a dramatically engaging story
0.6 <|###|> Strathairn's performance is uncanny, and the 1950s period detail is spot-on.
0.9 <|###|> Today, history records Edward R. Murrow as a towering journalist and Senator McCarthy as a sniveling tyrant. Don't you love it when history gets it right.
1.0 <|###|> One of this year's most powerful films.
0.6 <|###|> It is all outstandingly performed and photographed.
0.8 <|###|> George Clooney is emerging as one of America's bravest, boldest filmmakers. And with this highly-charged political thriller, he's also emerging as one of its very best.
0.6 <|###|> If you enjoy that sort of thing, this one makes its points, short and sweet, and looks good, while doing so.
0.6 <|###|> Un valioso testimonio sobre una epoca controversial (con inquietantes referencias a la actual politica de Estados Unidos), filmado en extraordinario blanco y negro y con estupenda labor de David Strathairn.
0.6 <|###|> A clever, quietly spoken little movie and a great pleasure to watch.
0.75 <|###|> An admirable film; it tells an important story, and it's stoked with obvious conviction.
0.8 <|###|> Methodically and purposefully demonstrates the importance of impartial journalism.
0.8 <|###|> ... mais do que um filme interessante e eficiente; e uma licao civica como aquelas que o proprio Murrow se encarregava de ministrar em seu programa.
0.9 <|###|> The film slowly draws the audience into the drama with utter conviction.
0.875 <|###|> one of the most thoughtful, impassioned and best films of the year.
0.8 <|###|> Strathairn gives a sly, quiet, unfussy performance as Murrow that sneaks up on you.
0.8 <|###|> An admirable piece of work that takes a bold stand -- not just against events of the past, but events of the present. Hopefully, in the process, it can save the future.
0.75 <|###|> When Murrow cautions viewers they should 'not be driven by fear into an age of unreason,' the film seems more culturally relevant than anything playing at the multiplex.
0.75 <|###|> Dense, direct and digression-free.
0.75 <|###|> The movie takes us back to the time when TV was at its infancy, but already marching towards its inevitable position as America's favorite waste of time ...
1.0 <|###|> While the harmfulness of McCarthyism is a significant part of the film, it approaches the subject by examining the power of the media.
1.0 <|###|> The use of the archival footage -- and director George Clooney's willingness to let it play out -- imbues the film with a historical heft that is more than a little unnerving.
0.8 <|###|> George Clooney's second film as a director is a sharply scripted film with a terrific central performance from David Strathairn and a message that has lost none of its relevance in the last 50 years.
0.875 <|###|> George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck has the visual feel of a chamber drama, with the majority of its action taking place in a handful of offices in the CBS building in New York, but the emotional gravitas of a morality play.
0.625 <|###|> ...you might be safe, secure, comfortable, but you will lose something precious, something self-defining, something whose loss will make security feel pointless.
0.3 <|###|> Even with a tiny budget, The Worst Year of My Life has ambition, but limp acting, unoriginal story beats and lifeless characterization mires its scope.
0.8 <|###|> A fascinating exercise in cinematic restraint resulting in a captivating, not to be missed film.
0.8 <|###|> With A History Of Violence, Cronenberg uses the pulp gangster genre - as opposed to, say, sci-fi horror -- to draw us into a dialogue on our relationship as voyeurs to violence, both real and cinematic.
0.875 <|###|> While it weakens in its final stretch...A History of Violence succeeds enormously thanks to the strength of its direction and performances.
0.83 <|###|> The violence that enters the characters' perfect domestic existence is permanent, and each act reveals truths about the people who use it and the audience who enjoys it.
0.7 <|###|> The movie begins slowly, methodically, and builds increasingly toward a devastating climax.
1.0 <|###|> The tension builds in a slow boil, then ignites furiously when we're not quite ready for it.
0.75 <|###|> Mr. Mortensen and the sparse, intelligent script hold it together.
0.6 <|###|> full review in Greek
0.75 <|###|> A strange David Cronenberg movie, and not in the usual audaciously morbid way. A brooding, contemplative picture that's tough, tight and masterfully controlled.
0.6 <|###|> Lo mas reciente del canadiense David Cronenberg es un solido thriller, casi de factura clasica, sobre las ramificaciones de la violencia.
1.0 <|###|> There are elements in this film that are 100% Cronenberg (the beautiful violence we so rarely see these days, subtle weird humor), but this is not your typical Cronenberg
0.8 <|###|> What Mortensen does brilliantly is to keep us guessing.
0.8 <|###|> Tematicamente ambicioso, demonstra ter seguranca suficiente da forca de sua narrativa ao permitir que o espectador saia do cinema sem estar completamente certo de como tudo terminou. E esta talvez seja uma de suas maiores virtudes.
0.7 <|###|> Never does it deviate from Cronenberg's primal instincts.
0.5 <|###|> ... like biting into a sour pickle hidden in the bottom of your ice cream cone... simply fails to deliver what it promises to fulfill another agenda.
0.7 <|###|> Three-fourths of this movie is great, but don't get me started on that ending.
0.5 <|###|> I have mixed feelings. Cool, engaging, well acted (William Hurt is brilliant). But could have used a bit more shaving in the editing room and a bit messy on point.
0.9 <|###|> On the surface, this may seem just a violent gangster yarn, but Cronenberg has opened the door to a train of thought that becomes more disturbing the longer you consider it.
0.75 <|###|> a pretty good little thriller, but clocking in at only 95 minutes, it doesn't have enough meat to be a truly satisfying drama.
0.5 <|###|> [David Cronenberg] no doubt wanted to say something profound about the nature of violence, but his approach betrays his intentions.
1.0 <|###|> Some movies are to be consumed and discarded. History of Violence, a drama of disarming power, is not one of those. This is one of the most stirring films of the year.
0.4 <|###|> Olson should have studied a history of screenwriting before attempting to adapt A History of Violence. One of the most aimless, derivative films to ever be overrated.
1.0 <|###|> A tense, tight and pithy thriller with such superb restraint that almost every detail matters -- and therefore shouldn't be spoiled.
0.875 <|###|> A History of Violence is a fine movie that simply is too intense for many viewers.
0.86 <|###|> This is Sin City with a functioning brain
0.875 <|###|> Cronenberg knows this territory well, drawing parallels between sex, violence, and companionship...in this mature, compelling movie.
1.0 <|###|> Violence is a turn-on, Cronenberg seems to be saying, but a turn-on that comes with a destructively high price.
0.4 <|###|> Tired dud of an over-the top violent action movie.
0.375 <|###|> The plot is such hooey...and the plot holes so gaping that End of Days proves more exasperating than enjoyable. [Blu-Ray]
0.625 <|###|> Never rises to the realm of exciting.
0.8 <|###|> Part of the degraded charm of End of Days is its buffet-table derivative approach.
0.3 <|###|> End of Days isn't complete waste of time but all those who watch it would probably agree that this film's days were numbered long time ago.
0.5 <|###|> A lot of fun, but not a great movie.
0.625 <|###|> Loud, lurid, bloody and ridiculously entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> Um filme de acao incessante que traz Arnold Schwarzenegger em uma das piores atuacoes de sua carreira.
0.375 <|###|> Displaying precisely the imagination that gave the world such epic achievements as The Star Chamber and The Relic, Hyams dusts off America's designated import and goes with Arnie Schwarzenegger his own self.
0.5 <|###|> An effort which will join True Lies and Raw Deal in the dustbin of Schwarzenegger history.
1.0 <|###|> If you liked The Exorcist, The Omen, and Rosemary's Baby , don't miss this one.
0.25 <|###|> Arnold, Arnold, Arnold, what were you thinking when you signed on to do this?
0.6 <|###|> The biggest problem here was the script.
0.5 <|###|> Isn't a bad movie by any means; it's just a reasonably silly one that, in one form or the other, has been overdone to death.
0.5 <|###|> ...a run-of-the-mill supernatural thriller.
0.5 <|###|> Arnie's batteries seem to be losing their juice.
0.4 <|###|> The movie is as bloodless as a cyborg, and it feels as if it has been assembled according to diagrams supplied by someone who studied every successful sci-fi action thriller and then multiplied the findings by 10.
0.6 <|###|> This could be devilish fun, but director / cinematographer Peter Hyams slows the action to a ponderous crawl.
0.2 <|###|> Nothing but groans and yawns.
0.8 <|###|> There is much that is fiercely modest about its ambitions. And, for a war film, it is often disconcertingly quiet.
0.8 <|###|> This is a harrowing picture, made all the more disturbing because it's based in a war that is being waged right now.
0.8 <|###|> An important, intense, nail-biting experience -- really quite unforgettable.
1.0 <|###|> The idea of watching people risking being blown to smithereens might not create a box office blockbuster. But this is certainly director Kathryn Bigelow's best film since Point Break in 1991.
0.8 <|###|> It is visceral filmmaking at its best.
0.8 <|###|> The Hurt Locker is set in present-day Baghdad, but it could be taking place anywhere in the world, at virtually any time in the last century.
0.8 <|###|> It's a film about why some soldiers love war, a theme that's rare in war films made by men.
0.8 <|###|> Bigelow's constantly moving camera, often jittery and restless, does well to convey the tension and latent chaos that bubbles beneath the surface of these soldiers' lives.
1.0 <|###|> It is neither an anti-war film nor a pro-war film. It is, simply, a great war film about courageous men working in chaotic situations, and the collateral damage that comes with the job.
0.8 <|###|> This is a film that doesn't distract with big self-aggrandizing political statements, but nevertheless succeeds in nailing the horror of the war.
0.8 <|###|> The Hurt Locker transcends the political slop surrounding Iraq and cuts straight to the bone, letting us touch the hard, bloody reality of war without casualties of cliche or naive acts of emotional heroism.
0.8 <|###|> Bigelow, one of the very few women working in the traditionally male-dominated action and war genres, avoids both red wire/yellow wire cliche and political preaching to deliver a film that is as psychologically fascinating as it is taut and exciting.
1.0 <|###|> When the picture isn't ramping up your heart rate, it switches gears and becomes an intimate character study in what war does to humankind.
0.8 <|###|> It's in refusing to plant a flag on one side or the other over the Iraq war debacle that Bigelow may just have made the conflict's defining film: words are cheap, but it's action that matters.
0.75 <|###|> I wasn't exactly blown away by it (no pun intended here at all), but it remains an engaging film. There's certainly a great story to be told in here somewhere, it's just not the great film I've been hearing about.
0.6 <|###|> It's not delicate by any means, and it gives an intense look into the lives of the American soldiers in Iraq.
0.8 <|###|> The suspense may just kill you.
0.9 <|###|> Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is one of the most thrilling action films I've seen in the past few years. It features set piece after pulse-quickening set piece.
1.0 <|###|> The decade's best fictional film about its real war, it's a unique perspective on the workplace high of delivering containment from chaos. Some people kick PowerPoint's ass. Sgt. 1st Class William James saves his by defusing bombs.
0.8 <|###|> Bigelow does not stint on portraying war's brutality, but the focus is strictly on the individual, not on the bigger picture, and the overall effect is more powerful and devastating for it.
0.96 <|###|> Equal parts bravado-fueled action and pointed political statement. The best film yet made about the Iraq War, and the best American film about war since Platoon.
1.0 <|###|> One of the few must watches of the year so far, and certainly one of the most intelligent offerings, The Hurt Locker would likely already be boasting a masterpiece label had it been from a high profile director or studio.
0.8 <|###|> Combines white- knuckle tension, sizzling dialogue and poignant insight into the lives of the bravest guys in Baghdad.
0.875 <|###|> A tense, occasionally meandering story about bomb defusers in Iraq.
0.9 <|###|> Succeeds where so many others have failed, by crafting a compelling Iraq war film.
0.6 <|###|> OK slapstick in the "Home Alone" vein
0.2 <|###|> Hey, at least the baby wasn't talking.
0.6 <|###|> Tot-sized laughs
0.2 <|###|> For the seven people out there who hoped for a movie stupider than "Home Alone 2."
0.625 <|###|> Not nearly as awful as it could have been...it at least knows that it's cheesy, which makes it more fun.
0.4 <|###|> It's not really clear why this movie was necessary %u2013 it does not reinvent the 50's movie so much as do a highly faithful cover version of it. (Gus Van Sandy's shot-for-shot remake of Psycho is a similar pointless academic exercise.)
0.625 <|###|> ...gently wacky. Although breezy and sketchy on the easy laughs at times, Alien Trespass does promise to entertain for the sole purpose of its campy off-kilter makeup.
0.6 <|###|> If the film succeeds perfectly in its aim, to recreate exactly a genre of films noted for how shoddy and boring they were, is it then fair to complain when the film is itself boring?
0.1 <|###|> Alien Trespass won't let our knowledge of the stereotypes it incorporates do the work and make the critique.
0.6 <|###|> If you're willing to check your brain at the door and to suspend a lot of your disbelief, Alien Trespass manages to be a delightfully zany and campy satire best experienced at midnight with a group of friends.
0.7 <|###|> A true love letter to genre days gone by, Alien Trespass delivers on its promise to bring back a slice of the good old days to horror cinema.
0.75 <|###|> While it never rises to the level of Galaxy Quest, my gold standard for funny sci-fi films, Alien Trespass consistently delights and amuses.
0.4 <|###|> Retro-style sci-fi action spoof tries hard but doesn't work.
0.6 <|###|> A highly entertaining retro Sci-fi blast from the past that is loads of fun, an endearing tribute to all those bad movies we just loved.
0.5 <|###|> ... once those warm, fuzzy feelings of nostalgia start to wear off, all you are left with is a tedious movie that is full of wooden performances, campy dialogue, cheesy and outdated special effects, eerie music and space beings in rubber suits.
0.2 <|###|> This lazy effort gets points only for truly loving -- perhaps to a fault -- the cheapo creature flicks of the 1950s.
0.5 <|###|> Alien Trespass, with a rating notice that mentions 'brief historical smoking,' is at least better than last year's official remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still.
0.375 <|###|> It's a satire without laughs, a parody without punch lines, a careful copy that replicates everything except the original's life.
0.75 <|###|> How much you enjoy this strange picture depends on two things: Your appreciation of the genre that is being feted here, and the enthusiasm of the audience that you view it with.
0.625 <|###|> Alien Trespass is an intriguing experiment, and I admire its craftsmanship.
0.2 <|###|> If you're not going to have fun with such a silly cinematic subgenre, what's the point in resurrecting it? Or, from the more pertinent audience point of view, in seeing it?
0.4 <|###|> A charmingly sentimental but ultimately pointless homage to the sci-fi classics of yesteryear.
0.4 <|###|> Fun at first, the movie quickly wears thin. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but if that's your choice, you better be sure the thing you're imitating is worthy of it.
0.4 <|###|> While Alien Trespass stays true to the era and the genre, it forgets that its mission in this galaxy is not merely to pay tribute but to entertain.
0.5 <|###|> Alien Trespass, which opens Friday on the heels of the witty Monsters vs. Aliens, feels like an also-ran.
0.5 <|###|> Bewildered? You won't be alone.
0.25 <|###|> Alien Trespass, an affectionate tribute to flying saucer movies, treats the cliches of drive-in sci-fi with touching naivete. So why isn't it more fun?
0.5 <|###|> To see how Alien Trespass might have been done, rent The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra with its puppet monster on visible strings, its dime-store sets and its dreadful artificial dialogue.
0.75 <|###|> Alien Trespass could be the latest bulletin from Mystery Science Theatre 3000 except that we're the silhouetted heads and the filmmakers are sitting right there next to us.
0.625 <|###|> At a certain point you find yourself thinking, why not watch the real It Came From Outer Space, instead of this mildly amusing replica?
0.2 <|###|> A pale imitation of a drive-in movie, with nothing silly or sloppy enough to qualify as camp.
0.5 <|###|> The plotting is too obvious, too contrived and too convenient.
0.875 <|###|> Friedrich isn't particularly sharp, but Riemelt's wonderfully nuanced performance gives him intricate layers of feeling.
0.5 <|###|> Nearly every point made in Before the Fall, be it about militarism or the secret sexual codes of fascism, is made too obviously, or has been made before, in films from Cabaret to Europa, Europa.
0.625 <|###|> It asks us to sympathize with teenage boys being groomed for National Socialist glory, and for that reason alone, it absorbs.
0.75 <|###|> ... hooks you by focusing on Friedrich's very human story.
0.5 <|###|> One senses that Gansel took the most egregious stories from his research and stuffed them all into the shapeless script.
0.5 <|###|> The film is a competent but callow work dealing with a monstrous subject that automatically rejects callowness.
0.625 <|###|> The best thing about Gansel's film is it doesn't ask you to absolve anyone; it only tries to make everyone a little more human.
0.625 <|###|> Gansel and his screenwriting partner, Maggie Gansel, bring not a whiff of fresh nor penetrating insight to these subjects.
0.9 <|###|> A work of exemplary craftsmanship, crisp and forthright yet modulated by subtle nuances, Before the Fall ranks high among the year's films.
0.7 <|###|> While the background of the story is fascinating and enlightening, the foreground story could be more complex and original. The plot is a good story whose arc is a little overly familiar. Still the production values are high and the story is compelling.
0.75 <|###|> The movie's own moral stance is above reproach, and the two leads are engaged enough to make you care about the outcome.
0.8 <|###|> Bankrupt fascist politics and a talent in the ring combine to force decisions no teenager should have to make.
0.75 <|###|> It's a handsomely mounted production that benefits greatly from location shooting and sharp attention to historical detail.
0.75 <|###|> The acting is believable; the photography, atmospheric; and the moral, unmistakable.
0.625 <|###|> Nazis were once innocent children -- that, at least, is the notion behind Dennis Gansel's overcooked wartime drama about the ill-fated friendship between two teenage boys at a training school for elite German military recruits.
0.5 <|###|> Though well-made, Before the Fall never really comes to cinematic life.
0.4 <|###|> I guarantee you nothing this cheesy happened during World War I.
0.8 <|###|> Set in Berlin in 1942, Dennis Gansel's intensely beautiful film brings us inside Hitler's network of elite schools to groom young Germans for positions of power.
0.6 <|###|> A convincing German morality play about the Nazi's amoral worship of strength and power.
0.5 <|###|> A polished, German-tinged Dead Poets Society with budding SS automatons subbing in for privileged Vermont WASPs.
0.6 <|###|> Gansel crafts story and characters to show us a rare but possible youth of Nazi Germany whose inborn morality is not subject to "training.
0.4 <|###|> It was either this or watch paint dry
0.875 <|###|> The football scenes are brutally real; the locker room scenes are totally authentic.
0.875 <|###|> Pro football fans may be disillusioned by this excellent, honest, and often brutal expose of the play-for-pay game.
0.6 <|###|> The leading man, Nick Nolte, has a physical authority and a clowning, irreverent manner that lend the film some semblance of continuity, even when it's about to flounder.
0.6 <|###|> Raucous football tale with effective Nolte.
0.67 <|###|> It's still fascinating to get a glimpse of what athletes sacrifice to entertain us. It would have been considerably more fascinating if more of the people involved had seemed more human.
0.6 <|###|> For a sports flick, this is unique and holds your attention for the most part.
0.8 <|###|> Rough and grim knuckle-fighting drama headlining Charles Bronson.
0.8 <|###|> Walter Hill's first film as a director is spare, elegiac and as tough as a nickel steak.
0.625 <|###|> Too bad it is difficult to really care about what is going on since such a thoroughly unpleasant character is at the center.
0.5 <|###|> A slightly unpleasant and shocking film.
1.0 <|###|> Woody Allen nao e so um cineasta de extrema cultura e de um timing comico irrepreensivel. Ele e, antes de tudo, um dos mais talentosos roteiristas que o Cinema ja produziu.
0.8 <|###|> La historia es maravillosa.
0.5 <|###|> Witnessing Elisabeth Shue kissing Woody Allen full on the mouth in excruciating close-up is about as hard to watch as the wood-chipping scene in Fargo.
0.5 <|###|> The dialogue lacks snap, and Allen-the-actor's comic timing seems a beat off.
0.625 <|###|> The lightweight story eventually runs out of gas and stops, but it provides little to take away other than some fleeting humor.
0.5 <|###|> ...suffers from an egregiously laid-back pace that ultimately negates its few positive attributes...
0.5 <|###|> In the end, the script lets the film down with its obvious twists, its naggingly illogical narrative and a general pointlessness.
0.4 <|###|> A final reel of arterial spray splatter empties itself in record time and when Gone finally gets going, it's gone too soon.
0.5 <|###|> You will be kept waiting for the twist that never comes in Ringan Ledwidge's derivative psycho-thriller, whose by-the-numbers plotting is as inevitable as roadkill.
0.6 <|###|> If only it had taken the characters' lead and strayed further from the beaten track...
0.6 <|###|> A potentially menacing first half is let down by a few cliches in the home stretch.
0.375 <|###|> "Million Dollar Arm" is bland and overlong at 124 minutes. Simply put, there is nothing here of interest.
0.7 <|###|> Based on a true story, this is one of those relentlessly uplifting Disney movies that mixes comedy and emotion to inspire and move the audience.
0.4 <|###|> Craig Gillespie's by-numbers schmaltzathon never transcends its tourist's-eye views of India or patronisingly cliched views of its people.
0.6 <|###|> In its own gently comical way, Million Dollar Arm plays up the misunderstandings between Hollywood and India -- as well as the mutual fascination.
0.6 <|###|> A likeable and agreeable movie.
0.8 <|###|> Though it doesn't offer much by way of freshness, Million Dollar Arm is about as enjoyable as a predictable film gets, thanks to a feel good mix of genuine heart and wit.
0.8 <|###|> It might sound like a superhero movie but Million Dollar Arm is a stirringly human drama based on a true story and a welcome reminder that extraordinary feats can be achieved by mere mortals.
0.4 <|###|> A cold, hard business story, reshaped by Disney into a warm, fuzzy hug.
0.6 <|###|> There's nothing wildly unpredictable on offer here, but it still winningly manages to sneak its way past your defences.
0.8 <|###|> The steady hand of director Craig Gillespie (whose previous work includes the off-kilter Lars and the Real Girl) is evident throughout, and the result is warm, witty and thoroughly entertaining.
0.4 <|###|> Hamm's charm works well playing a debonair scoundrel on television but in this bland, family friendly offering, it's a resource that's quickly drained.
0.8 <|###|> Very funny underdog comedy that's genuinely heartwarming and full of charm.
0.6 <|###|> A cross between Bend It Like Beckham and Cool Runnings, you can see what Disney is pitching from a mile away, but it's polished and pleasant.
0.4 <|###|> Hamm and Bell keep this hooey light, but you can't lob a ball in here without hitting notes played better in Jerry Maguire and Slumdog Millionaire.
0.6 <|###|> As far as sports movies go, like Hamm, it's immensely likeable.
1.05 <|###|> "Million Dollar Arm" benefits from a strong performance by Jon Hamm in the lead and a top-notch supporting cast.
0.5 <|###|> Its true story actually smells rather fishy in that almost everything about it plays as manufactured schmaltz.
0.375 <|###|> ...it ultimately seems obvious that this material is inherently not able to sustain a feature-length endeavor.
0.8 <|###|> A Grand Slam
0.75 <|###|> Achieves a certain emotional authenticity even as the viewer anticipates exactly which heart string will be plucked and how.
0.75 <|###|> Million Dollar Arm scores a triple.
0.5 <|###|> Million Dollar Arm could be subtitled The Best Exotic Marigold Pitching Mound.
0.75 <|###|> It doesn't have a mean bone in its overly long body of a script. The touch of Disney, a family-friendly PG rating and a baseball story add up to a crowd-pleaser in 'Million Dollar Arm.'
0.5 <|###|> Sappy, saccharine, and predictable to the point where it's almost painful.
0.9 <|###|> An uplifting and inspirational tale
0.5 <|###|> Million Dollar Arm, you had me at Jerry Maguire.
0.6 <|###|> It may not be the most memorable film out there, but Million Dollar Arm is a fine film that the whole family can enjoy.
0.5 <|###|> All the potential edges have been sanded off. And so, a quite remarkable true story, no matter how truthfully told, feels like a formulaic fable.
0.6 <|###|> For a heart-warming movie that praises risk taking and out of the box thinking, Million Dollar Arm plays its narrative surprisingly safe.
0.6 <|###|> Luckily, a terrific cast that includes Alan Arkin, Suraj Sharma, Bill Paxton, Pitobash Tripathy and Madhur Mittal holds this unwieldy thing together. (Bill Paxton, Jon Hamm or Lake Bell in the cast of any film is generally a good sign.)
0.7 <|###|> Based on true events, this is a heartwarming, uplifting, feel-good family film - in the popular Disney underdog sports genre.
0.64 <|###|> A charming cast makes it succeed, but a lack of willingness to really push boundaries never lets it become anything more.
0.5 <|###|> The best thing that can be said about Million Dollar Arm is that it wears its emotions honestly. But as a fan of baseball, I have to say that matchups are always more interesting when you go into that first inning unaware of who's going to win the game.
0.6 <|###|> Feel-good sports dramedy is a fine pick for tweens.
0.875 <|###|> JB is not the wisest of men and Million Dollar Arm makes no bones about him being a character in need of an upward arc. Even so, the movie never sacrifices the other characters as mere handmaidens to his growth.
0.6 <|###|> Million Dollar Arm is like taking a tour bus ride with a competent guide: You know exactly where it's going, but you like the company.
1.0 <|###|> Outstanding drama about morals and our choices.
1.0 <|###|> Both dramatically and historically important with fine turns by Fiennes and Turturro, directed by Redford.
1.0 <|###|> Acutely observed, beautifully performed, lovingly directed media morality tale that resonates far beyond its 1950s setting.
0.875 <|###|> It's a blessedly old-fashioned, well-made and well-acted narrative...
0.7 <|###|> ...Redford manages to build quite a snowball of drama in all of this, full of heroes and antiheroes...
1.0 <|###|> Gripping, compelling, absorbing ... yeah, all those adjectives and more, This is a great movie.
0.75 <|###|> A marvelous performance by Ralph Fiennes.
1.0 <|###|> One of the greatest American films. Compelling scandal and heartbreaking victims.
0.4 <|###|> Boring movie about the most dull scandal in the history of television.
0.8 <|###|> Mr. Redford has made a rich, handsome, articulate film about a subject truly worth talking about.
0.625 <|###|> As a pure period piece Quiz Show delivers beautifully, but Redford's foursquare, documentary-like approach, however artful, unspools a story with about as much drama as a game show itself.
0.8 <|###|> A quietly powerful take on innocence lost, its lessons apparent every time we turn on the television.
0.8 <|###|> Quiz Show' is a uniquely American tragedy, told with subtlety and complexity.
1.0 <|###|> Robert Redford's assurded true story about quiz show corruption is totally engrossing, with genius performances from Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro.
0.6 <|###|> Redford again showed his good directorial skills and the recreation of late 1950s is almost flawless.
0.625 <|###|> I have to give the film a mild thumbs up as it is an interesting story and the performance by Fiennes is worth seeing.
0.8 <|###|> Aside from the impeccable structure of Paul Attanasio's screenplay, Quiz Show also works on several dichotomous levels.
0.875 <|###|> The screenplay, by former Washington Post film critic Paul Attanasio, is smart, subtle and ruthless.
1.0 <|###|> Manages a trick that few films even dare try -- to take a hard look at personal and public moral issues and still provide dazzling entertainment.
0.75 <|###|> With the possible exception of The Shawshank Redemption, Quiz Show has the best script of any film I have seen this year.
1.0 <|###|> Every characterization is full and rounded; every scene is a perfect development of theme. The dialogue is filled with crisp, subtle and quotable lines.
0.875 <|###|> Crisply directed by Redford from a thought-provoking script by Paul Attanasio, and featuring a slew of strong performances.
0.87 <|###|> ...an assured first feature that seems to announce the arrival of impressive cinematic sensibility.
0.45 <|###|> If the finale was able to match the suspenseful buildup, the scale might have tipped to make The Sleepwalker a remarkable accomplishment, rather than a letdown.
0.25 <|###|> Among the many unanswered questions, I ask: Where do they find this junk, and where do so many amateurs get the money to finance it?
0.625 <|###|> The film soon settles into a confident, well-staged groove, primarily because of two unambiguously terrific performances.
0.4 <|###|> Slackers meet Satan in not-quite-so-excellent adventure.
0.5 <|###|> Mostly disappointing results.
1.0 <|###|> Has there ever been a more perfect role for Keanu Reeves than floppy-haired, dim-brained high school slacker Ted "Theodore" Logan?
0.5 <|###|> ...the various elements that made Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure such an unexpected delight are almost entirely absent here.
0.8 <|###|> awash in weird humor and outlandish gags
0.75 <|###|> A riot of visual invention and weird humor that works on its chosen sub-moronic level, and on several others as well...
0.6 <|###|> strained but goofy fun
0.6 <|###|> Its best moments make up for its more mediocre ones.
0.8 <|###|> More mindless airhead time-traveling fun. The hilarious William Sadler gives the best portrayal of Death since Bengt Ekerot in THE SEVENTH SEAL.
0.8 <|###|> EXCELLENT! (But not quite as EXCELLENT! as the first.)
0.6 <|###|> Worth seeing if only for the scene in which Bill & Ted play 'Battleship' with Death.
0.6 <|###|> Diverting nonsense
0.7 <|###|> Doesn't eclipse the original, but the dorky charm is still there ... plus it's got William Sadler's immortal turn as Death.
0.8 <|###|> One of the most worthwhile sequels of recent years, maybe funnier than the original as it intelligently expands the potential for the surreal and it ties up all the loose ends managing, quite remarkably, to give pointlessness a purpose.
0.625 <|###|> Silly, sophomoric and very weird. Or, in Bill and Ted's vocabulary, it's lame, scorched and egregious.
0.5 <|###|> So ridiculously dumb that it's difficult to be a good sport about it.
0.5 <|###|> Fans won't be disappointed and people who didn't like the previous film wouldn't like this one either.
0.8 <|###|> Screwball comedy for older teens and adults.
0.8 <|###|> This is the Coens dabbling in the mainstream, and bending it to their will.
1.0 <|###|> The Coensa(TM) first mainstream romantic comedy is a superb hijacking of an ailing art form -- short, sharp and frequently laugh-out-loud hilarious.
0.5 <|###|> Destined to rank among the Coens' least memorable achievements.
0.8 <|###|> A great movie.
0.6 <|###|> A fun romp, thanks largely to the deft work of its two leads.
0.6 <|###|> Despite the inconsistent script and low tone, this has many funny moments. If you can forget the negative view it takes of mankind, ita(TM)s entertaining because of the performances of Clooney, Zeta Jones, and the rest of the cast.
0.875 <|###|> The Coens ... have taken a typically trite target for ridicule and splayed it out for an attack from outer space, where Coen brothers scripts tend to originate.
0.75 <|###|> Half the pleasure of Intolerable Cruelty is watching the Coens play it safe
0.8 <|###|> A date-movie with brain cells.
0.6 <|###|> Viewers won't feel like they've been dealt with too cruelly.
0.375 <|###|> The operative word in this film is 'restrained.'
0.4 <|###|> It has some good gags, but then so did The Wedding Singer.
0.5 <|###|> ...it does live up to its title by being both cruel and intolerable, although not necessarily in the redeeming ways one might hope for.
0.75 <|###|> Clooney, in one of his best screen turns to date, exhibits the right degree of screwball aptitude.
0.4 <|###|> Unlike Steve Martin's portraits of LA, "Intolerable Cruelty" doesn't find the loneliness beneath the sheen.
0.875 <|###|> Darkly funny and oh-so-wicked, "Intolerable Cruelty" is quirky diversion that will appeal to fans of other Coen brothers films.
0.8 <|###|> Watching Clooney and Zeta-Jones interact is suitably fun, and neither of them is exactly hard on the eyes.
0.5 <|###|> A pretty much paint by numbers job, but Clooney and the divine Ms. Jones have great chemistry and timing and successfully manage to wrestle the script to the ground.
0.75 <|###|> A frequently hilarious screwball comedy about the battle between the sexes, which here all boils down to one thing: money.
0.75 <|###|> While it's not nearly as beguiling as the Coen's last pic, the uncanny The Man Who Wasn't There, Cruelty is still a brisk hoot.
0.75 <|###|> It will delight their fans with its random humor and its palate of bizarre characters.
0.5 <|###|> ...the movie eventually takes a dark turn that it's never quite able to recover from.
0.75 <|###|> Both Clooney and Zeta-Jones are given simple lines that they deliver so deliciously that they set some sort of gold standard.
0.875 <|###|> The joy of Intolerable Cruelty is in watching Clooney deconstruct his suave screen persona, that mix of Cary Grant cool and Dean Martin hip, in front of your very eyes.
0.6 <|###|> Worth seeing, and more fun than the average Hollywood rom-com.
0.75 <|###|> Clooney and Zeta-Jones have a level of antagonistic banter recalling the best of the Hepburn-Tracy chemistry. Now, this is what is meant by the term movie star.
0.375 <|###|> ...a decidedly underwhelming entry within Kubrick's increasingly spotty body of work...
1.0 <|###|> By a whopping margin, this is Kubrick's most radical film and greatest dramatic gamble.
1.0 <|###|> The blackest black comedy ever made by a major Hollywood studio, and one of the funniest handful of films made in English.
1.0 <|###|> Because of its uncanny insight and frighteningly prescient satirical edge, Dr. Strangelove is a document of its time and also timeless. It held onto its relevancy by being bitter, cynical, and thinking absolutely the worst of people.
1.0 <|###|> Dr Strangelove is one of Stanley Kubrick's many masterpieces, one of the greatest films about the Cold War and one of the greatest comedies ever made.
1.0 <|###|> Black comedy Kubrick classic for smart teens+.
0.9 <|###|> It's easily one of the director's best films of his somewhat controversial career.
0.875 <|###|> Dr. Strangelove's status as the movie that confirmed both Stanley Kubrick's reputation and the arrival of beat-sick irreverence can no longer be retracted.
0.8 <|###|> Kubrick nos presenteia com uma perola de humor negro que critica acidamente as guerras e a mediocridade dos homens por tras destas.
0.8 <|###|> It's as startling today as it was then. Catch it now before it becomes too relevant to be funny again.
1.0 <|###|> Sound funny? It is.
1.0 <|###|> Endures as one of the finest political satires.
1.0 <|###|> It still features Peter Sellers' finest three performances as well as proving that the supposedly humourless Kubrick was up for a laugh.
1.0 <|###|> This landmark movie's madcap humor and terrifying suspense remain undiminished by time.
1.0 <|###|> Stanley Kubrick's 40-year-old satirical polital-comedy about the end of the world is especially disturbing as one ponders world events at present.
1.0 <|###|> The paradigm of all end-of-the-world political thrillers and a part of the American vernacular.
1.0 <|###|> Is Dr. Strangelove Kubrick's best movie? Along with Paths of Glory, absolutely.
1.0 <|###|> Kubrick's great 1964 tragicomedy about superpowers on the nuclear brink continues to fascinate new generations of moviegoers, as its frequent reissues attest.
1.0 <|###|> A masterpiece of satire, paranoia and straight comedy. One of the all-time classics with a great cast and many memorable moments. Sellers is magnificent.
1.0 <|###|> If there never were another satire of war, you'd think this one would have single-handedly stopped the whole mad business.
1.0 <|###|> Frightening, hilarious -- and indelible.
1.0 <|###|> Masterful and highly original
0.75 <|###|> ...still shocking in its giggly nihilism.
1.0 <|###|> Masterpiece
1.0 <|###|> Easily classifiable as one of the top ten films of all time.
1.0 <|###|> Hysterically funny cold war satire. Peter Sellers' triple role is the crowning touch. One of Kubrick's greatest films.
1.0 <|###|> The shameful, criminal wrongs depicted in this document from the past are with us today.
1.0 <|###|> An absolutely hilarious and brilliant satire in which Kubrick's assured and precise direction serves, for once, to make an incredibly entertaing film as well as a smart one.
1.0 <|###|> The final word on the Cold War... the defining text on a subject so overwhelmingly horrible that all you can do is laugh.
1.0 <|###|> Stanley Kubrick's best film. A perfect satire.
0.9 <|###|> One of the greatest films ever made.
1.0 <|###|> A Duck Soup for the Cold War era.
1.0 <|###|> The film is always saying something, and a viewer would have to be deaf and blind not to recognize the targets of the sarcasm.
1.0 <|###|> Dr. Strangelove (1964) is filled with great comic performances.
0.5 <|###|> Like so many movies, the set-up and presentation of Gamer is awesome. The story, characters and writing... not so much.
0.2 <|###|> Wait for this one on Cable... jeez I'm saying that a lot. What is really going on in 2009?
0.25 <|###|> What to make of short-attention-span artists satirizing a short-attention-span world? [Blu-ray]
0.25 <|###|> Incoherent and interminable...
0.2 <|###|> a big, loud mess that loses its few good ideas in a morass of convoluted storytelling that it has, sadly, confused with stylish innovation
0.625 <|###|> Like the 'Crank' films, this is an absurdly exaggerated, outlandishly crass and alternately inventive and appalling depiction of a man violently fighting to liberate himself from the forces that seek to control him...
0.6 <|###|> An injection of adrenaline straight to the eye - which isn't entirely a bad thing.
0.5 <|###|> If you are a gamer, and like shooters, science fiction, action, and wouldn't consider gratuitous boob shots gratuitous, you won't feel short-changing on leaving the cinema after watching Gamer.
0.0 <|###|> Can I get back the ninety minutes of my life that I squandered sitting through this miasmic upchuck of techno sludge? What was the story again?
0.6 <|###|> With its nano-technology synching different brains together, spyware programs attached to DNA, and a double dose of bad taste served up with a side-dish of splattered brains and skull fragments, Gamer is still mad, bad, and dangerous to know.
0.6 <|###|> It won't win points for originality or depth, but the Crank boys are still on their game as far as sex, violence and sheer unapologetic excess go. High concept, high octane, highly likely to end up a post-pub staple.
0.4 <|###|> While packed with guns, girls and gore, there's none of the gleeful knowingness that made their earlier films such guilty pleasures.
0.4 <|###|> Edited with the finesse of a toddler on a sherbet dib-dab rush, the film dashes from one over-stylised battle sequence to the next.
0.4 <|###|> The action sequences are disappointing, there's a distinct lack of wit or invention in the direction and it's also impossible to care about the characters when they're so thinly sketched.
0.3 <|###|> The film is a cacophonous mess without a single interesting character.
0.4 <|###|> The best that can be said about Gamer is "straight to DVD". It's a mind-numbing dud of a movie that in reality is nothing more than a big budget computer game splashed across the silver screen with an all star cast.
0.6 <|###|> Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor deserve some credit for being upfront about their desire to deliver purely adrenaline-driven action cinema and for making it look brilliant.
0.75 <|###|> Were Stanley Kubrick and Russ Meyer alive and their minds merged "Being John Malkovich"-style, the clash of their ids and egos might yield "Gamer." It will make you feel putrid, but it's satire that's sadistic, salacious and audaciously entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> attempts to lure audiences in with its fast-action but also provides a surprisingly thoughtful commentary on control and freedom and the means some will go to achieve it.
0.8 <|###|> Puts the viscera in visceral but a thought-provoking exploration of our increasingly disconnected society in drag as mindless action.
0.125 <|###|> Takes itself far too seriously, saying nothing of timeliness or value in a banally overblown fashion.
0.25 <|###|> Poor editing makes Gamer overlong, and the negative portrayal of gamers is as hard to swallow as the cheesy plot.
0.2 <|###|> It is, in the end, a migraine in search of a movie-goer, one that hypocritically berates pop-culture's bloodthirst even as it eagerly quenches it with a sadistic barrage of severed limbs and crushed skulls.
0.8 <|###|> Perhaps the most deliriously demented film of the year. I say that with honest admiration for the deliriously demented.
0.4 <|###|> A lot of good actors waste their time and talent in a very disappointing movie
0.2 <|###|> In the press materials Mr. Butler informs us enthusiastically that the movie "has all the hallmarks of Neveldine's and Taylor's sick, yet genius minds." At least he's half right.
0.375 <|###|> Bodies and buildings blow up but this is carnage of the most lacklustre sort, with any momentum petering out long before it's "game over."
0.3 <|###|> It's a deeply cynical and joyless point of view, completely lacking in the winking visual style that made Crank worth a look.
0.375 <|###|> Add an element of interactivity into the hyperkinetic, repetitive action, plodding narrative, and stupefyingly obvious social commentary, and the potential might exist for something entertaining.
0.375 <|###|> The game sequences are all familiar flash, and zero tension.
0.75 <|###|> A cautionary tale issuing a dire warning about the prospects for humanity in a world where machines lead and people follow.
0.625 <|###|> I happily anticipated seeing what the writer/director team of the two 'Crank' movies would come up with next.
0.35 <|###|> A mindless and tedious sci-fi action film that's high on style while low on substance and palpable thrills.
0.5 <|###|> It's a mess of a film mainly because the "CRANK"-style of filmmaking doesn't really fit with the material because for the most part, the movie is played straight. It's a real shame cause the premise sounded ridiculously fun
0.4 <|###|> Gamer scratches at the shameless energy of the Crank films occasionally, but it mostly goes, as if on rails, to the inevitable conclusion.
0.4 <|###|> A dull slog of endless action and sex, trying so hard to push the pleasure centers on the brains of its adolescent male audience that it wears itself, and the audience, out
0.5 <|###|> The action scenes are a giant blurry glob of explosions, sudden attacks and spontaneous graphic deaths.
0.625 <|###|> Even if you haven't seen any of the tell-all television spots, every beat of this crime drama will look and sound familiar.
0.6 <|###|> The leads make it watchable (plus it's always a hoot to see Denise Richards onscreen in any form)...
0.5 <|###|> None of this finds an emotional connection, and instead we watch it predictably unfold.
0.5 <|###|> The film's hodgepodge plot stumbles down the prototypical path of a gangster's fall from grace with a bit of Boiler Room thrown in for good measure.
0.6 <|###|> Depois de capturar a imaginacao do espectador com um inicio envolvente e promissor, a historia se perde de forma irremediavel, desperdicando o imenso potencial de seus dois primeiros atos.
0.6 <|###|> Moody, stylish tale of heroin dealer John Leguizamo facing the white-collar world is a well-shot debut from Franc Reyes.
0.6 <|###|> Yes, we're walking those mean streets again. Good thing we're taking a few unanticipated turns.
0.5 <|###|> Unfortunately, Empire is nothing more than an exhausting retread of the same cliched urban cautionary tale that waxes about rebellion and redemption.
0.375 <|###|> The film ends up being derivative of every drug-themed, drug-centered movie we've ever seen, and goes down the same dark unforgiving and predictable path as all the others did.
0.4 <|###|> There isn't a redeeming character to be found in Empire which makes it awfully hard to enjoy.
0.2 <|###|> Try as I may, I can't think of a single good reason to see this movie, even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted, 'Thank you!' when Leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie.
0.5 <|###|> A yawningly familiar melodrama about an enterprising hustler who's undone by his own ambitions.
0.4 <|###|> A dreary rip-off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for Hispanic Americans.
0.6 <|###|> An entertaining, colorful, action-filled crime story with an intimate heart.
0.375 <|###|> John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie.
0.2 <|###|> The film is shoddy and amateurish; the blood in the gunfight scenes even looks like ketchup.
0.375 <|###|> Feels like it was made by some old Bolsheviks, who, in a vodka stupor, thought they were remaking THE GODFATHER.
0.25 <|###|> If you've spent every waking moment since the summer of 1991 pining for a 'New Jack City' with a salsa soundtrack, your cinematic savior has arrived.
0.5 <|###|> Filmmaker Franc Reyes would have been better off skipping the elaborate scam plot and focusing on the conflicts that arise when a dealer trades in his gold chain for an Armani suit.
0.5 <|###|> Like its protagonist, the movie tries to rise above convention, flails about a bit, and slides back into self-parody.
0.5 <|###|> Empire has its visual and character attributes, but the culmination of its 90 minutes is akin to reaching out for something substantial, and coming away with nothing but thin air.
0.64 <|###|> It's sort of a 21st century morality play with a Latino hip hop beat. But the second half of the movie really goes downhill.
0.6 <|###|> Not much going on with this one. It was part Scarface, part New Jack City and part Sugarhill. If you've- seen these, you've seen Empire.
0.45 <|###|> Guns, blah, blah, blah, drugs, blah, blah, blah, guns, drugs, and money, blah, blah, blah.
0.4 <|###|> This tale has been told and retold; the races and rackets change, but the song remains the same.
0.5 <|###|> Delivers the same old same old, tarted up with Latin flava and turned out by Hollywood playas.
0.4 <|###|> Not atrocious, but certainly far from being as good as it might have been.
0.75 <|###|> A gangster movie with the capacity to surprise.
0.625 <|###|> Victor Rosa is Leguizamo's best movie work so far, a subtle and richly internalized performance.
0.5 <|###|> A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales.
0.5 <|###|> Another excuse to trot out the usual ghetto-melodramatic bromides: What Happens When You Leave the Old Neighborhood Behind and Remembering Who Your Real Posse Is and, most of all, Respecting the Woman Who Loves You Best.
0.5 <|###|> If Arenas is making some kind of statement with its initial release, it seems to be declaring, 'We can make a dumb Goodfellas knockoff just as well as any other ethnic group.'
0.5 <|###|> Empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film. It doesn't work as either.
0.4 <|###|> Manages to make even watching naked strippers in a hot tub a laborious experience.
0.9 <|###|> This marriage of indelible imagery with electric, seemingly incongruous pop songs wouldn't be bettered until, well, the next time Scorsese decided to do it.
0.875 <|###|> Features an attention-grabbing performance by Robert De Niro, but I maintain that Harvey Keitel's excellent central performance has always been critically undervalued.
0.8 <|###|> Authentic in feel and immensely personal in subject matter, Mean Streets marked the arrival of one Martin Scorsese and his unique brand of urban filmmaking.
0.875 <|###|> showcases Scorsese's artistic strengths and weaknesses as they stood at the outset of his career
1.0 <|###|> The movie's blazing energy is still astounding; the verite street-scenes are terrific and Scorsese's pioneering use of popular music is genuinely thrilling.
0.8 <|###|> A tight, intense masterpiece from Scorsese, writing collaborator Mardik Martin and the iconic stars.
0.88 <|###|> The film feels authentic, the characters are true, the situation hopeless
0.4 <|###|> Doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid.
1.0 <|###|> Terrific. Top shelf talent at the top of their game, working immediately before they would change Hollywood.
1.0 <|###|> Scorsese's first masterpiece is still gripping.
0.8 <|###|> One of cinema's finest moments....you'll never forget it
0.875 <|###|> Perfected here are Scorsese's patented slow-motion cutaways, combination pan/tracking shots, ingenious use of pop music, and impromptu bloodbaths
1.0 <|###|> The Godfather made the mob glamorous. Mean Streets made it real. Martin Scorsese's ferocious, grimy 1973 classic is just as good as Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, but it shows us criminal life lower down the food chain.
0.8 <|###|> ...a gritty, one-of-a-kind, unromantic, down-and-dirty look at the streets of New York like no film had portrayed those streets and their people before.
1.0 <|###|> Without exaggeration, you could make an argument for Mean Streets being the most influential film of the last fifty years.
0.9 <|###|> The hilarious scene in which Charlie and Johnny Boy argue about Johnny Boy's debts in the backroom of a bar (a scene that was improvised) is alone worth the price of admission.
1.0 <|###|> No matter how bleak the milieu, no matter how heartbreaking the narrative, some films are so thoroughly, beautifully realized they have a kind of tonic effect that has no relation to the subject matter.
1.0 <|###|> One of Scorsese's true classics.
1.0 <|###|> A true rough diamond, Scorsese's breakthrough may be uneven, but at its heart lies fledgling genius.
1.0 <|###|> Its greatness lies in its leanness, with nary a word, a move, a gesture that's nonessential.
1.0 <|###|> A ferociously original film.
0.8 <|###|> One of those movies that you should see, even if it is only to watch a masterful director's first superior film.
1.0 <|###|> Everyone involved brings a near-dizzying rhythm to this quintessential 'New York movie' and its collection of outsider-characters, all intoxicated on themselves.
1.0 <|###|> In countless ways, right down to the detail of modern TV crime shows, Mean Streets is one of the source points of modern movies.
0.4 <|###|> A competent but self-righteous film that offers little insight into love or faith.
0.5 <|###|> If religious films aren't your bailiwick, stay away. Otherwise, this could be a passable date film.
0.5 <|###|> The film is old-fashioned, occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface.
0.625 <|###|> Beers, who, when she's given the right lines, can charm the paint off the wall ... [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures.
0.5 <|###|> Imagine the CleanFlicks version of 'Love Story,' with Ali MacGraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes.
0.5 <|###|> The romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be.
0.8 <|###|> Extraordinary footage is the highlight of Saving Luna. It is truly mind-boggling to see and hear the Orca, an endearing creature whose playfulness is unexpected and surprisingly moving.
0.875 <|###|> The real-life story of Luna -- the orphaned male orca that found itself abandoned in 2001 in B.C.'s Nootka Sound and opted for human company over finding its pod -- begs big-budget Hollywood treatment.
0.8 <|###|> Whether you loved or hated the idea of an orca seeking human company, the story resonated across generational lines and tugged at something deeper, perhaps even primal, in the human psyche. Because directors Parfit and Chisholm explore this psycho-spiritu
0.5 <|###|> The film about an animal that doesn't respect boundaries has set none for itself.
0.2 <|###|> A shockingly crass grab for holiday pocket money that's both infantile and endlessly patronising.
0.4 <|###|> A re-hash of tired cliches and CGI effects.
0.5 <|###|> That the lead character is a 'male cow' complete with udders shows how confused the picture is.
0.6 <|###|> A beatifully animated simple but fun plot, carries enough giggles for all age groups.
0.4 <|###|> The animation is perfectly colorful and the voice actors earn their paychecks, but it's blatantly obvious that this thing started production without a screenplay -- and hit the screens without a plot.
0.4 <|###|> Deserves to be hanging in the nearest meat locker.
0.2 <|###|> This could be the film that snaps everyone's patience with Hollywood animations which have a Dell computer chip where their heart should be.
0.4 <|###|> There are far better ways of keeping the kids happy.
0.6 <|###|> Good voice talent and some funny moments.
0.4 <|###|> It's impossible to shake the impression that Barnyard was written by idiots. Why else would the male cows have udders?
0.3 <|###|> The design is uninteresting, the characters are bland and the story is terrible.
0.3 <|###|> Strictly for kids, and, as the three or four people who saw Oedekerk's previous directing effort, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist, can attest, the writer/director tends to stretch even throwaway jokes minutes past the punch line.
0.6 <|###|> Ben the Cow (the voice of Sam Elliott) has to teach his carefree son Otis (Kevin James) the responsibility of leadership over the farm animals. This is far from Otis' mind, but inevitable. Barnyard is a farm version of The Lion King with eno
0.625 <|###|> There is a nice mix of humour and pathos here. Barnyard may not be all that exceptional, but it is quite satisfying.
0.125 <|###|> Not good enough for even a rental, this 'Barnyard' should be burned for fear of mad cow disease
0.5 <|###|> Barnyard doesn't know if it wants to be another tiresomely 'hip' piece of post-Shrek postmodernism or a comfortably traditional kids' movie that delivers family values without the self-conscious smirk.
0.5 <|###|> Could cause more gender confusion than 'Transamerica.'
0.625 <|###|> All the cows have udders - even the male ones. In real life, only female cows have udders. What kind of sick, alternate cow universe does this movie take place in anyway?
0.375 <|###|> Barnyard is a one-note premise that falls flat after about 10 minutes.
0.5 <|###|> "Barnyard" doesn't stink. But it's not the cream of the crop, either.
0.5 <|###|> The funniest joke is the one nobody talks about: the gender confusion of male cows with udders.
0.4 <|###|> Barnyard isn't a complete waste of time, it's just too familiar.
0.375 <|###|> A Lion King clone that's tailored to the Fisher-Price crowd.
0.25 <|###|> With shamefully obvious nods to the father/son sentimentality of traditional Disney 'toons and even an awkward love interest, Barnyard is a mishmash of modern cartoon cliches.
0.4 <|###|> With 'Barnyard,' the androgynous udders, as annoying as they can be, are about the only original thing to be found in the whole movie.
0.5 <|###|> never really amazing enough to separate it from the rest of the herd of great animation that we've seen this summer.
0.375 <|###|> [W]hy do the male cows have udders?.. This isn't supposed to be the animated version of TransAmerica.
0.2 <|###|> doesn't just violate the audience's right to entertainment, it violates animal dignity to such an extent that PETA might want to consider getting involved
0.375 <|###|> The CG animation looks like rubbery plastic instead of animals, and much of it is spent on jokes related to derrieres and hindquarters.
0.422 <|###|> Lesbian Cows!!! Lesbian COWS!!!! Carnivorous LESBIAN COWS!!!! Aarg!
0.375 <|###|> There's barely enough of a story to sustain a short film, much less a feature.
0.2 <|###|> Forget the confusion of the he-cows that populate the film; the real problem is that Barnyard is just a lousy, lousy movie.
0.4 <|###|> Udderly ordinary.
0.375 <|###|> Nearly every joke lays an egg.
0.5 <|###|> your kid won't learn anything from Barnyard, but they might need 10 years of therapy after viewing the movie's fight scenes and COYOTES ATTACKING THE FARM.
0.4 <|###|> Laughter comes from the movie's absurdity, not its comedy.
0.0 <|###|> Other than confusing children, it's hard to know what the inane, tedious, mean-spirited Barnyard is trying to do.
0.8 <|###|> Director Jennifer Jessum, who also co-produced and co-shot the film with Simon Joseph, adeptly contextualizes White's story within the painful and complex Lakota and Pine Ridge history.
0.3 <|###|> Another weak, uninspired effort that once again proves that if you want fun, exciting adventures featuring The Avengers your local theater is the only option worth considering.
0.625 <|###|> Two delightful stars nudge Wild Target into sleeper territory - but only by a few inches.
0.6 <|###|> ...mindless entertainment in a refined style.
0.5 <|###|> Wild Target is the sort of madcap comedy that breaks a sweat trying to generate a steady stream of laughs, but ... the film only works in fits and starts.
0.75 <|###|> "Wild Target" has fast, quippy dialogue and exactly the right actors to drive it home.
0.4 <|###|> When the various elements all fizzle, all we're left with is some likable actors trying their best to save a fading film.
0.7 <|###|> Snappy, sarcastic, implausible caper that looses almost all momentum 1 hour in. Also, how do you feel about Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt making out? If you just threw up in your mouth a little, you might wanna avoid this.
0.7 <|###|> Saucy, scattershot, screwball farce.
0.625 <|###|> The film has to fly by its wits -- and its witty lines -- and by the charm of its stars. This it does, just barely.
0.375 <|###|> It's never a good idea to cast Bill Nighy as a buttoned-down hit man.
0.4 <|###|> Screenwriter Lucinda Coxon has clearly never met a corny complication she didn't like, and Wild Target becomes riddled with irksomely madcap happenings by the final act.
0.3 <|###|> Rarely in a British comedy have so many richly talented actors laboured so long in search of a coherent plot, plausible characters and even a modicum of humour.
0.7 <|###|> If not better than the French original, this re-make is equally good and equally funny.
0.4 <|###|> The film is directed with a surprising lack of comic spark by Jonathan Lynn.
0.4 <|###|> With an interesting premise and a capable cast, it's a shame the result is such a dead horse.
0.5 <|###|> A mostly admirable attempt at a Crichton-like escapade that runs out of steam a bit before half-way.
0.6 <|###|> Wild Target gets its gears gunked up by a detour into the shallow, polluted waters of pseudo-psychological melodrama.
0.75 <|###|> There have been a lot of black comedies about assassins lately -- there have been a few just this year -- but Wild Target may be the first one to contain genuine laughs.
0.625 <|###|> An eccentric little comic thriller filled with enough laughs that I was mostly willing to overlook the fact that it makes virtually no sense as a thriller.
0.4 <|###|> All of this busyness drains away the film's charm, turning what might have been a naughty and whimsical frolic into something glib, hectic and sour.
0.5 <|###|> Since irony is so often director Jonathan Lynn's weapon of choice, Wild Target should have been a good fit. It's not quite.
0.2 <|###|> desperately unfunny
0.875 <|###|> The movie's a grand, quick-witted entertainment, a throwback in the best, most welcome sense.
0.3 <|###|> Director Jonathan Lynn already made one assassin comedy ... Consider this the lazy encore no one asked for.
0.375 <|###|> Wild Target neatly and boringly makes a surrogate family out of its ill-matched trio of caricatures, and its epilogue of domesticity is enough to make you reach for your revolver.
0.25 <|###|> Nothing works.
0.4 <|###|> It's entertainment designed to resemble a good time without aspiring to provide one.
0.625 <|###|> The likable and talented cast give it their all, but it's never as zany or funny as it should have been.
0.5 <|###|> Wild Target is a remake of a French farce, and it shows.
0.4 <|###|> Nighy and Blunt do bring a lot of warmth and charm to their roles, but thanks to a badly judged script and lazy direction, the final showdown leaves you feeling cold.
0.6 <|###|> When Wild Target works it's a lot of fun. There's some decent comic chemistry between the three leads - and this is Grint's first film since Harry Potter 3 that didn't make me want to lob him out the window.
0.5 <|###|> This lively British remake of the 1993 French film is an enjoyable if ultimately too-silly romp. But the solid cast at least makes it watchable, even when the plot takes a series of deeply contrived turns.
0.4 <|###|> There's a wretched tiredness and dull reliance on formula and, hard as the cast may try, a powerful whiff of desperation not helped by the ikky prospect of Bill and Emily getting jiggy.
0.4 <|###|> The action hits a dead end and the laughs dry up, but it's the budding romance between the young free spirit and the crotchety old triggerman that really kills it.
0.4 <|###|> an interesting mess
0.6 <|###|> There are moments of absolute magic.
0.75 <|###|> Nearly a masterpiece
0.875 <|###|> by every definition, a beautiful film: it's lovely to look at--and perhaps even moreso to listen to; and the acting is exquisite.
0.75 <|###|> A good-spirited fable ... it's the type of movie that either you'll love or you'll hate. Count me in the former category.
0.4 <|###|> [Ben Affleck's] Jack Ryan is simply impossible to take seriously, and that's something the film could probably never survive.
0.4 <|###|> Generic action film not good for kids, or anyone.
0.75 <|###|> Though this political adventure requires substantial suspension of disbelief, the witty script and mature approach keep the film on track. [Blu-Ray]
0.625 <|###|> ... Entertaining and far more relevant than most other action/adventure movies.
0.4 <|###|> Has enough cliches and cut-out characters to condemn it to mediocrity.
0.8 <|###|> Realizando um bom trabalho ao condensar o complexo livro de Clancy, o filme e tenso, inteligente e conta com fortes atuacoes de todo o elenco - inclusive de Affleck, que confere uma curiosa vulnerabilidade ao heroi.
0.8 <|###|> It's a tired premise, and it's got its flaws, but the present talent makes it worthwhile.
0.6 <|###|> Tom Clancy franchise gets a surprisingly satisfying reinvention thanks to star Ben Affleck and director Phil Alden Robinson.
0.625 <|###|> It's all fast and loud and pulse-pounding, of course, but nothing that we haven't seen dozens of times on screen after imaginary disasters.
0.875 <|###|> Superior genre storytelling, which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line.
0.75 <|###|> The Sum of All Fears proves that the Jack Ryan franchise still has some legs. Most importantly, it also has a brain.
0.3 <|###|> Clancy's world is strictly for the techno-nerds and frankly they're welcome to it.
0.6 <|###|> Deals with a chillingly topical nuclear attack on Baltimore. But perhaps more disturbingly, it rehashes it into a Ben Affleck action romance.
0.8 <|###|> All shame aside, not being a Tom Clancy fan or Jack Ryan fan, I did quite enjoy it. Is it Morgan Freeman?
0.5 <|###|> An implausible apocalypse without depth or resonance, a cartoon of international politics presented with no James Bond-like playfulness and with all the superficial realism money can buy.
0.75 <|###|> El filme provoca que la audiencia piense y medite sobre el mundo en que habitamos, asi como en los obsoletos sistemas de gobierno que hemos creado como sociedad.
0.75 <|###|> A competent Tom Clancy thriller that's betrayed by a miscast Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan.
0.625 <|###|> If nothing else, this film may stand as a cultural testament to how times really have changed since Sept. 11 -- and not necessarily the way we'd expect.
0.5 <|###|> (Not) the biggest or best film of this summer's blockbuster season, but it does hold up well under fire as long as you don't think about anything too hard.
0.6 <|###|> To sum it up: heavy on imagination and light on reality.
0.8 <|###|> A Alden Robinson, el director, le sento bien la amistad con Tom Hanks y Spielberg al haber dirigido recientemente para la TV, el drama de guerra Band of Brothers.
0.4 <|###|> Affleck's performance is so lightweight that he feels like a secondary character, barely involved with this struggle against a terrorist nuclear attack.
0.5 <|###|> The star who helped give a spark to "Chasing Amy" and "Changing Lanes" falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer's new action film, "The Sum of All Fears."
0.375 <|###|> ...post-September 11, "The Sum Of All Fears" seems more tacky and reprehensible, manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves.
0.625 <|###|> takes on a gut-churning immediacy that is hard to deny
0.75 <|###|> Sum" is Jack Ryan's "do-over." Give credit to everyone from Robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works. Especially give credit to Affleck.
0.8 <|###|> Action-packed and exciting!
0.71 <|###|> A tense, capably-made film that's exciting and realistic enough to satisfy filmgoers who've had their fill of Hollywood's usual ultra-unrealistic blockbuster fare.
0.0 <|###|> I've felt more drama watching tornado chasers on The Weather Channel.
0.5 <|###|> Retreads a lot of familiar elements from other "international thrillers" while occasionally dipping its foot into the real-life horror of terrorism.
0.2 <|###|> Affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into, a role that Ford effortlessly filled with authority.
0.5 <|###|> The film doesn't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously, it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA.
0.75 <|###|> It's been eight years since Clear and Present Danger, but this late-blooming entry shows that none of the luster has worn off the series.
0.5 <|###|> Is Ben Affleck such an indispensable talent -- or box-office draw -- that his presence is worth wrecking an entire film franchise to accomodate his youth?
0.6 <|###|> Affleck gets better with each film. It will be interesting to see him age with the Jack Ryan role.
0.2 <|###|> Never in film history will there be a more nonchalant nuclear holocaust.
0.4 <|###|> Gimmicky sci-fi, outer space B-flick.
0.4 <|###|> Very bad special effects mar this only-average s-f excursion. Only the giant rat-bat-whatever creature has any flair.
0.4 <|###|> They don't make 'em like this anymore. It's easy to see why.
0.875 <|###|> The Panic in the Needle Park rolls up the drug culture's sleeve and picks at the scabs underneath.
0.6 <|###|> An occasion to meditate upon the frightfulness of heroin addiction and why many youth opt for the euphoria of white powder rather than the promises of the American dream.
0.6 <|###|> More a character study than any kind of narrative story, it's moderately worthwhile but far from a classic.
1.0 <|###|> Alem de contar com as estupendas atuacoes de Winn e Pacino (em sua brilhante estreia no Cinema), este ainda e um dos melhores filmes ja produzidos sobre dependencia quimica.
0.875 <|###|> It is not filled with quick cutting or gimmicky editing, but Jerry Schatzberg's direction is so confident that we cover the ground effortlessly.
0.6 <|###|> A bizarre mixture of streetwise raunch and starry-eyed ingenuousness.
0.7 <|###|> There's nothing sweet about this very strange character, Jerri, but you still can't wait to see what outrageous thing she'll do next.
0.625 <|###|> In spite of its demented flavor, the movie surprisingly doesn't push the envelope the way the series did.
0.75 <|###|> Amy Sedaris suits up as everyone's favorite former-prostitute/drug addict-turned-high school student in the long-awaited--and quite funny--big-screen version of the cult TV series.
0.6 <|###|> Clever and undeniably peculiar, Strangers with Candy suffers from both a complete lack of focus and a terminal case of self-satisfaction.
0.79 <|###|> Connoisseurs of the show likely relish the induced awkwardness and off-kilter rhythms of the piece; a good part of its appeal was the blank and baffled looks it induced in the uninitiated.
0.75 <|###|> Walks a fine line of comedic self-awareness, and only on occasion loses us in a haze of condescending wit.
0.6 <|###|> This plays like a 'Season One' DVD, silly moments interspersed with lots of dull plot and lame high-school send-up situations.
0.8 <|###|> Like the classic comedies of Chaplin, Hawks and Woody Allen, Strangers With Candy is more than just a good subjective comedy -- it's a great objective film.
0.625 <|###|> The key to its success -- at least whatever success it can muster -- is the manic work of Amy Sedaris.
0.7 <|###|> Fans of the show will rejoice and a few newbies will become converts.
0.75 <|###|> I laughed my gluteus maximus off while watching.
0.5 <|###|> Stretched to feature length, it's not consistently funny, but there are inspired moments and whipsmart lines that suggest how good the show was.
0.625 <|###|> Audiences should find the film brilliant or repellent. At the most interesting moments, it's a bit of both.
0.625 <|###|> The film is probably destined to be a cult success at best, since the TV program was an acquired taste and could be a little much, even when limited to 30 minutes.
0.75 <|###|> The highlight is Sedaris, unflinching as she throws herself into Jerri's clueless optimism.
0.5 <|###|> A half-hour sketch with an hour of padding.
0.5 <|###|> It's a one-joke film that thinks its joke is funnier than it is and runs it into the ground, but not before getting a few laughs.
0.375 <|###|> Jerri up close, with her geek grin and potty mouth, is testing.
0.625 <|###|> That the filmmakers struggle dragging the idea out to feature length is hardly surprising.
0.625 <|###|> We get Colbert, and we get Sedaris as Jerri Blank for just a little while longer. That's enough for us.
0.625 <|###|> Some things were meant to be seen in small doses or on small screens. For all its subversive perks and quirks, Strangers is one of them.
0.75 <|###|> If Steve Martin was right, and "comedy is not pretty," then Amy Sedaris' Jerri Blank must be the funniest character on the planet.
0.5 <|###|> The series' unflagging cynicism was a dead end that now seems callow and perhaps even insincere, considering the political engagement displayed by co-creator Stephen Colbert in his new persona as a faux conservative news commentator.
0.75 <|###|> The school is like none you've seen on screen before. Mary Katherine Gallagher would 'love, love, LOVE!' it, as do I.
0.7 <|###|> Thanks to the comic genius of Sedaris, Strangers With Candy is a good thing -- as long as your taste buds can handle the politically incorrect aftertaste.
0.75 <|###|> Sure, you may cringe, or shudder, or even wonder when your tastes became quite this puerile, but Strangers With Candy is a long-awaited treasure of ludicrousness with very few dead spots.
0.625 <|###|> Flaws and all, Strangers with Candy has one invaluable thing going for it: the utterly fearless and downright brilliant comic performance of Amy Sedaris.
0.5 <|###|> Maybe a half-hour dose was just right, because the film's pacing is torpid and many of the jokes fall flat.
0.5 <|###|> It's so brilliant in places that it can make a viewer root for it, but that's not exactly the same as enjoying it, not really.
0.7 <|###|> The value of a film like Space Buddies... is whether you can watch it and enjoy it with your kids. And the answer to this question is a resounding yes.
0.6 <|###|> One small step for dogkind, one cute adventure for kids.
0.625 <|###|> ...a disappointingly by-the-numbers drama that rarely lives up to the effectiveness of its performances.
0.4 <|###|> A bore of a memoir.
0.875 <|###|> The winning aspect of this adaptation of a best-selling autobiography is in the director's management of the points of view.
0.5 <|###|> The performances are marvelous, and little moments ring all too true, making Tucker's film rewarding if not illuminating.
0.6 <|###|> It's Broadbent's movie, and he really does go from one-foot-in-the-grave to youthful and crackling-with-charisma on a dime. It's not so much that he does it, but that it seems so effortless and non-ostentatious.
0.8 <|###|> A small, intimate film with numerous flashbacks like this one is trickier than it looks, but ultimately it touches the heart and proves a worthwhile journey perfectly timed for Father's Day.
0.83 <|###|> ...a movie that would probably be better off as a poem.
0.75 <|###|> "Father" handles things with grace, wit and a healthy dose of authenticity, staying true to author Blake Morrison's clear-eyed memoir of the same name.
0.5 <|###|> Frustratingly stagnant at times but ultimately a moving story about a dying father and the son who must come to terms with him.
1.0 <|###|> The film puts forth the idea that the best we ever get are reflections and fragmented images of others, as if we see things entirely through prisms or distorting glass.
0.8 <|###|> Firth gives one of his most stitched-up performances as the adult Blake. Maybe he overdoes it but I don't think so. His aloofness, with its awkward hesitancies and ragged bursts of feeling, means that it's all the more moving when he finally lets go.
0.625 <|###|> When Firth and Broadbent share screen time, it's very watchable. Despite their proximity in real-life ages, they're convincing as son and father.
0.75 <|###|> Everything in Water Lilies is more guarded, more complex and far more interesting than it seems.
0.875 <|###|> In this delicate and understated portrait of selective reminiscence by Shopgirl director Anand Tucker, the now-grown son, played by Colin Firth, returns to the scene of the crime that was his childhood.
0.625 <|###|> When Did You Last See Your Father? is based on a true story, but it still feels contrived.
0.75 <|###|> Though ... well-acted by Firth, Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson, the slow pacing makes it feel as if everyone is walking through a waist-deep bog of emotional reserve.
0.6 <|###|> An unfocused, agonized tear-jerker about loss and mourning but some of the performances are excellent.
0.75 <|###|> A small, beautifully acted piece adapted from the British poet Blake Morrison's memoir.
0.75 <|###|> It is all about cherishing every time you see your father.
0.5 <|###|> Tucker keeps things subdued almost to the point of inertia.
0.7 <|###|> The film is directed and lensed with such subtlety and old-fashioned restraint that you might overlook the exquisite cinematic flourishes throughout.
0.75 <|###|> Strong performances carry this familiar but always intelligent British rites-of-passage story about a philandering doctor and his much-mocked son.
0.75 <|###|> Smartly, Father never ties up all its loose ends, but along the way, it is blessed with dozens of scenes in which a couple of actors connect in ways that feel deeply, humanly real.
0.875 <|###|> It can be painful to watch as it so painstakingly captures the slow process of loss. But it's worth every last teardrop.
0.75 <|###|> A haunting and heartfelt drama that may startle some viewers with sporadic shocks of recognition.
0.6 <|###|> The acting is superior in a rather spotty story. Jim Broadbent is a consummate actor who finds the pinpricks in a dry script and sharpens them to magnify Arthur's negative characteristics.
0.875 <|###|> Blake is not ready to let his father go. You'll have trouble letting the movie go too, since the characters are those you grow to care about dearly.
0.75 <|###|> Tucker delivers a stroke of casting so perfect it might seem obvious: Oscar winner Jim Broadbent as the father and Colin Firth as the son.
0.75 <|###|> This is a film of regret, and judging by what we see of the characters, it deserves to be.
0.875 <|###|> The source is Blake Morrison's memoir of the same title, an impressionistic account that the filmmakers -- director Anand Tucker with screenwriter David Nichols -- have cast impeccably and, without losing the nuance, shaped into a strong narrative arc.
0.875 <|###|> The catharsis here is all the more moving because of what wasn't finished, what remained unsaid and what in the answer to the title's question proves unknowable.
0.75 <|###|> There's an air of unfinished business about it all and I'm a sucker for loose ends in the name of family dysfunction.
0.8 <|###|> Mature, deeply affecting father-son drama.
0.5 <|###|> Even as it explores familiar deceits and self-delusions, When Did You Last See Your Father? feels, in the end, as if it's entangled in them.
0.7 <|###|> When Did You Last See Your Father?&#8221; is grown-up, civilized fare, even though the whole thing might have been improved with a bit of messiness.
0.375 <|###|> ...a pretentious mess...
0.875 <|###|> With its self-conscious references to the artistic process and to art itself (in a scene that wouldn't be out of place in a Godard project, a character reads Poe's 'The Bells,' almost in its entirety), this is Swanberg's most moving and impressive film...
0.6 <|###|> Alexander the Last, a 72-minute series of loosely connected scenes, follows an actress's lurching conversations and tentative gestures in life and the theater.
0.6 <|###|> Mumblecore has always lived in small moments, sometimes excruciatingly small, but rarely have these moments added up to a memorable takeaway message. Here, they do.
0.7 <|###|> Swanberg aspires to the next level -- in story scope, character development, and artistic commentary -- and just misses the mark.
0.625 <|###|> Part of that restless, productive team of mumblecore savants, Swanberg allows his actors to do what they do best: act.
0.75 <|###|> This is just about the one-billionth movie to lampoon the horror genre, but so what? It's hilarious.
0.5599999999999999 <|###|> Given the talent involved, it's a project that sounds promising (if maybe more than slightly derivative), but it winds up an unfortunate misfire.
0.25 <|###|> The jaw drops at the drought of laughs in the horror spoof "Hell Baby," especially considering the massive amount of comic talent in front of and behind the cameras.
0.5 <|###|> I can't say I didn't laugh during Hell Baby. I just didn't laugh as much as I would have liked to, or as much as I expected to.
0.4 <|###|> Certainly isn't the worst horror comedy of all time (see Transylmania)... But most of it is still pretty bad.
0.5 <|###|> It soon becomes apparent that the filmmakers, many of whom worked together on "The State" and "Reno 911!", aren't committed to their film's main conceit.
0.4 <|###|> [It] rarely dares to be smart, settling instead for familiar gags that would have the Devil himself yawning.
0.375 <|###|> A film that's less than half as funny as its predecessor, and a sliver as clever as the original.
0.125 <|###|> This offensive, crass pastiche makes "Grown Ups 2" look like a paragon of wit and good taste.
0.25 <|###|> Garant and Lennon's attempts at humor are absolutely terrible. It's as though they have no idea what comedy is or how it works. This results in a series of gags that they must think are hilarious, but are actually extremely sad and cringe-worthy.
0.6 <|###|> In the end, the level of delirium is addictive. Getting there, however, is a challenge which may or may not be worth your time.
0.2 <|###|> There are genre satires, and then there are dumb comedies that wish they could qualify for that status.
0.6 <|###|> Its modest (if occasionally gross-out) stabs at genre parody rarely insult our intelligence and even allow for the kind of retro deadpan silliness Mel Brooks used to underline his louder punch lines.
0.4 <|###|> Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon's Hell Baby is a hit-or-miss affair with far more misses than hits.
0.2 <|###|> When you consider that Garant and Lennon make their living as screenwriters for hire, Hell Baby's shoddy script is an unholy mystery.
0.625 <|###|> The filmmakers satirize the often obscenely meaningless ways in which people of a certain socioeconomic strata attempt to launder their white guilt.
0.7 <|###|> Hell Baby is a devilish laugh-riot, providing hellishly indulgent comedy married with lighthearted slapstick comedy - as long as you're into Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant's typical "immature" style.
0.7 <|###|> It's genuinely funny, a condition all too rare in horror-comedies, comedies, and movies written by Lennon and Garant.
0.125 <|###|> Marlon Wayans' A Haunted House no longer can own the title of the worst horror spoof of 2013.
0.4 <|###|> For every joke that works- about ten fall flat.
0.75 <|###|> It doesn't reinvent the wheel after their anarchic sketch comedy show "The State," but funny is funny, and Hell Baby is very, very funny.
0.8 <|###|> An unabashed art film, demanding, with a measured pace and much ambiguity. It does possess some fine acting and a handsome look.
0.7 <|###|> An efficient talking heads doc that celebrates the band without deigning to hagiography.
0.8 <|###|> The Eagles live in both the present and the past.
0.2 <|###|> not even bruce can save this one
0.625 <|###|> By the time the Spartacus-inspired finale rolls around, it's clear we're not meant to take any of this seriously...
0.4 <|###|> Would have benefited greatly from Singer trusting his talent and assembling a Superman movie that attempted to soar beyond the heights previously achieved decades ago.
0.5 <|###|> For all the mountains of kryptonite ranged against him, you never fear for Superman or Lois Lane, never experience anything more intense than the fret of mild peril.
0.6 <|###|> Superman Returns is a great kick start to a potentially knockout new franchise, which ultimately leaves the audience, like the people of Metropolis when its greatest hero returns to the skies, brimming with hope.
0.875 <|###|> None of which would register if Routh weren't a Superman whom if we don't need we can at least feel for.
0.6 <|###|> Underneath its mechanical safety and mild-manners, this movie does have some heart and some muscle. You'll come to like having it around, even if you thought you'd already moved on.
0.7 <|###|> Superman Returns is a bombastic, rousing, explosive burst of summer fun and fantasy, enriched by its predecessors and rejuvenated by the new blood and slavish religious devotion of director Bryan Singer.
0.8 <|###|> Solid and emotionally direct but not the concussive powerhouse many will be hoping for.
0.8 <|###|> the tragedy of 9/11 and Lois' super sex with the 'man of steel' are two major selling points of the film, but they remain as sublimated as Clark Kent's secret identity.
0.875 <|###|> Ignore the hype, ignore the budget, ignore the expectations, sit back, relax and let Superman return.
0.25 <|###|> The Man of Steel as a morally-compromised and ethically-challenged figure has the potential to be quite compelling, but if and only if he is portrayed as confronting his demons in a more meaningful way.
0.75 <|###|> better than 3 and 4
0.75 <|###|> Resembling Reeve both physically and vocally, Routh certainly has large red boots to fill. And he fills them admirably
0.6 <|###|> Yes, the new Superman Returns movie flies. It just doesn't soar.
0.625 <|###|> After nearly 20 years in hiding, one would expect Superman's return to be special. Alas, the most noteworthy thing about director Bryan Singer's new movie is the hype surrounding it.
0.6 <|###|> click to read full review [Greek]
0.5 <|###|> Emphasizes the reasons I don't find Superman all that interesting.
0.8 <|###|> It's been 5 years since Superman (Brandon Routh) left Earth to search for the remains of his home planet Krypton. Upon his return, the Man of Steel discovers a world in turmoil and a changed Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) - engaged to be married and the mothe
0.625 <|###|> The film's weaknesses aside, there is no denying that Singer has pulled out all the stops in his bid to make the biggest, loudest summer blockbuster possible.
0.8 <|###|> Superman returns with a vengeance.
0.75 <|###|> In a time where the youth of this nation are fighting and dying to defend this country, the film argues that each one of us can be super under the right circumstance.
0.5 <|###|> Quite capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound, [but] does so without much care or conviction.
0.8 <|###|> Super return for Superman ...
0.75 <|###|> A good start at revitalizing a dead series. Get rid of Kevin Spacey for the sequel and you might have something spectacular.
0.8 <|###|> As a superhero film it's really extremely impressive, probably higher in quality than even the first X-Men film and right up there with the Spiderman films.
0.8 <|###|> This Superman takes flight like few before and one wonders whether the film's minor flaws mean only that the sequel, like Singer's X2, is destined to become a real classic of the genre.
0.875 <|###|> Romantica, emocionante, trepidante, mistica y entranable, es un digno homenaje al heroe mas grande del mundo y un perfecto ejemplo de que el cine sigue siendo la fabrica de suenos, pues ahora, mas que nunca, es posible creer que un hombre puede volar.
0.6 <|###|> The battle is won: but only just.
0.6 <|###|> Many happy returns, Superman, you've been away too long. Unfortunately, you deserve a lot better than this.
1.0 <|###|> It's all about heart -- not that the spectacle falters; this is the finest popular entertainment since the Rings trilogy closed. Superman doesn't fly -- he soars.
0.4 <|###|> Filme auto-indulgente e sem ritmo que transforma o Homem de Aco em um gala sem personalidade.
0.8 <|###|> The effects are terrific - you will, indeed, believe a man can fly, especially during a showstopping set-piece involving an out-of-control aeroplane.
0.625 <|###|> The plane taking off, flying and nearly crashing into the earth almost serves as a metaphor for the entire Superman Returns experience.
0.8 <|###|> El Hombre de Acero vuela nuevamente y, ademas de Lex Luthor, ahora enfrenta a un nuevo enemigo: el olvido.
0.875 <|###|> Spirited and somewhat bittersweet, Superman Returns remains a fascinating and very entertaining ride most of the way %u2014 though it's probably at least 20 minutes too long for optimum interest.
0.85 <|###|> ...enjoyable enough for the casual fan, and the superinitiated are going to find plenty of details to worry and rub. It's got humor and a reservoir of respect for the character's history and place in American culture.
0.9 <|###|> Five bravos to Bryan Singer and his team for showing us that Superman's heart is commensurate with the power in his muscles. I'm all wrapped up in his cloak.
0.625 <|###|> The Man of Steel returns in body but not quite in spirit.
0.8 <|###|> Its politics are abhorrent to me, but my god, it's such a slick, well-crafted thriller ... that I can't hate it
0.6 <|###|> A tense thriller that holds your attention to the very end. The film is aided by one of Bernard Hermann's better scores.
0.4 <|###|> Tedious remake of a "thriller" that wasn't that thrilling to begin with
1.0 <|###|> Keep-you-up-all-night terrifying!
0.6 <|###|> The remake with De Niro had the most to fear from this superior little thriller!
0.8 <|###|> A classic revenge thriller.
0.875 <|###|> works best as a twisted nail-biter, punctuated brilliantly with an apocalyptic score by Bernard Herrmann
0.4 <|###|> A sempre presente narracao em off e um dos muitos problemas do filme - especialmente se considerarmos que o narrador e justamente um escritor mediocre.
0.4 <|###|> In Fear was made for next to nothing but that is not always a virtue. After an adequate start its storyline goes precisely nowhere.
0.6 <|###|> A lost-in-the-woods horror predominantly set within a car's claustrophobic confines, this is certainly one of the better films of late to play with fear of the dark.
0.8 <|###|> Sometimes the most effective horror films come with the simplest premise and this is certainly the case with Jeremy Lovering's In Fear.
0.4 <|###|> In Fear is a slickly made, impressively pared-down horror/thriller but is too abstract for its own good - it is hard to feel any great emotional identification (or fear) for characters who so sketchily written.
0.8 <|###|> With limited resources [Jeremy Lovering] has created a disturbingly tense and chilling scenario we can all identify with.
0.9 <|###|> For the most part In Fear, largely improvised with the two leads only broadly aware of the general direction of the story, is a quiet triumph.
0.62 <|###|> For all the intense, arm-gripping fun, an all-too-familiar denouement means that, much like their car, it runs out of gas late on.
0.75 <|###|> ... young couple takes a very wrong turn. UK helmer Lovering tightens the screws the old-fashioned way, through atmosphere and suggestion ... (It) possesses a bleakly funny Pinter-esque quality.
0.9 <|###|> A masterful example of lean 'n' mean outdoor nightmare-making that resonates with the same power of Wolf Creek, but without all the torture and gore.
0.6 <|###|> The actors didn't know exactly where the script was going, but their improvised dialogue moves authentically from teasing to discomfort to light jokes about something deeper.
0.95 <|###|> Sometimes, a horror film needs nothing more than the right cast, the right setting, and an elegantly streamlined story to effectively induce dread. Such is the case with In Fear.
0.5 <|###|> This could have worked as a contained horror flick, but when you're sitting there shaking your head over and over at the characters' inexplicable actions, there's very little chance that you're going to sympathize with them or get engaged in their plight.
0.875 <|###|> "In Fear" is an oft-frightening film that stays with you. One of the most accomplished genre offerings of the last few years, it is a must for horror fans and suspense enthusiasts.
0.4 <|###|> There are traces of films such as The Hitcher, House of 1000 Corpses, Joy Ride, and Hush wrapped up in the DNA of In Fear, but unfortunately that DNA is more of a clone than its own identity.
0.8869999999999999 <|###|> Genuinely scary and suspenseful because it leaves room for imagination and doesn't rely on gore or use a "found footage" device.
0.625 <|###|> "In Fear" takes a small task and a hooky premise and runs with them, providing some good jolts over the course of its barely-90-minute length.
0.75 <|###|> A wicked little horror film in which nearly all of the violence takes place in your head, "In Fear" expertly builds terror out of not much more than two people driving around in a car.
0.5 <|###|> We never know Lucy and Tom enough to care about their survival.
0.4 <|###|> As an exercise in stomach-knotting, In Fear is mildly successful [...] All the pieces are in place for a gripping indie horror flick, but [the] film just goes around in circles.
0.8 <|###|> In Fear lets its increasingly rattled characters stew for as long as possible before gradually revealing its hand, improvisation adding to the credibility of the couple's unravelling behaviour.
0.8 <|###|> It's one of the year's best horror movies, full stop.
0.6 <|###|> A smart, disturbing exercise in anxiety.
0.6 <|###|> Runs in circles of queasy inspiration for a good hour. Then follows the not-so-good half hour.
0.6 <|###|> Claustrophobic and creepy, this experiment in contained horror has its moments as just three characters circle around each other.
0.6 <|###|> Spiky, semi-improvised Brit horror singles out director Jeremy Lovering as one to keep a beady eye on.
0.8 <|###|> Reminiscent of classic era John Carpenter, this is British horror at its ruthless, rural best.
0.8 <|###|> Both young actors seem even more promising after the movie than they did before it. Neither was given the full script or knew the story's outcome.
0.8 <|###|> Most writer-directors don't know how to start a film like this, let alone finish it, and as a portrait of two people hopelessly lost and horribly scared it's a haunting watch.
0.8 <|###|> Grips like a 4x4, even as the escalating tension threatens to spin out of control.
0.6 <|###|> There are a few decent jolts en route before it runs out of gas and ideas.
0.6 <|###|> It may be contrived and nothing new plot-wise, but In Fear has atmosphere and enough proper scares to deliver on the promise of its title.
0.8 <|###|> A taut, chilling little horror-thriller making maximum use of minimal resources to tap into our primal fears of the unknown. Plus shredded-nerve turns from an (evidently) adaptable cast.
0.7 <|###|> This is a great film to watch curled up with a date on a dark and stormy night. One thing's for sure- you won't be eager to go on any road trips right after.
0.8 <|###|> Stylishly shot and almost unbearably tense, this is an atmospheric and genuinely scary British chiller with a superb script and a pair of excellent performances from Englert and De Caestecker.
0.6 <|###|> The film would be valuable for collecting this footage... even if its lapses as documentary cinema and storytelling device were far more serious than they are.
0.8 <|###|> A beautiful tribute to a rare artist with an even rarer spirit.
0.7 <|###|> It is the mythic resonance of her story that makes it a worthy subject a documentary. But it is the down-to-earth human touches that make "Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq" worth watching.
0.75 <|###|> "Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq" presents enough teasing glimpses into the dancer's personal and inner life to demand a fuller picture.
0.875 <|###|> LeClerq, who lived her later years with a fierce independence, died in 2001; in this thoughtful, quiet film, she lives on.
0.75 <|###|> As tragedy of the woman whose whole life was the hothouse of the dance -- including narrating her wistful, matter-of-fact letters and journals during treatment -- the doc exploring the myth of Le Clercq will be a balletomane's delight.
0.9 <|###|> Reminds us what the ballet world had for a time.
0.5 <|###|> Afternoon of a Faun is primarily the story of a woman loved, desired, objectified and watched by men.
0.8 <|###|> A fascinating story of American ballet and one of the greatest ballerinas in the world.
1.0 <|###|> Mythic, indeed.
0.875 <|###|> [A] strangely haunting, often heartbreaking new documentary.
0.75 <|###|> What's most fascinating about "Afternoon of a Faun" - and what the movie could spend more time delving into - is ballet's grueling and fleeting nature.
1.0 <|###|> Director Nancy Buirski not only is able to give rare insights into the dance world but a compelling tale of love, friendship and perseverance.
0.75 <|###|> Buirski takes us on an emotional journey, although the start may seem slow to people unfamiliar with the ballet world or Le Clercq's story.
0.6 <|###|> [As Le Clercq falls to polio, director Nancy] Buirski digs up footage from the past of people encased in iron lungs or floating in nebulous wonderlands - outside-the-box visual cues that turn the film momentarily phantasmagoric.
0.875 <|###|> Illuminating, profound and poignant.
0.625 <|###|> Flawed as it is, no balletomane should miss this one.
0.8 <|###|> Classical dance great Jacques d'Amboise calls Tanaquil LeClercq's style a "path to heaven." And this lovely documentary by Nancy Buirski makes clear that he's right.
0.875 <|###|> While it does profile the work of brilliant dancer, the film also contains two complex and moving love stories as well an account of a physically devastating tragedy followed by an extraordinary tale of struggle and survival.
0.4 <|###|> An actor gives writing and directing a try, with the usual results.
0.4 <|###|> It often feels like there are two separate stories featured in this comic book flick but neither of them is particularly interesting.
0.5 <|###|> Across the board Green Lantern is an average experience. There is zero character development, an overly confusing plot and way too much dodgy CGI assaulting the screen.
0.375 <|###|> Not "Jonah Hex" bad...but almost.
0.625 <|###|> "Green Lantern" does have a fair share of problems and yet is not quite as bad as some are making it out to be. It merely gets added to the long list of superhero films as one of the more forgettable ones
0.625 <|###|> I would say that this film is 50/50 good and bad. The stuff that works really works, but the stuff that doesn't work doesn't really work.
0.5 <|###|> There's a bit more character in the extended cut, but the film is still a mess of tones, driven by a Star Wars-like narrative but cut down by a sloppy Transformers feel.
0.3 <|###|> Thinks it is more impressive than it actually is. Faced with over-blown effects, characters look flat and disappear into the background without a whimper, thanks to an insipid script and the film-makers' unwillingness to flesh out anyone but Hal Jordan.
0.7 <|###|> While it doesn't reach the heady heights of Iron Man, it's a worthy addition to DC's movie universe.
0.75 <|###|> In an attempt by the script to be both epic and snarky, director Martin Campbell and actor Ryan Reynolds did the best they could with what they were given to work with.
0.4 <|###|> It drones on, needlessly complicating the story line with too many character relationships and too many dull stretches.
0.5 <|###|> parolo poy proorizontan gia megalyterh yperhrwikh toy kalokairioy, katelhkse na fylaei ta eispraktika nwta twn ypoloipwn sthn Amerikh
0.2 <|###|> You'll need all the navigational help you can get, lantern or otherwise, to make it through this unfocused, CGI-driven mess of a movie.
0.6 <|###|> whereas Marvel's summer movie Thor revelled in its outlandish setting, Green Lantern dithers between realism and all-out fantasy.
0.5 <|###|> I've always considered DC's Green Lantern to be one step too far over the line into "come on, that's just silly" territory. (Fresh, but only just)
0.6 <|###|> Acaba se revelando um passatempo relativamente divertido e agradavel.
0.4 <|###|> Before Hal Jordan's big-screen debut, I'd never heard of the guy. And now, having sat through the confused mess that is Green Lantern, I don't mind if I never hear of him again.
0.4 <|###|> Green Lantern is all CGI sheen and no soul, taking the comic book movie one giant leap backwards in its inept attempt at creating a would be dazzling adventure.
0.4 <|###|> When Green Lantern does get its green groove on, its quite enjoyable... but the film is left sadly lacking due to the way it fumbles its set-up.
0.5 <|###|> The green aesthetic misfires: the whole film looks as if it's been inspired by a particular shade of washing-up liquid, or the glowing screens of ancient computers.
0.6 <|###|> Things improve as the plot kicks in, thanks to enjoyable performances from Peter Sarsgaard, as the more-or-less human villain, and Blake Lively as the feisty heroine.
0.5 <|###|> A certain tone is needed to carry off the script's manifold absurdities. It has to be tongue-in-cheek rather than foot-in-mouth and Reynolds' success rate is intermittent at best.
0.4 <|###|> Apparently Sarsgaard's [character] went to high school with the characters played by Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively, which is perhaps the only joke in the movie to actually land.
0.625 <|###|> Everything fits together just well enough to work, but not enough to excel.
0.2 <|###|> If serendipity is a collision of happy accidents that produce something greater than the sum of their parts, then The Green Lantern is its unlucky antonym, a film far less impressive than its superior individual ingredients.
0.4 <|###|> Robbed of his personal pronoun by a pan-galactic evil ...
0.5 <|###|> The screenplay isn't as bright as those of other superhero films. But "Green Lantern" isn't a dim bulb of a movie, either.
0.4 <|###|> The film also needs a jump-start or a new Central Battery sometimes that Reynolds alone simply cannot provide.
0.65 <|###|> There's a good movie in there somewhere and enough of it shines through that Green Lantern is not an out-and-out failure. But that realization also makes it a bit of a disappointment; it's easy to see the promise that hasn't been lived up to.
0.6 <|###|> ... the movie finds its bearings once Reynolds takes center screen; the franchise would do well to depend on him more than on sci-fi mumbo jumbo.
0.625 <|###|> ...an overlong and thoroughly uneven big-budget blockbuster that just barely earns a passing grade...
0.2 <|###|> A muddled mess of a superhero film swathed in layer upon layer of (fairly necessary) exposition and burdened by a seriocomic turn by lead Ryan Reynolds.
0.5 <|###|> Not even Ryan Reynolds' charm, which pours out of the actor like water over Niagara Falls, can overcome the lumpy narrative and special-effects overkill.
0.5 <|###|> Lantern proves it's not easy being green.
0.4 <|###|> Green Lantern is a moronic superhero. Ryan Reynolds is too cool to play such a lame character. There...I said it.
0.125 <|###|> A parlor game could be made out of how many times the word "fear" is uttered in Martin Campbell's superhero franchise non-starter.
0.6 <|###|> Green Lantern makes an effort to differentiate itself on an aesthetic level, but otherwise it's what you'd expect - a special-effects bonanza following formula.
0.5 <|###|> This is just one 'been there done that' super hero movie too many in a summer crowded with super hero movies.
0.5 <|###|> The script is pretty dry and many of the scenes between Reynolds and Blake Lively don't work at all. It's a shame that the script doesn't give Reynolds the kind of winking humor that Thor had, and that he is so good at delivering.
0.625 <|###|> Green Lantern is reminiscent of 2008's The Incredible Hulk, another superhero flick that boasted a strong cast but went overboard on visual stimuli.
0.8 <|###|> A most welcome, utterly delightful treat.
