770670866 <###> Secret Beyond the Door <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.4 <###> The result is heavy going and pretentious.
770670866 <###> Secret Beyond the Door <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> The most successful aspect of the production is the cinematography, which creates a shadowy world of false appearances, hidden meanings, and elusive truths.
770670866 <###> Secret Beyond the Door <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.4 <###> Borrowing a plot from the Bluebeard legend, and chucking in a load of sub-Freudian hokum, Fritz Lang nonetheless makes a class act of this Gothic psycho-thriller.
770670866 <###> Secret Beyond the Door <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.4 <###> Sloppy effort from Lang late in his career.
770670866 <###> Secret Beyond the Door <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> Mr. Lang is still a director who knows how to turn the obvious, such as locked doors and silent chambers and roving spotlights, into strangely tingling stuff.

563089248 <###> Wrong Turn 2: Dead End <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.8 <###> This is a movie with its heart in the right place, which is beating and bloody in somebody's hand.
563089248 <###> Wrong Turn 2: Dead End <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.375 <###> As the first half is so abominable, color me surprised that the second half is actually good in a nominal way.
563089248 <###> Wrong Turn 2: Dead End <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> Knowing that they're going to be devoured by mutants at some point offered no sympathy for me
563089248 <###> Wrong Turn 2: Dead End <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.8 <###> A fast-paced and completely unapologetic love-letter to the old-school '80s splatter sequels like Friday the 13th Part 2 and Texas Chainsaw 2. (Gory, too!)
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> A terrific watch, and bound to be one of the funniest films of the year, but perhaps a tad indulgent and lacking the emotional resonance that could've escalated it to truly unmissable status.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> A forgiving nature and lots of stamina is needed for this no-holds-barred hedonistic ride into the Roman orgy-style excesses of the 1990s' financial world
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> I genuinely fear an entire generation of young would-be financial gurus seeing this film as their Scarface, reveling in the wish-fulfillment excess while dismissing any and all social commentary or moral condemnation.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Terence Winter's script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn't make these things up.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> It's another variation on Scorsese's favorite kind of a story, the rise and fall. In this case, he and frequent collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio go on a full-out cinematic bender.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Martin Scorsese's finest in more than a decade.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> This much-anticipated chronicle of depravity at once amuses and nauseates.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Full of sex, drugs and amoral characters, but it is fascinating to watch.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> This is a fantastic exploration of greed, money, and a truly flawed character that spent much of the nineties on a jaw-dropping but pernicious thrill-ride.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Plays less as an insightful critique and more as an exercise in indulgence.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> There's a good chance that by the conclusion of Martin Scorsese's intoxicating, raucous, and shamelessly depraved "The Wolf of Wall Street" you're going to want to cleanse yourself through prayer, charity, or whatever it is that you do to feel virtuous.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Funny? Yes. Entertaining? Yes. Flattering? Not in the slightest. Anyone who wants to be in the Jordan Belfort business after watching Wolf must have rocks in their head.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Scorsese seems to have mixed every genre and every tone from all his previous work together in one big three-hour character-driven opus. And the damn thing works.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Wisely, Scorsese torques his opus as a sprawling, outrageous, gross-out comedy of excess. It's Animal House meets Wall Street... [making] us understand how the unbridled fun of a world defined by power, prostitutes and drugs can result in moral abandon.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> His fifth collaboration with DiCaprio sits within the Scorsese back-catalogue like it was always meant to be there.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Martin Scorsese is back at his best with this rollicking update on the gangsters of New York, the mean streets now filled with stockbrokers and share dealers, driven characters in search of the good life the easy way.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> True story: my priest phoned midway through the screening of The Wolf of Wall Street, as if he had sensed - rightly - that I had been revelling too giddily in the debauched antics of disgraced stockbroker Jordan Belfort.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Scorsese's mastery is undeniable; The Wolf of Wall Street is yet another magnum opus.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> It made me not love but utterly loathe Belfort - a moral victory, perhaps, but also something of a problem, because a character who is simply detestable rapidly becomes uninteresting.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> It aims to shock and succeeds. What else does it teach us though?
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> An outrageously black comedy about white-collar crime, unapologetic in delivery and unashamedly graphic in its intensity.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Absorbing performances, stylistic wit, a lacerating and subversive sense of humor: The Wolf of Wall Street delivers all of these in spades
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Spend three hours on Scorsese's Wall Street, and he'll have you convinced: greed isn't just good - it's great.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> This iconoclastic, black with a capital b comedy is the best Hollywood satire since Showgirls. A jocular epic that bitingly indicts excess
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> At times, the film seems almost Hobbitian in its inability to finish a scene that is already well past its natural lifespan.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> At age 71, Martin Scorsese proves with this riotous romp that he's one of the most energetic, audacious filmmakers working in America at the moment.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Is it immoral to celebrate villainy? There's not much point in pretending The Wolf of Wall Street doesn't do that, pretty exuberantly too.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> This is an exhilarating story of decadence and debauchery, made all the more thrilling by DiCaprio's charismatic and physical lead performance.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> For me the film is somehow less than the sum of its parts, with no palpable sense that these men are doing anything more contemptible than living life to the full.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Scorsese's virtuoso filmmaking and DiCaprio keep you gripped for the three hour running time.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Brilliantly directed, beautifully shot and superbly written, this is a riotously entertaining and frequently hilarious drama with an Oscar-worthy central performance from Leonardo DiCaprio.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> DiCaprio's a marvellous fit for the role, and his slimy charisma could charm even the steeliest of souls.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> As a major filmmaker, it's about time Scorsese found some material that stretched his ideas, rather than his audience's patience.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Every time I looked at my watch, the hands seemed to have stayed still.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street does not quite have the subtlety and richness of Scorsese's very best work, but what an incredibly exhilarating film: a deafening and sustained howl of depravity.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Although Martin Scorsese overindulges as much as his subject, this film proves in the cinematic jungle he's still the king.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Scorsese's best film since Casino, his most provocative since Goodfellas and by far the funniest film he's ever made.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> As you watch a numbed man lose all his basic motor skills to a big chemical rush, you can't help feeling that The Wolf Of Wall Street also needed to cut back on the meds.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> No one generates narrative momentum quite like Scorsese when he's in his element, and The Wolf of Wall Street provides the kind of meaty material into which he can really sink his aesthetic claws.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Merry Christmas, everyone! Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio have a special present waiting for us at the movie theaters. It's titled The Wolf of Wall Street.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Though brilliantly written (by Boardwalk Empire's Terence Winter), acted and directed, Wolf is dangerously overlong.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Scorsese's solid 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' based on the true story of a white-collar criminal's excesses, would have been even better if it weren't so ... excessive.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Scorsese Helms Familiar but Effective "Wolf"
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Highly-watchable entertainment that had the potential to be much much more.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> In my humble opinion, this is the best film of 2013.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> ... overlong, repetitive, and like 'The Departed' too often partakes of self-parody ... It's almost as if Scorsese, in his rush to sate every sophomoric urge, ceded the reins to shock-jock Howard Stern.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> ...both a massive disappointment and a missed opportunity.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.05 <###> Without a moral center, "Wolf" seems to revel in this cornucopia of bad behavior.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Nearly three hours of repeated debauchery and nasty deeds fails to bring Goodfellas-style bite and tension to a situation where the worst that can happen to the film's unlikable characters is the possibility of serving time in a cushy jail.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> A cynical, nasty satire about humans regressing to infantile levels. I would love for it to be the final, insane word on indecent power-hungry Wall Street behavior, but you and I both know that probably won't be the case, so trust me, it's okay to laugh.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> We have to take the story's word that what Belfort did was very, very bad and forget that it looks like fun.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Scorsese directs with propulsive purpose, feeding off DiCaprio's manic energy. Their work is fierce and unforgettable.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> No less than a brazenly brash and unabashed middle finger to any and all genteel expectations and sensibilities.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A fun, wild ride that eventually runs out of steam.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Martin Scorsese directs so 1) the performances are incredible, 2) the movie is very long and 3) it is one of the year's best movies.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> While this is the weakest of the five collaborations between Scorsese and DiCaprio, that's not putting any of the blame on the actor's shoulders. He's sensational.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Wickedly funny, smart as a whip, and immensely perceptive, The Wolf of Wall Street shows that being addicted to money is every bit as damaging as addiction to substances, sex, or anything else.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> 'Taxi Driver' diagnosed American sickness as interior and hellish, while 'Wolf' suggests the sickness has spread outward until the culture has become all but immune to the pangs of conscience and shame...
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Most impressive for its reckless, monstrous motion, fueled by energy exciting and rotten.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.88 <###> ...a black comedy that plays less like the Good Fellas on Wall Street it was pre-sold as than Good-Fellas on Merck Cocaine. It is a three-hour bacchanal, a restless and occasionally disjointed movie that feels as raw and rapacious as its protagonist
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> DiCaprio single-handedly makes it worth the significant time commitment, but this is not filmmaking at the level of creativity and panache of the best Scorsese.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> I'm not saying after writing this review I'm going to go pop some Quaaludes, but even for those staunchly opposed to drugs or rampant sex or getting rich, it's impossible not to become absolutely immersed.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Despite my bladder nearly not making it after 3 hours, thankfully the true story of Jordan Belfort kept me completely distracted and entertained at the behest of my bodily needs.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Extremely audacious and also extremely great. "American Hustle," a second-hand knockoff of this sort of movie, has been collecting undeserved critics awards and Oscar buzz for weeks. "Wolf of Wall Street" is the real thing,
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> The kind of sensation that you only get from a master filmmaker and it restores one's faith a little in film for its own sake.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> "The Wolf of Wall Street" is a bacchanal barrage of booze, broads and blow that will have you laughing - or shaking your head - because of its cynically unabashed exuberance.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street is a hilarious, angry, and scathing indictment of greed. It's so funny you might not notice how deep it cuts.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.46 <###> The result is the indulgent treatment of an overindulgent character that feels more Penthouse Forum fantasy than morality tale. Perhaps that's precisely the point.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> It's hard not to feel there is a better revisit of Scorsese's crime gem already in theaters, David O. Russell's American Hustle.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Though "Raging Bull" must still go down as Martin Scorsese's greatest achievement, "The Wolf of Wall Street" makes the race for No. 2 a lot more interesting.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Why would a man cheat people out of millions and then spend it on hookers, 'ludes and stupid pranks? Hey, why wouldn't you?
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> One of the most entertaining films ever made about loathsome men.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> ...while it justifiably indicts the conflict of interest pervasive in the stock broker profession, three hours of all this debauchery is just too much...and to not even mention one victim in 3 hours? That's inexcusable and superficial movie-making.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.2 <###> Too much explicit sex, drugs and profanity
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Imagine walking into a blow-the-roof-off party. Naked ladies galore. Pills popped like Tic Tacs. A game involving a dwarf and a bull's-eye. Crazy fun for a while, right? But then you're stuck there with a bunch of jerks. For three hours.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Scorsese doesn't actively condemn these characters in the way a traditional moralist would... He allows the characters to damn themselves.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Before the rise of the economic echelon currently referred to as the one percent, there was Jordan Belfort ... the one percent of the one percent.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> It's Margot Robbie who emerges as the biggest star in The Wolf Of Wall Street.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> By presenting the bad and the ugly behind Wall Street so unflinchingly, Scorsese crafts an insightful and important deconstruction of post-millennial America's moral erosion.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.375 <###> Excess for the sake of excess on the part of Scorsese, and it's a bore.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> From a film-making perspective, much of what is here is masterful, and let's face it, we expect nothing less from Scorsese.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.45 <###> Less a cautionary tale and more of a how-to manual... Many sequences take on a sophomoric quality reminiscent of two guys in a bar trying to impress each other with wild stories of depraved drunken debauchery.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> DiCaprio captures this cynical and unsympathetic character effortlessly, and Jonah Hill provides crude comic relief as his nebbishy partner in crime.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> As Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker who spent years cheerfully defrauding investors, DiCaprio is positively reptilian; he spits out his lines with a nasty glee. You're both horrified and enchanted by this creature - a monster in Armani.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Like a hyperactive three-year-old. Sure, for a little while the over-the-top antics and outrageous moments are cute, but after three hours, it becomes exhausting and annoying leaving you simply waiting for it to finally be put to bed.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> It's like "Goodfellas," only (slightly) more legal, which is very much the point.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> My first thought after the credits rolled on Martin Scorsese's 3-hour symphony of greed and depravity was, "How in the hell did this not get an NC-17 rating"???
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> In The Wolf of Wall Street, Scorsese recognized a story of insanity, lewdness, depravity, greed and incredible entertainment value, and that's exactly what he has brought to the screen.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.55 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street is a testosterone fueled, hallucinogenic fever dream driven by verbose dialogue, sweaty prostitute sex, and snorting cocaine from an unsuspecting rectum.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Scorsese, as always, knows exactly what he is doing. Although it's long, the movie is never less than entertaining.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> It does for stockbrokers what GoodFellas did for mobsters.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> As entertaining as many of the individual scenes and set pieces can be, the movie drags as it passes the 90-minute mark.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Scorsese presents Belfort as a charismatic Caligula. He is an endlessly fascinating character who holds viewers' attention from beginning to end.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> "The Wolf of Wall Street" is a fleet-footed three hours of startling moments, 99 percent of them hedonistic and hilarious.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Scorsese moves through this cavalcade of bad behavior like a kid in a candy store.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street isn't a celebration of bad behavior: It's a condemnation.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Rests comfortably alongside Scorsese's masterpieces Goodfellas and Casino, but carries a sting that even they don't by examining the most acceptable, yet most rapacious, of criminal swindles.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> It becomes unclear who has too many balls in the air -- the character of Belfort, or the film's director. Either way, there's a crash waiting to happen.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> "The Wolf of Wall Street" remains one-note even at is most outre, an episodic portrait of rapaciousness in which decadence escalates into debauchery escalates into depravity - but, miraculously, not death.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The film looks beautiful; the loose editing creates an overlong but still compelling structure; and Scorsese finesses the way the film pulses -- like Belfort's racing heart -- with a dangerous jazzy rhythm.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It's showy, but it doesn't amount to much.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Overlong by an hour and overindulgent by infinity, Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street entertains at times but mostly numbs.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> So it's a relief and a pleasant surprise that Wall Street, despite some missteps and the need for an editor, mostly manages to live up to the interest generated by its kinetic trailers and the heavy hand of hype.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> If you're down with a character arc that's as short as a crack pipe and equally resistant to temperance, then Martin Scorsese's latest picture is your chance to howl.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Oh, my, my. Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street is outrageous, an offense against modesty, a shameless celebration of bad conduct.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Wild, offbeat and insane, "The Wolf of Wall Street" is one of the year's best films and a definite career-topper for DiCaprio who, with Scorsese, have given us another phenomenal collaboration
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> There's a certain hollowness to Scorsese's rags-to-riches-to-plea-bargaining tales. A hangover quality. It's less noticeable in "Wolf" because of the sheer force of DiCaprio's portrayal.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> As thrilling a filmmaker as Martin Scorsese continues to be, and as wild a performance as Leonardo DiCaprio dishes up as its morally bankrupt master of the universe, The Wolf of Wall Street seems almost entirely unnecessary.
771305721 <###> The Wolf of Wall Street <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> An unbridled tale of drug fueled sex and avarice, The Wolf of Wall Street moves like a breeze for its three hour runtime.

771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Driven by the blustery, swear-happy, cadence-free performances that characterise most Seth Rogen comedies, this reasonably funny lark at least has the distinction of mixing in some light political satire with the usual knockabout fare we've come to expect

771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> More tasteless farce than blistering satire, The Interview is a relatively innocuous comedy...
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The Interview at its best is just intermittently amusing, with an obsession about the sanctity of bottoms. These boys need to stop clenching.

771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> As a spoof on popular culture and politics, it's naughty, dumb and patchily funny. And while Franco chews the scenery, Rogen and Park display excellent comic timing.

771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> It's the best thing both Franco and his co-star Seth Rogen have done in what feels like years: a raucous, abrasive, snort-out-loud satire with mischief in its heart and methane in its gut.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Unfortunately, it grieves me to report that The Interview just ain't very funny.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The humour is mostly crotch-level and initial bonhomie gives way to tiresome violence in a largely joke-free finale.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Park is sharp, funny and oddly sweet as the dictator but, even with a toned-down assassination sequence, the movie is a throwaway, worthier of a few laughs than it is a full-on international furor.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> A comedy fatally short on laughs.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The movie more or less vaporizes the Supreme Leader in graphic slow motion... This is the special-effects shot heard 'round the world, judging by its reverberations in the arenas of entertainment, politics and the news media.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's dumb humor, all right. But it also follows a long cultural precedent of using schoolyard scatological jeers to bring down the mighty.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Determinedly silly...[but the] undisciplined frat-bro comedy's accumulation of innuendos, boner jokes, gay jokes, and gags that tread through racist and misogynist territory works out to less than the sum of the juvenile parts.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Whether or not the film strikes a blow for free speech, it most certainly strikes one for lowbrow humor and dubious taste.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It's funny, both as a bro-buddy comedy with many jokes sourced from the underwear region, and as an opportunity to put the "political" in "political incorrectness."
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The Interview might be a cause celebre, whose temporary shelving by Sony was treated as a free speech issue, but it is a broad, somewhat laboured comedy.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The Interview, symbol though it's become, ain't nothing but a movie.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> For those of us cynics anticipating the abominable, The Interview could come as quite the letdown. It has its moments. But make no mistake: this is adolescent, frat-house humour. Think Animal House meets Rambo.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The Interview's jokes fall flat not because they're stupid, but because the stupidity doesn't rise to the occasion.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It is indeed a lowbrow comedy, but it's not just some dumb movie - and the fictitious assassination of a living world leader is not even the most dangerous thing about it.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Like an amateur with a shotgun, the movie fires everything it can at the screen without ever hitting a target.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Te best satire provokes and even outrages, and Rogen, Franco and Goldberg certainly succeed on that score.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> This maintains a level of hilarity on par with "Pineapple Express" and "This is the End." Everybody...just relax, and let yourself have a good laugh.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Much more about friendship and loyalty than it is about killing a foreign leader or even making fun of one ... As satire it is very broad; as broad comedy it is surprisingly, and pleasingly, smart.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The Interview may be caught up in turmoil -- considering how smart it is about how dumb we can be when pop culture meets politics, that's pretty funny -- but it's also a funny, risky and well-done comedy far ahead of most of its studio peers.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Strip away the butt jokes, and there's a comic satire of power-mad idiocy on a level with "Dr. Strangelove" or "Duck Soup."
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> A great reminder why we should never go to war over a Seth Rogen movie, but we should go to the Cineplex for one.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A silly, sloppy and sophomoric slob-comedy...to paraphrase Shakespeare, it's much ado about very little.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> This is what all the fuss was about?
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> The film feels like a Saturday Night Live sketch that went longer than it should with the writers having no where to go after the laugh meter reached it peak early.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Somewhat funny, mostly pointless, definitely questionable, and arguably harmless.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It's stupid. It's in bad taste. It impossible. I know all that. But Rogen's instinct to try anything for giggles and sticking it to dictatorial assholes is worth fighting for. Screw Kim if he can't take a joke.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> "The Interview" is something of a disappointment, and I'm not just saying that because North Korea has gotten its Internet back up.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Everyone here is in way over his or her head.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Bluntly funny and ever-so-slightly sweet.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> There's a whip-smart, pointed comedy in "The Interview." Unfortunately it's buried in there. Really deep.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It will go down in history. Not a bad fate for a totally undistinguished juvenile comedy with the nubbiest of satirical teeth.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> If you didn't see this in a theater, you cheated. And cheated yourself.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> A toothless, brainless comedic misfire that's low on laughs, wit and clever satire. If you're expecting this to become a cult classic comedy, you'll be sorely disappointed.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Some people might regard watching The Interview as an act of patriotism, but really it's just a mildly amusing way to pass the time.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> If anything, The Interview is too obvious in terms of its insights and too imprecise in terms of the humor it uses to bolster them.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> With so much controversy clouding just about everything with this rather sophomoric comedy, it may be easy to overlook the nuts it took to make it in the first place.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Rogen and Franco have an easy chemistry that never fails to entertain, but The Interview is the dumbest and least continuously funny film they've been involved with to date.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Imagine "Harold and Kumar Go to North Korea," or "Bill and Ted's Excellent North Korean Adventure" or even "The Road to Pyongyang" starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. You get the idea.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> There's a story hidden underneath all this incessant riffing that could have made a poignant statement about modern politics and celebrity if the movie had dared to actually follow it through.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> In a less politically sensitive time, Randall Park's flat-out brilliant performance would be hailed as the breakout, star-making, even awards nomination-worthy, turn that it is.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> For all the controversy, in the end, the funniest thing about The Interview may be people's "Is that what the fuss was about?" response to the finished product.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Randall Park, who plays Kim, is a riot throughout.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> "The Interview" struggles to really illuminate anything about the stranger-than-fiction Orwellian nightmare that is North Korea, but its attempt is admirable. It deserves to be seen.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It's just stupid enough that some things are funny. Sadly, it isn't smart enough to realize that other things aren't terribly funny and that an opportunity was lost here.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It may be profane and sloppy and silly and insulting to the North Koreans, but The Interview is a guilty pleasure.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> That something so carefully slapdash and happily juvenile actually resulted in cyber-sabotage and threats of violence is, in itself, an enormous kind of joke. Too bad it's the biggest one here.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Hate to say it, but this film ain't half the satire it could have been.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> In their third film together, Franco and Rogen have a terrific banter and an underlay of affection. This kind of rapport is rare.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Yes, there have been terrorist threats over a Seth Rogen movie with a Guinness-level number of anus jokes.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Like their affable, ignorant characters, Rogen and Franco seem in way over their heads with "The Interview."
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The Interview confirms Rogen as the most ambitious mainstream comedian in Hollywood.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> It essentially uses a major global issue to cheaply dress up what is two hours of hit-and-miss erection jokes.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.78 <###> Though its unlikely to stand out as one of the shrewdest political satires of its time, [it] is a clever, unrestrained -- and most importantly -- sidesplitting parody that pokes fun at both a vapid media and one of the world's most dangerous dictators.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Putting two American dinguses in North Korea is rich source material for racial stereotyping, but the jokes are, by and large, self-aware.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The Interview flirts with some fascinating moral and societal subtexts but uses unrelated jokes as a crutch.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.85 <###> Hilarious, but it's probably going to get us nuked.
771353053 <###> The Interview <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The Interview fails to live up to the hype, floundering as a rowdy comedy as it grows duller by the minute.
12019 <###> White Hunter Black Heart <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> An ambitious and intriguing project that never amounts to anything more than the sum of its parts--a trait shared by many of Eastwood's other major project as an independent filmmaker, Bird.
12019 <###> White Hunter Black Heart <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Clint Eastwood raises hell and finds his heart of darkness.

12019 <###> White Hunter Black Heart <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> One of Eastwood's finest achievements.
12019 <###> White Hunter Black Heart <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Slow-moving but gently engrossing.
12019 <###> White Hunter Black Heart <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> Wilson, obsessed with the Alpha male art of Hemingway and Melville, is portrayed as a man driven by society's outsized notions of XY-dom.
12019 <###> White Hunter Black Heart <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> One of Clint Eastwood's best.

12019 <###> White Hunter Black Heart <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Tragically underrated, the character of John Wilson remains one of Clint Eastwood's greatest roles, standing next to Dirty Harry in memorability.
12019 <###> White Hunter Black Heart <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> A fascinating look at a macho man who lived life fully and his own way.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Jamie Chung gives a reserved, watchful performance, but the true surprise is perpetual nice guy Beau Bridges in a nasty turn as the head trafficker.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Eden surprises by managing to paint a vivid and disturbing picture of the trafficking experience within the context of a conventional thriller.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Griffiths handles the exploitation with care, hinting at what goes on rather than rubbing our faces in it.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> It's based on the experiences of a real life Korean woman, Chong Kim, but you can just tell that many of the facts have been massaged.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Harrowing true events are dramatised with surprising restraint in the low-key Eden.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> I would have liked to know more about the criminal setup, though leaving it unexplained gives it a greater tang of evil: a very strong performance from Chung.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Engaging, sharply focussed and pointedly non-exploitative sex trafficking drama with a strong script, assured direction and a terrific central performance from Jamie Chung.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Props to Griffiths for proving that it only takes a very slight shift in tone and focus to give a gory old bike a set of shiny new wheels.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> For half an hour, with brutish hunks abusing teens in torn clothes, we think: "Sexploitation!" Then stately, plump Beau Bridges appears, a corrupt federal marshal resembling a gone-to-girth Timothy Spall, and the story starts.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Director-cowriter Megan Griffiths refuses to sensationalise the tabloid aspects of this harrowing true story about human trafficking within the USA.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> A frustratingly mild interpretation of a horrific true-life incident.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Director Megan Griffiths wastes a great villain and settles for easy answers in a watchable but by-numbers thriller.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Cruelty, bloodletting and death are evident throughout (frequently occurring just outside the frame), and Griffith's laudable discretion actually intensifies their impact.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Griffiths lays bare a many-tentacled trafficking system sickening in its reach.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> The intimate scenes between marginalized individuals feeling out complicated relationships. . .gives unusually poignant insight into those caught up in sex trafficking.
771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.25 <###> Nearly every second is taken up with the horrors inflicted upon the heroine by the sorriest bunch of good ol' boy sadists since "Deliverance."

771271074 <###> Eden <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The "male gaze" that often despicably and hypocritically surfaces in these kinds of films is pointedly absent throughout.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> If this is what the future holds for both franchises, then today's youngsters are welcome to it.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Aliens VS Predator - Requiem is the second film in the over hyped and under performing crossover series, which brings nothing new to the table while tarnishing the franchises' original films.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> In a word, repugnant.

769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Too underlit to qualify as splatter, too bloodless to qualify as fun, too unaware of its own idiocy to be enjoyed Grindhouse-style, AvP:R is a real education in the finer stratifications of badness.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> Does Alien vs. Predator: Requiem spell the end of the dual-monster franchise? Let's hope so

769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> Well, there's not much to see here. And I mean that literally.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Un spectacle insipide, ennuyant a mourir et de tres mauvais gout
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> I'm left wondering why I felt like I was watching two different movies that never quite came together as a parallel arc beyond the clunky "They're all fighting personal wars" motif...
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem is literally shrouded in darkness, and the only explicable reason for this pitch-black visual schema is that the filmmakers understood it was better if no one could see the **** they were shooting.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> With a spike in the gore quotient, hardcore fans left baying for Paul WS Anderson's blood after the first AVP may be happy. Those interested in anything more than a barely comprehensible bitch-slap between two ill-treated icons should take a rain-check.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> The world's most illogical and boring action-horror grudge-match between two dull trademarked franchise monsters is back on.

769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> This feature directing debut from former visual effects men Colin and Greg is enjoyable enough in rudimentary tension/splatter/scrap terms, but it still doesn't live up to its heritage.

769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> ... why not just film an intergalactic reality show where eager young predators can prove their worth for fabulous prizes by surviving 24 hours on the alien homeworld?
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> The Old School nondigital face-huggings and chest-burstings don't compensate for the Sci Fi network dialogue and story logic.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Fez com que eu percebesse que, de repente, estar no meio de uma guerra entre duas criaturas mortais pode nao ser um destino tao horrivel como eu imaginava. Ao menos, eu estaria livre de acompanhar esta serie.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> The film is competently executed, occasionally scary and frequently fun to watch, no matter whether you choose to laugh at or with it.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Taking a cue from the Requiem of the title, it may be time to put these Aliens and Predators to rest once and for all.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Mean-spirited, gloomy and ineptly made by the Brothers Strause, who here find themselves promoted from special-effects experts to filmmakers (in name at least).
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Left a bland aftertaste in my mind.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.1 <###> A worse AVP film than the first one just couldn't be made. Except that, impossibly, it has.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.0 <###> Not so much a movie as much as it is a series of blurs and shapes moving quickly across a screen.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Indifference is the name of the game across the board, really.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> I can't say for sure what the 'Requiem' in the film's title refers to, though we can only hope it means it will be the last in the series.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> Ho, ho, ho -- the joke's on anyone who pays to see this.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Delivers what it promises and not much more.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Chocolate-and-peanut-butter franchise mash-up corrects its most recent predecessor's PG-13 rating, but offers up neither originality nor knockout execution.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> It may not be classic sci-fi like the original Alien, which it has in its DNA, but it's a perfectly respectable next step in the series.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> The action is rendered with such disconcertingly low light levels -- and of course there is heavy rain for the climatic sequences -- that it can be a strain to simply see what is occurring on-screen. Then again, maybe that's for the best.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> That the first of many rote 'chest-burster' shots occurs 15 seconds into the movie is but one indication of the latest instalment's poverty of fresh shocks and rank air of desperation.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.125 <###> The problems with the movie are twofold and easy to spot: the acting stinks and you can't understand what's going on.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> This isn't so much an Alien or Predator styled flick we were all hoping for. Instead, half of the plot plays out like a John Hughes nightmare circa 1988.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> It makes Alien Vs. Predator look like Alien or Predator by comparison.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> If your ONLY complaint about Alien vs. Predator is that it wasn't graphically violent enough, then you're going to love this movie.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> What better way to celebrate Christ's birth than watching two warring alien races kicking the holy hell out of each other?
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Scares are few and far between. Suspense is in short supply. As for the battle sequences pitting the slimy aliens against the metal-geared predator, they are plentiful but forgettable, nondescript freneticism shot in murky lighting.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> A perfect example of how studio stupidity and fanboy obsession can ruin cinema.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> Despite what the harsher R-rating recommends, it's not really advisable that anyone over the age of 17 see this movie.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> A movie every bit as awkward and laborious as its unwieldy, ridiculous title.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> An uninventive, unexciting and ultimately ineffective follow-up ... We can only hope that the sub-title means that this moneymaking farce is finally over.
769772568 <###> Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Respectable attempt to revive these two flagging franchises fares only slightly better than its predecessor, but still fails to generate an ounce of suspense or thrills.

17258 <###> Margaret Cho - Notorious C.H.O. <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> In her first picture, she was as shrill as fingers across a blackboard. Much less shrill and repetitive this time, her act is more inviting to non-fans. Even so, I found it more cute than funny. I never laughed.

749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> By no means is this lukewarm drama Woody Allen's worst work, but it's no dream, either.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Farrell and McGregor bring much to their roles...to make Cassandra's Dream an effective and chilling ride.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Cassandra's Dream is, in fact, not the worst film in the Woodman's oeuvre. But it does tend to underline his weaknesses.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> It's enough to make you pine for the good old days -- back when life was only partly ironic and Woody was totally funny.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> Woody Allen still insists on making movies at the rate of one a year, but he clearly needs to slow down. A lot.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Disappointing, badly overwritten drama from Woody Allen, rendered almost unwatchable by dreadful Cockney accents from McGregor and Farrell.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> At this point, I guess we should just applaud Allen for his work ethic.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Allen is notorious for not giving his actors explicit instructions, and yet somehow this worked wonders for Farrell, who has never seemed so naked, so clear and so unencumbered as he does here.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The problem is, you don't feel the human sweat and strain in Cassandra's Dream, despite game work from Farrell and McGregor. There are plenty of ideas and themes and no people of distinctive interest to enliven them.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Although all the performances are remarkable, the actors can't break free from the too neat-and-tidy script.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> A clumsy, cliched morality play that may actually represent the lowest point of Allen's recently chequered career.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Woody Allen's neurotic-speak works wonders coming from a New Yorker, but coming from a Brit? Not so much.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> This is Colin Farrell's best work in years and proof that Woody Allen is an old dog, and these are new tricks.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.79 <###> Every Woody Allen movie becomes an occasion to discuss what went wrong with Woody Allen movies. My own theory is that Allen simply became too efficient at getting his movies made %u2014 he works quickly and cheaply and he never has to convince his backers
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Woody Allen vuelve sobre ciertos temas de algunas de sus mejores obras (Crimenes y Pecados, Match Point), pero esta vez sin una gran historia que los sustente.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> CASSANDRA'S DREAM is a slow moving character thriller, that isn't always surprising, but for me was very involving. Woody has done it again!
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> There is an effortless artistry in this film that may have deceived many. It looks like a trifle but it packs a punch.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Two years after Match Point, Allen delivers another London-set murder melodrama, with diminishing returns. [DVD]
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> The film stumbles in its convenient, obvious plot turns, even if much of this is meaningfully thought-provoking.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Acaba se boicotando gracas ao desfecho simplista e artificial.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> While Allen's Match Point was an interesting switching of gears ... his new mantle of Patricia Highsmith-esque crime chronicler is wearing thin as well.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Allen comes to the nature of God's omnipresence so often, without varying on either his question or his answers, that his films have increasingly become copies of earlier works, degrading in quality further and further from the original with each successi
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> For those who remember [his Allen's classic films] Cassandra's Dream seems like the work of an imposter.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Cassandra's Dream is second-rate Allen, but it's still compelling thanks to its magnetic co-stars.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> It's not completely awful. But it lacks the necessary suspense and the only thing that really holds it together are the performances.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Cassandra's Dream lacks energy and spark. Monotonous and simplistic, it is definitely not worthy of Woody Allen.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> A clutch of disturbingly weak performances stumbling over uncharacteristically terrible dialogue.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Allen, who stays behind the camera, brings too little wit and too much contrivance to material that quickly dissolves into warmed-over Dostoevski.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Farrell and McGregor deliver remarkably nuanced performances in and through their mundane one-dimensionality, taking average Joes and give them average strengths and weaknesses.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Cassandra's Dream is like a dream, all right&#151;a bad one, made by an aging filmmaker who, sadly, simply doesn't have the same magic he once did.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> Colin Farrell, Ewan McGregor, and Tom Wilkinson catch Woody Allen at the top of his game. The result is Allen's best work to date, and Farrell's best performance.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> Woody Allen's style here is expressly Hitchcockian. The tensions mounted and the ability of the narrative to focus on particular elements that end up meaning nothing put this film in league with the master of suspense.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> [Delivers] a sharply effective jolt of unease. It's a pulp story pinned to the screen with an ice pick of conscience in a manner that would have pleased Allen's idol, Ingmar Bergman.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> A dreary tale of two loser brothers who agree to become assassins in exchange for financial help from their corrupt uncle.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> [The film] forces its characters to ask themselves what they are able to live with and how far they are willing to go to attain personal happiness. It's a worthwhile theme, except Allen has explored it before, in an infinitely more engrossing manner.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The tone feels all wrong.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> If Frida Kahlo can paint 55 self-portraits, Woody Allen can make several versions of the same movie. It's only fair.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> If all [Woody Allen] is going to do is grind out weak, Brit-accented genre pieces that pay homage to 1940s and '50s melodramas, he shouldn't waste the frequent-flier miles.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Allen's storytelling is crisper here than it has been all decade, even if he's making shadow puppets out of the forewarnings.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> Cassandra's Dream, Woody Allen's latest excursion to the dark side of human nature, is good enough that you may wonder why he doesn't just stop making comedies once and for all.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Did Woody Allen kill somebody once? Could somebody check and make sure Tony Roberts is OK?
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> The cast makes the most of Allen's predetermined screenplay.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The identical premise is used in Sidney Lumet's Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, which is like a master class in how Allen goes wrong.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> There's not a believable character, nor line of convincing dialogue to be found.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> The good news about Woody Allen's "Cassandra's Dream" is that it is nowhere near as bad as his recent string of duds. The bad news is that it is nowhere near as good as his best work.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> Trying to balance the demands of his well-meaning motives with the requirements of the genre leaves Allen unsettled and ineffective, two words that encompass the creative drought evident in Cassandra's Dream.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> A surprisingly solid, expertly constructed crime drama.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Writer/director Woody Allen calls on everyone to be a bit too reserved, but Wilkinson and Farrell find ways around it
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> In this unrelenting and uncompromising film, Allen directs with the ease of a master
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> Allen's austere, carefully plotted story is the opposite of a whodunit. It's a why- and how-dunit.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Perched uncomfortably between thriller and melodrama, it's a film that hints at possibilities that are left unfulfilled.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Woody Allen scores with suspenseful adult drama.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> written with an archly intellectual perspective, but brought to poignant life by the actors
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> The slow but steady pace is cumulatively compelling, like the tightening of a noose.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Allen fumbles the execution of a decent setup, with an end to this downward spiraling tragedy that's as puny as the filmmaker himself.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> The impression that lingers is that of an artist clutching fast to yesterday's inspirations.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> If you must see only one film about a family's downward spiral into despair, it probably should be Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, not Cassandra's Dream.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The latest London-based Woody Allen movie is marked by Colin Farrell's best performance in years, and a sluggish, predictable script that covers some familiar crimes and misdemeanors.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> The buildup here is gripping but the story falters as it grinds to an end.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.333333333333 <###> It's admittedly better than some of Allen's DOA comedies of the past decade. To think that his weak attempt at a morality play represents some return to form, however, is a pipe dream.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> As with Match Point, this is a glorified morality play, albeit with less poetic symbolism, shakier performances, predictable plot, and constricting dialogue
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> With Cassandra's Dream, we may finally be seeing confirmation of what many have suspected for years: that Woody Allen's period of greatness as a filmmaker is over.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Are we supposed to be charmed, or shocked, by this? Allen doesn't seem to know.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Me ton Phillip Glass na toy bgazei ti misi doyleia ap' tin ihitiki mpanta, o Woody Allen rihnei mia diaforetiki matia sto thema toy thanatoy, anazitontas ton sto esoteriko toy zontanoy, meso tis allagis poy epiferei sto eksoteriko toy, i dolofonia tis ith
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> If the condescending Allen doesn't offer a context for Ian and Terry's behavior it's because he feels covetousness is a given for the lower-class, and so Cassandra's Dream is simply content reprimanding the brothers for not knowing their place.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.45 <###> Hopefully, Allen has finally gotten the UK out of his system with his latest substandard film.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> A mediocre Woody Allen drama about class, money, sex, and crime.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> This is archly contrived nail-biter territory and an almost giddy strain on our nerves as Allen moves his hapless heroes from bad to far worse.
749215709 <###> Cassandra's Dream <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> An exceedingly well acted and sporadically electrifying little thriller.
10708 <###> The Spook Who Sat by the Door <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.25 <###> Unabashedly bigoted, stridently hateful, it wants to be incendiary and controversial, but only manages thuggish and dull.
10708 <###> The Spook Who Sat by the Door <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.7 <###> So fiery, smart and entertaining that the lack of finesse hardly matters.
10708 <###> The Spook Who Sat by the Door <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> It is such a mixture of passion, humor, hindsight, prophecy, prejudice and reaction that the fact that it's not a very well-made movie, and is seldom convincing as melodrama, is almost beside the point.
9524 <###> Homeward Bound II - Lost in San Francisco <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family <###> 0.4 <###> Definitely not as good as the first.
9524 <###> Homeward Bound II - Lost in San Francisco <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family <###> 0.0 <###> So pathetic, that the filmmakers are not above making gay jokes about animals in San Francisco!
9524 <###> Homeward Bound II - Lost in San Francisco <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family <###> 0.4 <###> Somebody needs to invest in a few leashes.
9524 <###> Homeward Bound II - Lost in San Francisco <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family <###> 0.4 <###> This sequel is serviceable family-market fodder, but even little children might expect something more sophisticated these days.
9524 <###> Homeward Bound II - Lost in San Francisco <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family <###> 0.625 <###> The plot is nothing more than a recycled version of the first one, but hey, it is still funny and there are many great lines.
9524 <###> Homeward Bound II - Lost in San Francisco <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> A silly little trifle with more wisecracks than laughs.
9524 <###> Homeward Bound II - Lost in San Francisco <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> The first movie was good-hearted and I liked it, but since then Babe has raised the bar, with animals that not only talk more realistically, but say things that are wittier and more pungent.
9524 <###> Homeward Bound II - Lost in San Francisco <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Full of the cute doggie tricks, big noisy adventure sequences and the usual anthropomorphic bits of action and dialogue that children will love.
9524 <###> Homeward Bound II - Lost in San Francisco <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> Taken on its own entirely hokey terms, Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco is a charming romp of a talking animal movie.
9524 <###> Homeward Bound II - Lost in San Francisco <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family <###> 0.625 <###> It's more padded than Lassie's bed. But 9-and-unders were having a tail-wagging good time.
9524 <###> Homeward Bound II - Lost in San Francisco <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> It does a better job than most family films in projecting a child's-eye view of a world where siblings and pets are equally cherished members of the family.

770871352 <###> Audrey The Trainwreck <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> We're supposed to see something profound in the mundane details of kitchen, office, bar and bedroom, and to nod knowingly as the designated sympathetic characters endure the hell of after-hours volleyball and bridal showers.

770669970 <###> Blonde Ambition <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> ...despite the presence of Jessica Simpson, Blonde Ambition remains an amiable, almost entertaining piece of work that generally holds the viewer's interest throughout...
770673786 <###> Body Bags <###> Television;Horror <###> 0.6 <###> It's easy to see why Body Bags was something of a clone of Tales from the Crypt. But as a standalone film, Body Bags is Carpenter at his funniest, as director, composer and in his rare appearance as a lead actor.
770673786 <###> Body Bags <###> Television;Horror <###> 0.6 <###> Even with the impressive talent assembled in front of and behind the camera, and a healthy budget for a television movie, Body Bags is still little more than an agreeable lark.
770673786 <###> Body Bags <###> Television;Horror <###> 0.8 <###> See it for Mark Hamill going nutzoid.
770673786 <###> Body Bags <###> Television;Horror <###> 0.6 <###> High-powered modern horror directors and a good cast, but not much to it.
770673786 <###> Body Bags <###> Television;Horror <###> 0.6 <###> Not too shabby, but the masters of the genre could certainly have cooked up something more tasty.
21298 <###> 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Oh, I love this. It's a shame about sound and colour.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Whatever its other sins, the movie cannot be accused of wanting for ambition or scope.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> I appreciate what Perry is trying to do with his films, and it's nice to see an urban film that isn't a "Gangsta Picture", but he needs to tone down the soap opera qualities and let his stories unfold naturally.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> (Tyler) Perry, a cinematic one-man band who wrote the script, produces, directs and plays the role of a decent husband and construction worker, is still growing as a filmmaker.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> To call The Family That Preys a transitional effort would be accurate and fair
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> A simple tale of good versus evil that also delivers solid acting and an enjoyable script
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The closest Perry has come to making something that looks like it belongs on a movie screen and not on a TV set or on the wall of a church basement.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Well, GOod for Ty,ler Perry. He has invented his own genre of movie.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> When he's not distracted trying to accessorize dresses, Tyler Perry can write a decent enough soap opera.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> If all Tyler Perry did with The Family That Preys was give Alfre Woodard a good part, that would be enough to make the movie worth seeing. But he does more.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The Family that Preys shows grand advances in the filmmaking education of playwright-turned-filmmaker Tyler Perry. It's also his soapiest film yet, an overwrought melodrama of sibling rivalry, infidelity, family business power plays and terminal illness.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> To say that the plot is laboriously constructed is an understatement. The first hour is interminable, filled with dead air that suggests Perry the director was asleep at the switch.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The film takes off when Woodard's and Bates' characters go on a Thelma & Louise-style road trip.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The movie plays almost exactly like four daily soap episodes stitched together.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The suds that cascade through Tyler Perry's The Family That Preys more than equal the cubic footage from nighttime soaps like Dallas, Dynasty and their offspring.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> This mix of lovingly-written characters and terribly hokey plots makes for an uneven but occasionally engaging drama.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A smart, satisfying movie experience.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Defiantly old-school, undeniably entertaining, Tyler Perry's The Family That Preys is a shiny, two-timing throwback to 1950s melodramas like Giant, those wellsprings of such prime-time soaps as Dallas and Dynasty.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Thanks to some first-rate acting from its stars, it ranks among Perry's best.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> [Perry] squanders his most impressive cast yet on one of his least compelling stories.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Another pat and predictable cautionary tale which nonetheless manages to push the right emotional buttons. That's the magic of the Tyler Perry genre.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Message-heavy dramedy features fine performances.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Overstuffed and self-indulgent...The Family That Preys is nothing more than a busy-minded, shifty soap opera propelled by its empty-minded sense of indignation.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Tyler Perry has something, there's no doubt. But in The Family That Preys, it's buried under by an avalanche of unbearable, soap opera drivel.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's all rather dull if you don't have laundry to fold while watching.
770771538 <###> The Family That Preys <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A bit slow paced, Perry nevertheless, has proven once again how good of a storyteller he is with 'The Family That Preys'.

771240312 <###> Grandma, a Thousand Times <###> Documentary;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.8 <###> Warmhearted and defiantly unsentimental, "Grandma, a Thousand Times" gains lightness from Teta's tart observations ... and the director's stylistic sprightliness.
771240312 <###> Grandma, a Thousand Times <###> Documentary;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> Director Mahmoud Kaabour is Fatima's grandson, and she instantly seizes on--lightly, in her way--the guilt and panic that's inspired him to make this film.

771256479 <###> A Letter to Momo <###> Drama;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> The hit-and-miss English dub flattens some of the dramatic beats, but this is still a rather lovely piece of work.
771256479 <###> A Letter to Momo <###> Drama;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> The new anime A Letter to Momo feels like the movie that Hayao Miyazaki's final film should have been.
771256479 <###> A Letter to Momo <###> Drama;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> A sweet, heartfelt, yet never maudlin story about an 11-year-old girl's coming to terms with the loss of her father.
771256479 <###> A Letter to Momo <###> Drama;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.25 <###> It's difficult to imagine any children's movie retaining the attention of its intended audience for two hours, but this movie feels especially monotonous.
771256479 <###> A Letter to Momo <###> Drama;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> Despite the hand-drawn film's supernatural edge, one of Okiura's lyrical strengths is acquainting a viewer with the poetry of the real - animated reflections of ordinary, beautiful things we see in everyday life without actually noticing them at all.
771256479 <###> A Letter to Momo <###> Drama;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.625 <###> A sweet tale of a sad girl who moves to a new place and meets supernatural pals.
771256479 <###> A Letter to Momo <###> Drama;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.625 <###> Had Okiura cut some of the supernatural shtick he would have had a far more affecting and mercifully shorter movie.
771256479 <###> A Letter to Momo <###> Drama;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> "A Letter to Momo" is unquestionably lovely to look at, but viewers may not be able to shake the feeling that they've seen much of it before, and done better.
771256479 <###> A Letter to Momo <###> Drama;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> Scene after gorgeously hand-drawn scene offer a visual feast, but two hours of it is a bit too long.
771256479 <###> A Letter to Momo <###> Drama;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.375 <###> A comic adventure that suffers from a dearth of both laughs and thrills.
771256479 <###> A Letter to Momo <###> Drama;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> A beautifully connected film on a spiritual level. Overall, Okiura stays very focused on Momo's emotional journey, which is smart.
771256479 <###> A Letter to Momo <###> Drama;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.625 <###> It offers a realistic portrayal of Momo's emotional state, but this comes at the expense of a deeper exploration into both the story's lush supernatural landscape and its inhabitants.
729738996 <###> Shortcut to Happiness (The Devil and Daniel Webster) <###> Drama;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Has to be seen to be believed -- a very rare case of a movie that's such an utter train wreck you can't stop watching.
729738996 <###> Shortcut to Happiness (The Devil and Daniel Webster) <###> Drama;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Much of the fault can be distributed to Hewitt's performance which has neither the zing nor the menace to effectively sell us that she has any credible advantage over heavyweights like Baldwin and Hopkins.
729738996 <###> Shortcut to Happiness (The Devil and Daniel Webster) <###> Drama;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Awkwardly paced, indifferently acted and laughably hokey.

770675369 <###> The Deadly Companions (Trigger Happy) <###> Western;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> As the deadlier of the refugee criminals, Steve Cochran is almost as mean as his colleague, Chill Wills, is picturesque. Their resourceful efforts would be more effective if the drama, as directed by Sam Peckinpah, did not move at the pace of a hearse.
770683664 <###> Night of the Juggler <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> A rough and gripping action-thriller about an ordinary man's desperate search to find his kidnapped little girl. Gritty with a capital G, and makes late '70 New York City seem like hell on earth.
770670258 <###> Morgan Stewart's Coming Home <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> even with the Alan Smithee label, Morgan Stewart's Coming Home isn't bad at all
770670258 <###> Morgan Stewart's Coming Home <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> All these years, I've kept a soft spot in my heart for it, in all its clumsy glory. Could I ever quite call it a good movie? Not really, not entirely.
770670251 <###> Animals Are Beautiful People <###> Documentary;Comedy;Special Interest <###> 0.7 <###> Often too cute for its own good, but overall such a pleasant change of pace from the usual documentary that it's a film worth seeing.
771385863 <###> Still The Enemy Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Director Owen Gower mixes plentiful archive footage with contemporary interviews to cut through the media rhetoric about rioting pickets and paint an altogether more alarming portrait of a carefully orchestrated state crackdown.
771385863 <###> Still The Enemy Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Packed with brilliant archive footage, Still The Enemy Within will send blood pressures rising again. But it doesn't really address ( ... ) why anyone today would still want to be working like a mole in such dangerous conditions.
771385863 <###> Still The Enemy Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> This is timely, important and truthful cinema, at once bitter, nostalgic and unexpectedly uplifting.
771385863 <###> Still The Enemy Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Should be compulsory viewing not only for school students learning about British history, but also for anyone who has even a remote interest in the relatively recent events that are still shaping this country today.
771385863 <###> Still The Enemy Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.7 <###> Like a companion piece to the feel-good drama Pride, his documentary was designed to explore the untold story of the 1984 British miners' strike.
771385863 <###> Still The Enemy Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> "History is written by the victors," said Winston Churchill famously, but Still The Enemy Within shows you can lose big and still emerge with a voice.
771385863 <###> Still The Enemy Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Gower's film is a heartfelt tribute to the communities who were hammered by political, not economic, forces. They look bloodied, but unbowed.

771385863 <###> Still The Enemy Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> The depth of focus and feeling in the miners' testimonials conveys a vivid picture of living through the strike, with Gower finding enough facets to sustain a stirring tribute to solidarity and a vital oral history of social protest.
771385863 <###> Still The Enemy Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> A thorough account of the 1984-5 UK miners' strike from those who were on the picket-lines.
771385863 <###> Still The Enemy Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> As the miners say, "We lost. But we were right." They were, and Still the Enemy Within elegantly and straightforwardly makes their case.

13052 <###> Memento <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Writer-director Christopher Nolan's second film is one of the most original and ultimately confounding mind games to reach the screen since The Usual Suspects.
13052 <###> Memento <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The three leads are excellent, but it's the masterful execution of an almost-too-clever-for-its-own-good concept which really makes this the most delicious kind of food for the mind.
13052 <###> Memento <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> The mystery requires a lot of concentration, but the stunning final scene is ample reward. Not just an indulgence, the ingenious structure makes the point that memory, although unreliable, is what we depend upon for our sense of reality.
13052 <###> Memento <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> This is the kind of movie that gas-bag instructors use to illustrate the concept that one man's reality is another's fiction. But it's puny stuff compared to Kurosawa's Rashomon.
13052 <###> Memento <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Occasionally the film trips over its own complexity, but it's tense, devious and evokes Leonard's disorientation quite brilliantly. Operation of heavy machinery after watching is a definite no-no.

13052 <###> Memento <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> More than an enigmatic, jittery, occasionally funny treatise on vengeance's fruitlessness, "Memento" never abandons an emotional quandary: How can a man unable to feel time expect to heal? Leonard loses himself, as we all do, in habit and repetition.
13052 <###> Memento <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.92 <###> Nolan's sophomore effort is a near peerless psychological thriller.
13052 <###> Memento <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Writer-director Christopher Nolan toys with our minds as each scene ends where the previous scene began in a sort of tidal regression and progression of story and character.

771372055 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Wirkola finds room for at least one good sight gag (a zombie commandant becomes frustrated when he is unable to return a 'Sieg heil!' salute due to his chopped-off right arm) before he succumbs to the hee-haw bloodbath of the battle royale finale.
771372055 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Some people will never find a movie containing this quantity of blood and intestines funny. If you are not one of those people, prepare to crack up.
771372055 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.65 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead could have been a lazy movie, but writer/director Tommy Wirkola is too keen let his imagination run wild.
771372055 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red vs Dead is even bloodier and more excessive than the first film, but that's what makes it so entertaining. This is without a doubt one of the most preposterously bonkers and genre-pleasing zombie sequels ever made.
771372055 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The makers of "Dead Snow 2" rely heavily on the inherent absurdity of their film's premise, and expect you to do the rest.
771372055 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Dead Snow 2 has its share of fun, goofy, gory moments...Half the budget must have gone for fake intestines.
771372055 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Unabashed homage to Evil Dead 2 and movies like it. Sounds pretty awesome to me.
771372055 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> By formally acknowledging the material's inherent silliness ad nauseam, the filmmakers have distanced themselves from the spirit of the parody, robbing it of its gruesome pleasures.
771372055 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.72 <###> When it's funny, it's laugh-out-loud hilarious. So while the film has weaknesses, it's nevertheless a sequel that actually improves on the original.
771372055 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> At the end of the day, this might be the closest we ever get to a fourth Evil Dead film. Groovy.
771372055 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Dead Snow 2: Red Vs. Dead is a superbly confident splatterfest that could be some of the most fun you'll have at the movies this year. Ein! Zwei! Die...AGAIN!

680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> I can't comment on whether it does Narnia literature justice, but as a film fan, I can whole-heartedly recommend it as an example of fantasy done right.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> It's a relatively entertaining romp, but it would be surprising if anyone is counting down the days until the third movie.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Adamson seems to have decided the great battle at the end of the previous film was its best part and has set out to recapture it but more so, leading to some truly outstanding set pieces, but resulting in a film that is less than the sum of its parts.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Some religious punters may find it to be a bastardization of their and Lewis' theological core values, while secularists will find the whole Narnia concept to be nothing more than a shrewd recruiting campaign for Christianity.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Darker, more complex and less prone to the cutesy wow-factor, this is a gripping tale with a thoughtful message.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> The body count is high, the running time is particularly long for a children's film, and the themes are fairly heavy. But, like Wardrobe, it's a lush and mostly entertaining production.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Most of C.S. Lewis's peculiar magic is lost.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The creakiness of the plot mechanics and the light condescension I detect don't have me looking forward to the third Narnia movie.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> ...the opening hour essentially proceeds at a crawl...
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.69 <###> It's unfair to characterize it as Lord of the Rings-Light, but it's difficult to avoid that conclusion after watching this earnest but seriously under-inspired effort.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> It's entertaining, value-for-money stuff.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> As with any would-be summer blockbuster, the members of the special effects team are the real stars, and they haven't stinted in bringing this fantasy world to life.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Adamson's pulled a more morally nuanced rabbit (or badger, actually) out of his directorial hat this time out, and the result is a far more engrossing film than its predecessor.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> It's characters like these that make the film worth seeing, but if the Narnia series continues to get worse with each installment, Disney would be better off just finishing the trilogy and calling it quits.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> A well-executed, faithful version of the C. S. Lewis classic.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> The acting, direction and effects have all improved considerably since The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe and Narnia fans won't be disappointed, but the story itself is weak by comparison.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Prince Caspian (the movie) is gorgeous and a total snore. The boy is just gorgeous. Whitewashing the themes also removed the story.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> An improvement over the original, Prince Caspian better catches the nuances of the source material, but continues to ignore some of the more potent statements.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Significantly better than the first film or, say, the first two Harry Potters.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Marred by the dull performance of the movie's pinup-ready title swashbuckler and the relative charmlessness of the English schoolchildren (the Hogwarts Sorting Hat would have kicked these kids to the curb).
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> This film is a more of an action flick than the first, but there is still enough of the magic of Narnia to ensure the success of the franchise will continue.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Its darker tone and well turned performances lend credibility and urgency to the story, but the forced Disney/Walden-style kiddie pandering makes for a rather schizophrenic experience.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> "In the two battle scenes, we always have an exact sense of what an old film professor of mine called the "axis of action." We know who is where, and why, and where things stand
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Prince Caspian is rife with Christian metaphors and mythology. Well, they're there if you choose to see them.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> Adamson is probably indifferent to politics, which would be easier to forgive if the film gave you anything else to think about.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> All in all, a solid and respectable entry to the ledger.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> This is a dark romantic epic, which at times recalls such classic sagas as Ivanhoe and Quentin Durward, and it's very enjoyable on a number of levels, not least in the realm of pure spectacle.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Prince Caspian has most of the elements required for a fantasy-action-adventure story, and the book has been intelligently adapted for the screen.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> I really wanted to like this movie, and Andrew Adamson has made a polished looking film, but I had a tough time getting into it.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Character depth and stirring subtext is what books are for. Adamson's Narnia adaptations remove all that pesky claptrap so that we can glide through a superficial reading.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Um dos pontos fracos do longa original, resultado de um grave erro de julgamento dos produtores, mostra-se intocavel nesta continuacao: a falta de carisma do elenco principal.

680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> This sorry sequel is so boring, so unimaginative, and so blandly by-the-numbers that it's almost like [an affront] to the very audience members who made the original a worldwide hit.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Ben Barnes looks lost, with a thick Mediterranean accent reminiscent of Mandy Patinkin's avenging Spaniard from The Princess Bride: 'My name is Inigo Montoya--you killed my father--prepare to die!'
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> It lacks the kind of rich details and memorable dialogue that would elevate it to amazing status, but the action is good

680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> As a fantasy action movie, there's enough about Prince Caspian that works to make it an enjoyable rather than punishing experience.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Prince Caspian sounds like he is channeling Walter Koenig, better known as Ensign Chekov on "Star Trek."
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Instead of following the same formula of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," Adamson has created an entirely different Narnia, one that is darker and full of hatred and violence.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> ...bland family fare with high end production values. It feels about as real as a Disneyland ride, and what a fantasy film needs to do is convince you of is that even the most fanciful thing in its imagined universe is absolutely real.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The movie has just enough of that old-timey grand epic feel for its 144 minutes to breeze by like two and a quarter hours.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> This movie just can't put it all together. I'm blaming it squarely on the storytelling.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Surprisingly good filmmaking, but a kid's film? Could it be that any important lessons here get lost in all the warring?
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> With the main cast and the voice of Liam Neesam as the voice of Aslan back, as well as the creatures and CGI effects, there's enough adventures and suspense for the entire family to enjoy.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> It's more or less what the first movie should have been: a (mostly) captivating epic.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> A praiseworthy sequel aided immeasurably by the continuity and chemistry of the return of all the principal cast members, and above all by the sort of special effects spectacles the tykes are likely to want to see again and again.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> [T]here's a not-so-subtle undercurrent of the White Man's Burden in these stories.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> In steering the film closer to his own vision, director Adamson steers it away from C.S. Lewis's, and so it loses some of the book's core spiritual themes.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8125 <###> Puss in Boots, Gimli and Jesus Christ walk into a bar. The bartender, noticing how down they all look, asks what's wrong...
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Thrilling action combined with a big step up in the cast's performances make The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian a fun, if unequal sequel.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Up against other summer blockbusters and practically going head to head with Indian Jones, Chronicles of Narnia fans will not be disappointed in this rousing fantasy.

680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> Is there nothing Peter Dinklage cannot do%u2026and do it well?
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> Prince Caspian is any indication, there is the potential for greatness should the remaining chapters follow it to the screen.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian dials down the spirituality but cranks the level of action to 11.

680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> A fantasy film without much magic but plenty of darkness and violence.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> The decision to go 'PG' issued a renewed faith that Hollywood can spit out a money-generating product without having to spew gallons of blood and blow stuff up. But that didn't come without great scrutiny and much editing.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Chockablock with intense battle sequences and suffused with a sense of paradise lost, Prince Caspian is a worthy successor to The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> At least we're already acquainted with the kids, so we know their story, but Caspian, loosely based on C.S. Lewis' novel, misses the opportunity to deepen it.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> If you ever wondered what The Lord of the Rings would have been like had Disney made it on the cheap, tossing the cast of Hannah Montana into Middle Earth, here it is. Caspian is two hours and 20 minutes of 'Whatever'.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> What's important here is that Narnia -- and its fascinating all-ages mix of pagan myth and Christian symbolism, of boy's-own-adventures and Round Table heroics -- is back.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Another classic saga of deeds dastardly and swashes buckled, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian doesn't quite equal the first film, but some may find this one a less-insistent piece of pure entertainment because it isn't so overtly Christian.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Sure, it's a big-budget spectacle. But it's also the kind of grandly old-fashioned entertainment we don't get enough of anymore.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Prince Caspian has pretty much something for everyone built into it. Little of it may be exceptional, but much of it goes beyond the usual PG standard in thoughtfulness and craftsmanship as well as carnage.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian represents a moody, action-packed flashpoint in the arc of Narnia.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> The struggles remain, but [director] Adamson has tweaked the plot, rejiggered the character dynamics and piled on the epic warfare. By the end I had overdosed on surly Peter, pouty Caspian and over-digitized shock-and-awe.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Something human is missing here, amidst all the centaurs and talking bears and mobile trees. It's the art of storytelling, which knows when to allow characters time for heartfelt interaction, when to build suspense, when to mount a climax.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> On whole, this fantasy adventure does feature more action and is more exciting, arguably, than its predecessor, the 2005 film adaptation of C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia book, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> Like the finest fantasy epics, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian invites us into a rich realm and, at two-plus hours, holds us there for a goodly spell.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> With bigger battles and scarier monsters than its predecessor, the new movie flaunts grander visual effects, and, with one notable exception, a dash more individuality than the initial installment.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> The magical creatures and sprawling battles have been beautifully produced and shot, and the thunderous final conflict shakes the Earth.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> A muscular fantasy epic that marks a filmmaking improvement if not a leap in dramatic inspiration over 2005's The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, Caspian reveals this series as conceived ever more clearly as a junior-league Lord of the Rings.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> If you and your children enjoyed your first visit to Narnia, you'll be satisfied by the second trip.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Much of what makes the first Narnia movie work is, literally, missing in action in the spiritless sequel.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Entertaining, but doesn't have the depth and daring of the best fantasy movies.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> Adamson has done such a brilliant job of pacing that there is no point in the movie where you can leave for a break...If you do, you will undoubtedly miss something.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> It's like the Little Golden Book version of "Gladiator," a mostly bloodless but mostly barbaric PG film with R-rated aspirations. Worse yet, it's even more wearisome than its predecessor - drained of magic or emotion by a plodding pace.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Why oh why are these sequels always bigger and louder and longer and bad?
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> It's basically a war, with arguing, strategy sessions and long, boring battle sequences, and very little in the way of character development, humor or joy.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> This darker, edgier feel ultimately benefits the film, although I feel the price that the flick pays is a loss of the wide-eyed, magical feel that its predecessor so tenderly possessed.
680139028 <###> The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Adamson is willing to jettison Lewis' "quaint" (I'd say loveable) whimsy and mythical acumen in favor of more martial sequences that'll sucker in the Lord of the Rings crowd.

12870 <###> Closer <###> Drama <###> 0.74 <###> Closer is no joke and it's got the brave, mature performances of an all-star cast to prove it. It's a movie in which characters feel each other up with their hands and knock each other down with words.

12870 <###> Closer <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The film is pitched with the same pace and distance as the play; characters chatter on in neat, clipped little sound bites that sound very little like real conversation.
12870 <###> Closer <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> It's ugly, but true. Closer is like the 'smoker's lung' billboard. But instead of showing diseased lungs, it exposes hearts ruined by lies, pride, and jealousy.

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The animation is perfectly colorful and the voice actors earn their paychecks, but it's blatantly obvious that this thing started production without a screenplay -- and hit the screens without a plot.

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Strictly for kids, and, as the three or four people who saw Oedekerk's previous directing effort, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist, can attest, the writer/director tends to stretch even throwaway jokes minutes past the punch line.
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Ben the Cow (the voice of Sam Elliott) has to teach his carefree son Otis (Kevin James) the responsibility of leadership over the farm animals.

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> Not good enough for even a rental, this 'Barnyard' should be burned for fear of mad cow disease
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Barnyard doesn't know if it wants to be another tiresomely 'hip' piece of post-Shrek postmodernism or a comfortably traditional kids' movie that delivers family values without the self-conscious smirk.
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Could cause more gender confusion than 'Transamerica.'
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> All the cows have udders - even the male ones. In real life, only female cows have udders. What kind of sick, alternate cow universe does this movie take place in anyway?

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> With shamefully obvious nods to the father/son sentimentality of traditional Disney 'toons and even an awkward love interest, Barnyard is a mishmash of modern cartoon cliches.

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The CG animation looks like rubbery plastic instead of animals, and much of it is spent on jokes related to derrieres and hindquarters.

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Could qualify as a case study in just how quickly and thoroughly computer-animated studio releases have declined to a state of inspiration-depleted, assembly-line anthropomorphism.
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> A sweet and mildly funny movie that will entertain young audiences, but one aspect is utterly mystifying: The two main characters, father and son bovine creatures, have large, distracting udders.
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> This is a darn cute movie and I think you'll find it funny.

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Politically correct, anatomically incorrect and ugly to look at, the only thing that saves Barnyard is writer (and director) Steve Oedekerk's gift for gags and almost-edgy humor.

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> If you want to punish your kids, send them to bed without dinner. If you want to disturb, frighten and depress them while making sure they fail biology, take them to the animated feature Barnyard.
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Too mature for little kids and much too corny for older siblings and chaperones, Barnyard probably should have been put out to pasture long before it made it to the multiplex.
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Maybe if the plot was more engaging I wouldn't have been so distracted, but Barnyard was pretty disappointing.

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Colorful and energetically silly, a little scary and shot through with reassuring and worthy life lessons, it's an untaxing children's movie formula all the way.

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Adults will get enough laughs to survive gags such as the chickens using a Col. Sanders dartboard but will likely lose patience waiting for the very predictable story and sentiments to slowly play themselves out.
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Barnyard moves with a frenetic energy, especially in the numerous barn dance and chase scenes, that will probably keep family audiences moderately entertained.

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The basically good -- though not very inspired -- Barnyard just stirred up a lot of 'been there, done that' feelings in me as I watched this film.
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Barnyard: The Original Party Animals actually has a clever concept (the animals walk upright and hang out like humans when the farmer isn't looking) and it handles such sensitive topics as birth and death with unexpected grace.
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Barnyard is nothing so much as The Lion King chewed in a cud and digitally regurgitated. It's manic and maudlin, borderline creepy, occasionally inspired.

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> This is the most dubious animation since Robert Zemeckis's creepy The Polar Express, only uglier, lazier, and with a more indisputable racist streak.
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The barnyard is the Middle East; the hens represent the oil wealth; and the humans are the ineffectual United Nations! Or... perhaps it's all just a mediocre cartoon about talking barnyard animals. Whichever.
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Moooove along, there's nothing to see here! With its blatant disregard for the laws of nature, gravity and good humor, this animated adventure is little more than a series of gags... loosely strung to the plot of The Lion King.
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> This often amusing but also aimless and forgettable animated comedy is noteworthy mostly for its random musical numbers and surprising amounts of violence.

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Barnyard isn't genius, but it isn't cloying either. It's aggressively entertaining and, at times, unexpectedly touching.

190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Barnyard can at least hold its head up as a sharply scripted effort that, while assembled from familiar elements, does not feel focus-grouped and committeed to death.
190816315 <###> Barnyard <###> Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> If the humor is smart and effective, the animation is lackluster and uneven -- the pixel pushers at Pixar have spoiled us.

771380509 <###> Timbuktu <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Avoiding stereotypes, the movie shrinks larger political and religious battles down to the people of a desert town - city dwellers and nomadic Tuareg people out in the dunes - being forced to change by a handful of halfhearted oppressors.
771380509 <###> Timbuktu <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> It manages to ravish the heart while dazzling the eye simultaneously, neither at the expense of the other. It's a work of art that seems realized in an entirely organic way.

771380509 <###> Timbuktu <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> The film's criticism isn't primarily rooted in satire, but rather in fury and condemnation for those who seek to be gods while shamefully feigning to follow and praise one god.
771380509 <###> Timbuktu <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Timbuktu is frightening and frustrating viewing. You're watching the noose tighten over an entire town, and at times, it will cause you to gasp.
771380509 <###> Timbuktu <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Sissako may be preaching to the converted here, but he does so with elegance, intelligence and beauty.
771388076 <###> The Lesson <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The talented Margita Gosheva grippingly plays an assertive, hardworking, honest heroine, but that's all she'll do here. Following her static, white-knuckled strain is compelling but not exactly a delight.

770683985 <###> Tarzan and His Mate <###> Classics;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> The most interesting aspect of this Tarzan installment is its adult appeal: Weissmuller and O'Sullivan's Tarzan and Jane are obviously living in sexual freedom as they swing through the trees.

770683985 <###> Tarzan and His Mate <###> Classics;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> Perhaps the best Tarzan film of them all, with Weismjuller and O'Sullivan in grand jungle form.

771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.1 <###> People with brains they can't turn on and off for 90 minute stretches of holiday family togetherness will be driven to take some kind of painkiller before the final credits roll. Everyone else will be fine
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> If 'Parental Guidance' is the drivel that's passing for family fare this winter, then it's best to just keep your family warm and entertained at home.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> I don't know if it's reassuring or scary that in such an American film the kids seems to be UK-style victims of both health and safety rules and political correctness at the same time.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Poor Crystal. There remains a scintilla of dignity in his sad clown. He may beatbox while wearing wraparound sunglasses, but, thankfully for you and yours, he does not dance the robot.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The underlying issues make for a surprisingly relevant film.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> A yappy pile-up of grandparents-know-best shtick, gross-out bathroom humor and sentimental claptrap.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Crystal, Midler and Tomei make a perfect combination for this funny but heartwarming family film
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Just as ghastly as it sounds.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> One of those intergenerational embarrassment comedies in the Meet the Fockers line, where children can enjoy seeing grown-ups looking ridiculous.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The family friendliest movie comedy this holiday season is also the sappiest and schmaltziest. And thanks to Billy Crystal, the shtickiest.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A film with little else to commend it from the obvious.

771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Midler does her best as a put-upon grandma but, ultimately, Parental Guidance feels dated.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Warm and schmaltzy, Parental Guidance is the movie equivalent of comfort food. It's funny and warmhearted, not terribly ambitious, but it does the things it sets out to do well.

771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> However, most of the conflicts aren't really ever fleshed out, and the movie dedicates just as much energy to Crystal getting hit in the groin with a bat as it does to satisfactorily resolving much of anything.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> ...this flick is so desperate to be hip that it ultimately feels as relevant as "Mr. Belvedere"... If you have to ask what that is, then you probably won't enjoy this movie.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> The Baby Boomer teaming no one was asking for&mdash;Billy Crystal and Bette Midler&mdash;melded to that most moribund of genres, rugrats "comedy"...
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> It's not much fun to watch the perennial Oscar host take a baseball bat to the groin or vomit on a child, let alone in the same scene.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Billy Crystal delivers nostalgic, heartwarming fun for young children, parents and grandparents.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Face it Billy, this isn't that funny.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Surprisingly enjoyable family comedy, enlivened by likeable comic performances and a handful of decent gags ...
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> a sloppy concretion inadvertently showcasing pretty much everything that can be done wrong in filmmaking short of forgetting to remove the lens cap. Though in this case, that last might actually have been an improvement
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> It's hard to say what's worse: the sneering disdain for modern child-rearing tactics or the hacky generation-clash humor.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> It's hard to know who exactly "Parental Guidance" was made for.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's a shame they didn't choose a stronger project than Andy Fickman's family comedy, but you could certainly ask for worse babysitters.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Parental Guidance feels like it's been thoughtlessly written in a boardroom strictly as a vehicle for Crystal to perform the same past-due routines he does at the Oscars, musical numbers and all.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Thanks to Crystal and Midler playing comfortable versions of the personas we've come to know, it's actually better than you would guess.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Does it work? You betcha. There are smiles and tears, love and affirmations, a few funny jokes and a lot of easy sentimentality.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Deeply, willfully out of touch ...
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Despite a talented cast, the film's promising premise - old-school parenting vs. new-school kids - is mishandled.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> From a bounty of low, low moments in "Parental Guidance," it's difficult to choose the absolute lowest.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Director Andy Fickman opts against subtlety at every turn. A score filled with heavy strings and the occasional ringing of chimes telegraphs all emotional cues, practically willing the water out of your tear ducts.

771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Billy Crystal and Bette Midler class it up as much as they can. It's just such a shame "Parental Guidance" is otherwise so darn dumb.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> This '90s-type family comedy falls into the same traps as most second-tier sitcoms, with eccentric characters and snappy zingers spouted as if cue cards were hovering at the edge of the frame.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.15 <###> Protests the entitlement of children by shamelessly promoting the entitlement of condescending grandparents.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> I suspect "Parental Guidance" would have seemed funnier if it had come out 25 years ago.

771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> Offers a confused and flat portrayal of generational differences.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> 'Parental Guidance' is a cinematic hemorrhoid throbbing on the screen, its only purpose in life to cause pain and discomfort.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> Rather than fun for the whole family, Parental Guidance is more like a hole for the fun family--a shrill, depressing pit where laughs and joy do not exist.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Parental Guidance should be rated X - suitable for no one.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Unfortunately, Andy Fickman's fussy family saga fails the funny test, despite a few random highlights.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> While its senior stars do a terrific job capturing aging in a youth-crazed culture, Guidance drops the ball, in all departments, in its portrayal of anyone younger than 55.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Apparently there comes a point in every comic's life when, after living on the edge for so long, they reach for the pipe and slippers and start doing toothless family comedies.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> The latest in a long run of 2012 films to confront the indignities of ageing, this one is arguably, if not intentionally, the most harrowing.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> A wincingly unfunny family comedy that puts Crystal's overbearing shtick front and center.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Thanks to a wonderful cast and Crystal's good intentions, Parental Guidance is a much better movie than one might expect it to be.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It is with deep regret that the last film I review for 2012 be Andy Fickman's Parental Guidance, wherein Billy Crystal is struck in the testicles with a baseball bat, and then proceeds to vomit on a child out of agony.
771257655 <###> Parental Guidance <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It's not quite funny enough and I could have done without the lavatory humour, but it's so warm and fuzzy that it's hard to dislike.

11287 <###> Undercover Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> 'Undercover Brother' comes packed with possibilities, but can't keep its groove thing shaking with enough consistency to be any more than a 'Saturday Night Live' sketch that goes on too long.
11287 <###> Undercover Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game, this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness.

11287 <###> Undercover Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The one-liners are clever enough and the physical comedy and pop-culture goofing sufficiently dumb and broad to make Undercover Brother ... a reasonably pleasant experience.
11287 <###> Undercover Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Displays the disarming nutball sensibility of a Naked Gun farce and the dead-on social satire of an on-its-game Saturday Night Live sketch.

11287 <###> Undercover Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Quite like the first Austin Powers in that it's pretty funny, but it could have been funnier if they'd invented more loopy spins on the basic premise.
11287 <###> Undercover Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> First-time feature director Malcolm D. Lee doesn't have a feel for the material, blows one sure-thing bit after another and fails to let, or make his cast be funny.
11287 <###> Undercover Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Sadly, contains too little of the fashion or the funk that made its predecessors so much fun.
11287 <###> Undercover Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> There are laughs aplenty, and, as a bonus, viewers don't have to worry about being subjected to farts, urine, feces, semen, or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies.

11287 <###> Undercover Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A witty piece of genre deconstruction that's curiously drunk on pomo knowingness for both the mofo mystique of 70s blaxploitation and the mojo bull**** of James Bond.
771412133 <###> Dope <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Like an urban Risky Business. I gotta say it - DOPE is dope!
771412133 <###> Dope <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> It's about kids who we're generally not asked to care about: a cast almost entirely made up of actors of colour.
771412133 <###> Dope <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> A fast-paced throwback that is a little like a mix of House Party and Boyz n the Hood
13532 <###> The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.625 <###> Jovovich brings an intensity to the role well-matched to Besson's stylistic energy, though this comic-bookish take on Jeanne D'Arc won't be winning any historical-society awards. [Blu-ray]
13532 <###> The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.68 <###> Impressive to look at, but in the end, it just doesn't ring true.
13532 <###> The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.2 <###> Girlfriend was a few fries short of a happy meal.
13532 <###> The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.4 <###> I know less about Joan of Arc now than I did going into the film.
13532 <###> The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.25 <###> Both visually spectacular and staggeringly awful.
13532 <###> The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.375 <###> Among the laughably bad lines is one uttered by The Conscience. 'When does the pain end and the pleasure begin?' he asks Joan. For The Messenger's audience, it is as soon as the ending credits begin to roll.
13532 <###> The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.2 <###> Simply horrible.
13532 <###> The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> I can only conclude that Milla Jovovich's woefully unconvincing performance as the title character was a prominent reason for Luc Besson's split with her.
13532 <###> The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> An intelligent film with intelligent ideas.
13532 <###> The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> Does not have the grandeur, the poetry, the range of Lawrence of Arabia but makes up for its shortcomings by being eminently user-friendly.
13532 <###> The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Besson is unable to weave the comic scenes together with the serious gory ones, so both seem increasingly jarring and unbelievable.
13532 <###> The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> I guess they're going to keep telling the story of Joan of Arc until they get it right.
13532 <###> The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.625 <###> A great movie that doesn't know when to quit
13536 <###> 100 Girls <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> ...you could certainly do worse.
13536 <###> 100 Girls <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Far from the teen movies of yesteryear, but has it's fair share of youngster fun
13536 <###> 100 Girls <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.71 <###> As insightful as teen romances come, 100 Girls is an examination of one guy's search for the perfect girl.
13536 <###> 100 Girls <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> One hell of an oddity
98821883 <###> The Big Doll House <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> A first-person lament, the title song establishes that the story will be told sympathetically from the point of view of the female inmates, even if their humiliation and suffering (and their communal showers) are the film's raison d'etre.
98821883 <###> The Big Doll House <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> When the skin factor is low, Sid Haig saves the show! Sure, overall it's a piece of crap, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a piece of crap film finer than this one.
98821883 <###> The Big Doll House <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> A great, glorious trash classic.
771352519 <###> Ip Man: The Final Fight <###> Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> It's admirable that Ip Man: The Final Fight takes a different approach to the character than the other Ip Man films out there, but it lacks the excitement that made Ip Man and Ip Man 2 so entertaining.
771352519 <###> Ip Man: The Final Fight <###> Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> More a frequently elegant drama than an outright action movie.
771352519 <###> Ip Man: The Final Fight <###> Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> This is a rare case where, if a film had been livelier and less traditional and "respectful," its lead performance might have seemed less special.
771352519 <###> Ip Man: The Final Fight <###> Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Seriously, if not always elegantly, the film portrays the great Ip Man as someone trying to survive, which is to say just as often a victim as a victor.
771352519 <###> Ip Man: The Final Fight <###> Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Soap opera, set-bound and unexceptionally written and directed.
771352519 <###> Ip Man: The Final Fight <###> Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> The naturalism of Wong's performance is undercut ... by Yau's use of phony-looking sets, sterile CGI and flashy aerial shots.
771352519 <###> Ip Man: The Final Fight <###> Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> The overall sense is of a rushed, simplistic installment in a well-worn biography franchise.
771352519 <###> Ip Man: The Final Fight <###> Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> In The Final Fight, the frequent full-combat interludes work against the truth-vs.-fiction themes of the rest of the film.
19560 <###> Gray's Anatomy <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It is haunting, though. How could it not be, when the last lines of the monolog are "Ecstasy, despair, ecstasy, despair" and some mention of a big fish?
19560 <###> Gray's Anatomy <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Soderbergh does (Gray) no favors with a series of overwrought stylistic choices.
19560 <###> Gray's Anatomy <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The late Spalding Gray's monologue is typically fascinating, and Soderbergh's creative staging is a treat.
19560 <###> Gray's Anatomy <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> A chatty, colorful, nicely sardonic account of how a crisis led Mr. Gray to assess his medical state, consider his mortality and take one more funny, self-dramatizing look at the eccentric world around him.
19560 <###> Gray's Anatomy <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> At best, Gray is a tragicomic Everyman who strikes an empathic chord in his admiring audience; at worst, he's a middle-aged, self-absorbed, hopelessly provincial New Yorker -- an urban hick who won't shut up.
19560 <###> Gray's Anatomy <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The film manages to come off like a dinnertime conversation with a friend -- albeit a one-sided and long but very good and very funny one.
19560 <###> Gray's Anatomy <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Soderbergh is a gifted director (SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE; KING OF THE HILL); Gray is a gifted monologist (SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA). They're just not a very good match for the creation of a film.
19560 <###> Gray's Anatomy <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The movie version of Gray's material seems arch, contrived and starchy, not the spontaneous eruption that his theater work manages to resemble.
19560 <###> Gray's Anatomy <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There's something intrinsically insincere about the whole quest. Gray is on a search less for a cure than for material.
19560 <###> Gray's Anatomy <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> If you cannot see Spalding Gray live, then do see his monologue films. Gray's Anatomy can be infuriating, but Spalding makes it worthwhile.
19560 <###> Gray's Anatomy <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Not only is it interesting to follow the course of Gray's storyline, the movie is also equally interesting to view, even if the storyteller is just sitting in front of a desk most of the time.
19560 <###> Gray's Anatomy <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> In spite of Soderbergh and the painful lack of an audience/laugh track, Gray's story is immediately compelling, proving that once again, a talking head can truly entertain an audience.
16393 <###> How to Get Ahead in Advertising <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Grant alone makes this eminently worth renting.
16393 <###> How to Get Ahead in Advertising <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Thanks to Grant's bravura performance, the film is wickedly enjoyable.
16393 <###> How to Get Ahead in Advertising <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> One of the strangest, most outrageous, most bitter, irreverent and bitingly funny satires the movies ever offered.
16393 <###> How to Get Ahead in Advertising <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> trippy
16393 <###> How to Get Ahead in Advertising <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> acerbic but overstated satire
770711833 <###> One More Round <###> Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> An unsuccessful concoction of sincerity, camp and crassness that is more interested in its parade of D-level celebrities than developing its characters.
19563 <###> Ulysses <###> Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> A cheesy, but entertaining excursion into mythology, Douglas a bit hammy and Anthony Quinn chews on some fat as well. A guilty pleasure.
16397 <###> Razor Blade Smile <###> Horror;Art House & International;Cult Movies <###> 0.625 <###> West's cleverness gets the better of him in the final minutes, tacking on an arbitrary twist that, quite simply, trashes the trashy enjoyment of all that preceded.
770674775 <###> The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.65 <###> A sharper eye on developing the themes and characters might have produced a compelling character drama but The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 is a good bit better than average. There aren't many sequels that can say that.
770674775 <###> The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Very much a loyal sequel to its predecessor, essentially showing that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
770674775 <###> The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Traveling Pants 2 offers more of the same and, I'm afraid, more of the same and more of the same.
770674775 <###> The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Most sequels are worse than the originals. A few are better. Here's one that is exactly as good as the one that inspired it, and that's enough for me.
770674775 <###> The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> These Pants are torn and frayed.
770674775 <###> The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> This movie is definitely not as good as the first as it seemed to lack showing the bonding moments that made these girls true friends.
770674775 <###> The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> what was fresh in the original is stale in the sequel
770674775 <###> The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Teenage girls (and women getting in touch with their inner teenager) will have a fine time...

770674775 <###> The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Sisterhood furthers an honest dialogue among young women, for whom life roads are not always clearly paved. It's definitely not The Baby-Sitters Club -- and that's a good thing.
770674775 <###> The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Hamri's film barely incorporates the pants into any of its primary storylines, so busy is it struggling to keep track of the many peripheral characters and subplots which crop up around each corner.

771369738 <###> Une nouvelle amie (The New Girlfriend) <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> A bit of a dull jumble.
771369738 <###> Une nouvelle amie (The New Girlfriend) <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Breezy and brash ... All of the lead, and appealing, characters run riot on the Kinsey scale of sexuality.

13282 <###> Hellraiser: Deader <###> Horror <###> 0.6 <###> The new Hellraiser films aren't perfect, but at least they're not totally decimating a beloved franchise as the new Crow films are.
13282 <###> Hellraiser: Deader <###> Horror <###> 0.25 <###> You know you're in trouble when the word you use to augment your franchise moniker is a semi-creepy, made-up word (why not "Hellraiser: Spookeegery").
13282 <###> Hellraiser: Deader <###> Horror <###> 0.25 <###> ...unpleasant, interminable...
13282 <###> Hellraiser: Deader <###> Horror <###> 0.4 <###> The film is rated R for violence, gore, drugs, nudity, and simulated sex. You'd have thought the filmmakers could have found something in there of interest to a viewer.

13282 <###> Hellraiser: Deader <###> Horror <###> 0.4 <###> The Hellraiser-ish material is just kind of wedged in here and there with little sense, rhythm, or excitement.
770971855 <###> Vampires: The Turning <###> Horror <###> 0.125 <###> Astoundingly awful on so many levels...
770971855 <###> Vampires: The Turning <###> Horror <###> 0.3 <###> If there's one saving grace to Vampires: The Turning (and really, there isn't; I'm just trying to be a nice guy), it might be the small handful of action scenes. Might.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> I felt a level of exasperation with how the character of Joe handled his own children. I'm not a fan of men who have a problem stepping up to the role of a parent.

770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Owen reveals a rarely glimpsed warmth and the father and son dynamic has charm, but sappiness keeps the film nice, rather than as good as it might have been.

770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> If you could order a heart-tugging movie about a widower single dad from the Boden catalogue, accessorised with emotional moments purchased online at johnlewis.com, it might look like this excruciatingly artificial and prettified film.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Hicks's hand with these relationships is more than sure enough to guide this unexpectedly observant movie over its occasional rough spots.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The Boys Are Back strains admirably against the stereotypes which tend to weigh down such tales of the expected.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> A quintessential boys film to admire with no explosions or pixelated action sequences.

770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Visually sharp but dramatically flat, The Boys Are Back plays like a montage of Kodak moments that engage the eye but rarely the heart.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Often touching, more often infuriating account of an ex-pat Brit journo in Oz exploring the how-to of father-son bonding. But even if you're grinding your teeth, the film's brash exuberance and its lead actor will keep you watching.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The quality of the acting is impressive and serves to at least give some substance to a rather flimsy plot.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> The plot is mundane and relatively dull... The result is an experience that's amiable but underwhelming.

770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> While Scott Hicks' film is worth a watch, it just skims the surface of the single dad issues it tackles and by the end is a bit too Happy Families.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The film is a convincing portrait of the stress of single parenthood. Owen does well in a tricky role. I could watch him all day, and after The Boys Are Back, I felt like I had.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.2 <###> Owen's voiceover is a cringeworthy accompaniment on the film's heavily signposted road to redemptive hugs and Joe's tentative romance with a divorcee.

770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> This story is rather un-cinematic, lacking a driving narrative. But it's a telling exploration of relationships, relying on a superb cast to keep us engaged.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> What follows is a string of reasonably interesting ups and downs, with no clear overall plot to thread them together. It's kind of pretty good, ish.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Clive Owen gets a decent showcase for his more sensitive side in this otherwise middling drama.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> [Clive Owen] puts in one of the best performances of his career in a heartfelt emotional drama.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> [Clive Owen's] performance as Joe in The Boys Are Back not only gives the film a strong emotional centre but also keeps it out of overly sentimental territory.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> This family's period of adjustment may tug on the heart a bit but fails, save for Owen's holding power, to form a dramatic grip out of all that sympathy.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> The Boys are Back deftly combines humour and heart in a well crafted tale of boys of all ages growing up, and if it helps, just think of it as a good film they happened to make in Australia.

770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The film plods along unremarkably -- even Joe's unorthodox rearing techniques lose their surprise factor after a while -- but does remain true to itself right to the bitter(sweet) end.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> There's a lot to like about the film. Hicks makes evocative use of the Fleurieu Peninsula's hills and coastline to impart some magic to Joe's attempts to turn life with his sons in to a Boys' Own adventure.
770807582 <###> The Boys Are Back <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Scott Hicks's return to the big-screen -- and Australia, courtesy of the film's South Australian setting -- is a wonderfully moving meditation on life, death and familial bonds that triumphs in its understated approach.

771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Wes Ball's film version of the popular young-adult novel by James Dashner never makes much sense. Perhaps it would make more if you have read the book, but until they start handing out free copies before the movie starts, that cannot be a requirement.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The writers seem to have been reared in the "Lost" school of storytelling, happy to pile on three more questions for every answer.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> A sci-fi thriller set in a vaguely post-apocalyptic future must create a fully drawn universe to thoroughly captivate the viewer. But Maze Runner feels only partially formed.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> What's intriguing about "The Maze Runner"-for a long time, at least-is the way it tells us a story we think we've heard countless times before but with a refreshingly different tone and degree of detail.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The overall production design - including the opening titles - looks a lot more like TV than a feature film.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> There's a pleasantly low-fi, bare-bones kind of storytelling here, at least before the movie's mysteries are boringly explained - another apocalypse to parse.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> A curious blend of our newly acquired taste for dystopia alongside a healthy sprinkling of Lord of the Flies, the film offers familiar pleasures without prompting the sense of having already been here before.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Like too many big-screen treatments of best-selling dystopian novels, you half-watch it while thinking about when fall TV comes back and what to eat for dinner.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Rare is the movie based on a best-seller that is vastly superior to the book that inspired it. "The Maze Runner" is just such a rarity.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> The Maze Runner isn't flashy but Ball makes the Glade a believably intimidating place, part Lord of the Flies with a touch of The Hunger Games.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> This month's "young adults save the future" sci-fi franchise...yawn.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.56 <###> The acting is solid, but inevtiably "The Maze Runner" doesn't feel that satisying to complete.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.66 <###> It's ending may feel underwhelming, but the fun of a maze is never in it's completion, right?
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> I couldn't help getting hooked by the combination of fine acting, intriguing premise and riveting scenery -- even if the story, at times, was a bit too easy.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> The Maze Runner doesn't eff around... Finally, a YA adaptation that even Michael Haneke or Gaspar Noe might enjoy.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The sophistication of The Hunger Games and its sequels is setting a benchmark that none of the series' rivals has yet managed to match. This one doesn't change anything.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The dark, concrete corridors of the maze provide the venue for one exciting action sequence, but beyond these superficial thrills, there's little emotional weight to the film.
771349837 <###> The Maze Runner <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Another young adult sci-fi tale of survival is played out to sparsely thrilling and all too familiar results, proving the popular genre has run its course.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The feeling upon the closing credits is one of relief; with the plot nicely tied up, hopefully Shawn Levy gets the hint and finally moves on to try new things with his career.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> As if to make amends for the dubious ethics of the previous sequel (why did Ben Stiller get to decide 'his' museum exhibits were more worthy of life than the ones in the Smithsonian?), this supposed series finale has something of a wised-up, elegiac tone.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> If you keep it busy enough, people won't notice how slapdash the plot is.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> ...sporadically entertaining yet ultimately disappointing...
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Liked the first two NATM films? Then guess what? Director Shawn Levy and his producers knew better than the mess with a formula that works and so have delivered more of the same...Throwaway fun.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The core charm of the series has always revolved around fusty old museum exhibits coming to life after opening hours, and the novelty still hasn't quite worn off.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The appearances of Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney (who have both since died) adds extra poignance to a film that pretty much follows the contours of its predecessors.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Larry and his crew head for London and more slightly laboured mayhem, with slapstick gags that seem designed for younger viewers.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> I wept for for Teddy Roosevelt, Mr. Robin Williams. In one of his last screen appearances, there's moments when it feels as though he's saying goodbye to us.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The movie is dedicated to Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney (who also makes a return appearance), which isn't a bad way for a franchise to go out.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A tepid, sedate, snoozy affair, giving none of its famous people in the supporting cast much to do at all.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Given the themes explored, and the potential in the enchantment coming to an abrupt end - this picture should be more poignant and heartfelt than what transpires.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> "We're making a terrible mistake!" somebody yells during this sequel's '30s prologue. What follows proves that dire prediction to be unfounded.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Send-off for an uber-bland family franchise that has never really embraced the anarchic spirit of its Toy Story-riffing high-concept.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> An affectionate closer for the series - and two of its performers, Mickey Rooney and Robin Williams.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Somewhere amid the rictus grins of this cynical seasonal offering there lurks the spectre of the old-school variety show in which tradition demands that you applaud a string of famous people for simply turning up, rather than actually being any good.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It's clear the Museum franchise is running on fumes. Tell that to Ben Stiller and Rebel Wilson.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Scrambled slapstick marks this bittersweet farewell to Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is a fun enough trilogy-capper for every family or fan that has followed the series.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> What began as a fun and unique high-concept comedy with 2006's Night at the Museum is by this third installment bereft of life and creativity.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> This really is a hopeless project that makes little of the original film's few good ideas and adds no new ones worth enduring.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Mediocre action "threequel" is livened by stellar cast.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Even for the third entry in a family franchise, the construction is lazy to the point of indifference.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Made from the "kids-won't-care-how-badly-we-slapped-this-thing-together" school of filmmaking.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> I can't remember when a movie has surprised me as much as this one. I was so much not a fan of the first two but with new writers and a sparkling performance by Dan Stevens as Sir Lancelot it has lots of laugh out loud lines.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Now in its third instalment, it's clearer than ever that this franchise is based on one joke that has been stretched far beyond the breaking point.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The best of the now three - I even laughed twice -and it's the last time we'll see Robin Williams or Mickey Rooney. Swan songs for great actors deserve better.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.51 <###> The movie itself is harmless and needless and would have been forgotten by the ages if it weren't for the fact that it gave us one last chance to remember something greater.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This film, like this franchise, was never going to be great ---- but if you can get into its gee-whiz vibe and its mix of stonefaced deadpans and serious slapstick, you're in for a movie you will appreciate and your kids will love.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> The antidote for too much smiling and happiness during the holiday season.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The exhibits in this "Night at the Museum" may still come to life nightly. But their latest movie stays stubbornly inert.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A surprisingly enjoyable, fitfully entertaining romp for all the family, with a satisfying gag count.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Funny, charming kiddie-flick fare.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Like many a sequel that has exhausted its plot possibilities, Secret of the Tomb looks abroad to add color and culture.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> With the exception of a winsomely sentimental denouement, this is exceedingly humdrum stuff.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Let the dust finally settle on these museum pieces.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This conclusive entry in the franchise has been rendered with skills, smarts and no small amount of heart.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> In becoming what film industry bean-counters like to call a franchise, the Night At The Museum pictures have rather exhausted what, the first time out, in 2006, was a fair-sized dollop of comic novelty and charm.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> This final edition of Night of the Museum is not only a fitting end to the series. It is a sheer delight.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The series now brings chaos to real-life museum director Neil MacGregor's London domain and along the way reveals what happens when characters from those disputed Parthenon bas-reliefs strut their funky stuff.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Not every movie merits a series, and not every series deserves a fond farewell.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Instead of crafting a meaningful family comedy with some low level of educational integrity, Shawn Levy and his cohorts merely string together a series of sensational, kiddie-pleasing visuals.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Nice effects work, a relatively swift-moving narrative, sweet performances, and, by now, a well-worn premise prove inspiring this time out, and not deadening.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Assuming Wilson isn't being eyed as Stiller's replacement (or are we starting rumors?), it's satisfying to see this series ultimately shake off the relic dust and bow out with energy.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.1 <###> If you think that the only thing missing from the volcanic eruption in ancient Pompeii was a urinating monkey, you're in luck.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Instead of celebrating history and its educational advantages, the Museum franchise treats the past like a patsy, robbing it of both its dignity and its meaning
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Good-natured and entertainingly surreal ...
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Ben Stiller and crew go for the easy laughs, spackling the cracks in their armor with a cavalcade of marquee-name cameos and one dizzying action scene after another.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Granted, this series is primarily for kids, but nobody should feel dumber after watching a movie with "museum" in the title.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The film as a whole is still merely decent, but the bar has definitely been raised here.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Against the odds, perhaps, but part three injects a tiring franchise with new life and some surprisingly dark jokes.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Williams glows briefly in one of his final roles, but the overall magic feels dim.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Mainly for "Night at the Museum" diehards.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Other than some stock establishing shots of London, the British setting is wasted, as are Ben Kingsley and Ricky Gervais, who, at times, seem almost embarrassed to be caught on camera.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It's a hectic pileup, this movie, but at least in its final laps it takes the time to say its goodbyes more or less properly.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> "Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb" is a rather lackluster affair, a cash grab that tries to aim a little higher but confuses sappy shortcuts with real emotion.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> For all the CGI whiz-bang and volumes of encyclopedia figures to play with, director Shawn Levy still hasn't figured out how to make the proceedings exciting.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> One doesn't come to a movie of this sort expecting anybody's best work. Or at least one certainly shouldn't, because it won't materialize.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Moments ... come close to realising the franchise's much-grasped-at potential as timeless children's entertainment.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> What is unexpected is the depth of emotion of many of the situations ...
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A rehash of old gags told with half the zip and a rather depressing send-off for two comedy legends.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> There's a serenity to museum visits, especially if it's a place you know and love. "Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb," amazingly, recaptures that feeling in big-studio franchise form.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> More meh than manic, too reliant on wide shots of the ragtag Museum of Natural History cohorts striding down corridors.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Levy -- who directed all three movies -- just couldn't muster up enough freshness to make this installment stand out from others.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Where the previous films felt frenetic and forced, this outing feels breezier, more enjoyable and less contrived.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Gen X avatar Stiller, having made his own way and found some peace, must now confront the fact that his son has his own plans for life and how to live it.

771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Like your average gallery, Night at the Museum:Secret of the Tomb is the same tour you've been on before, just with a few new visiting exhibits.

771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Lacks the energy of the first two but should still please the kiddies. Still, the franchise seems to have run out of gas.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Three decent jokes, 97 minutes. A sad farewell for Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> In the end, "Secret of the Tomb" certainly wasn't necessary, but its earnest goofiness is hard to resist.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> On the evidence of this outing, it's probably best to put the franchise in permanent storage.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's breezy, big-hearted, fitfully amusing and mildly educational. If this is your ten-year-old's movie franchise of choice, you're probably on to a good thing.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> This third and supposedly final edition in the franchise is nothing more than an uncomfortably transparent contractual obligation.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is so laboured and lousy it makes you want to punch yourself in the face.
771349839 <###> Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The most worthy figure from British history the writers can think to reincarnate is - wait for it - Sir Lancelot.
771034026 <###> Adios Momo <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> A tenderhearted slice of magical realism!

770685912 <###> Foster Child <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Like Cristian Mungiu did in 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, Brillante Mendoza attempts to take the camera from the opening shot of Touch of Evil to quotidian life in the slums.
770891037 <###> Visions of 8 - The Olympics of Motion Picture Achievement <###> Documentary;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.8 <###> Visions of Eight is an excellent record of the 1972 Munich Olympics, a collage imaginatively recording the event from varied perspectives, each with a different focus.
770891037 <###> Visions of 8 - The Olympics of Motion Picture Achievement <###> Documentary;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.4 <###> As for so much of the rest, it seems to forget that it is the privilege of the modest art of film to find the meaning of things just in the way they are seen to be.
770891037 <###> Visions of 8 - The Olympics of Motion Picture Achievement <###> Documentary;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.75 <###> What nobody could have anticipated, perhaps, is how similar many of those visions would be.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A raunchy unpleasant comedy that wastes its talented cast.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Cameron Diaz eats the screen up in Bad Teacher but can't withstand the enormously dim-witted script.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A raunchy comedy that promises, from its title to its casting, a "Bad Santa" riff on a sacred institution...But they don't deliver.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Crass, charmless and not especially funny, Bad Teacher is like a school kid trying to be cool.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> In the end, despite how thinly-plotted the film is, there are several laughs to be had, and that goes a long way.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Bad Teacher doesn't quite get an F. But an acceptable C+ is pretty fair.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Kadan's direction is adequate with everything competently done, but there's nothing here that manages to make you laugh out loud. Could someone tell the current crop of Hollywood filmmakers to find some new jokes?
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The problem isn't that Diaz's character is such a mean-spirited person, it's that her motives for being that way are completely contrived.It might have been a good short film, but that's about it.

771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The story is predictably thin and the jokes suitably unsophisticated, but the clever characterisations help this paint-by-numbers comedy limp over the line to "watchable".
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Weirdly ill-conceived. Diaz is good and very believable as ... the most dislikable character I've encountered in a film in a long time ... [which] makes for a lousy movie.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The only way to understand this movie's argument about performance pay is to imagine Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker watching it.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> She's not somewhat bad, she's not repentantly bad and she's certainly not sympathetically bad. Nope, she's just plain ol' bad. And that is a thing of rare beauty.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> ... more interesting (albeit disheartening) for what it seems to say about public-school teachers ...
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> This is too easy, but I'm going to do it anyway: Bad Teacher? Bad movie.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> While a few of Diaz's scenes with Timberlake and his gift for the deadpan seem as if they're going to amount to something, the script's dialogue fails them.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.64 <###> Ultimately, Bad Teacher is easy to like precisely because it doesn't try very hard to be liked.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Attitude divorced from any insight or even coherence, mere posturing at best.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> ...a failure of dishearteningly monumental proportions...
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> And you thought Santa was bad.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Its trash-can humor is tasteless, no doubt, but hey, that doesn't make it unpalatable.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Would 'Bridesmaids' have worked if audiences had been asked to sympathize with a meaner version of Rose Byrne and root against Kristen Wiig?
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Joins the depressingly long list of movies that are simply hard to get worked up about one way or the other.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> If its master plot is utterly predictable, the way it unfolds is unapologetically cartoony and weird.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Both Bad Santa and the Bad Lieutenants (Keitel and Cage) were really bad, but they were entertaining. Cameron Diaz's Bad Teacher, Elizabeth, is neither.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> This is a case of a movie not being "bad" enough to be good.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Provided you're in the mood for salacious fare, this titillating teensploit does deliver the requisite number of raunchy rib ticklers to be worth the investment for the testosterone-driven demographic.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A great supporting cast isn't enough since Diaz and Timberlake just aren't funny.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Bad Teacher should be held back for bad comedy. It's the kind of movie that after the first ten minutes, one decides whether to leave or stay hoping for one or two chuckles that might come.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Sure, Diaz' character doesn't undergo some cliched redemption, but she doesn't evolve in any other way, either.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A frustrating mix of smart flash and smirking impudence.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Bad Teacher gets a shiny new apple thanks to a raunchy turn by Diaz
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> While there are problems with ... a failure to maintain a consistent tone, Diaz is never less than exhilarating in a guilty pleasure way, even when hunched over her desk with an expression of glazed, disheveled contempt. Actually, especially then.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Foul - and not even funny.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It's no Bad Santa, but Bad Teacher brings just enough naughty behavior to the table to make it a decent watch for viewers tired of PG-13 timidity.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> [The] film asks us to identify with a woman who behaves rather heinously, while it relies on her mean-spiritedly outrageous behavior to sustain all 92 minutes.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Hard to root for such a selfish lead, but "Bad Teacher" has just enough politically incorrect humor to warrant a grade of B.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Even though the picture is far from perfect, I was never less than amused. The terrific cast and some individual bits of comedy were enough to keep me invested.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Diaz lets her wardrobe and bad attitude do the work for her, but she's left high and dry at the end of the film when it abruptly tries to redeem Elizabeth's bad behavior.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The best lines were harvested for the trailer -- so if you've seen that, you've seen it all.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Diaz, always a deft comic, makes the most as this potty-mouthed party girl whose age is bearing down on her.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Shame the flick's just a one-note joke because, sight unseen, Bad Teacher had me at the title.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Raunchy Diaz, Timberlake comedy aims low, misses the target.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> A comedy that wants us to cheer for a nasty and self-absorbed teacher who breaks all the rules.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Although you should be prepared for its raunchiness, it starts off as brightly as Matilda on steroids.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The film is fast and often funny. And while it's not for children - really - I bet the adults who just spent a school year with them are going to love it.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Yes, the plot is lacking but it is the lack of any socially redeeming qualities makes Cameron Diaz Bad Teacher as seductive to us as she is to Diaz.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Cameron Diaz is now officially on my roster of Hot Talented Actresses Who Should Stop Being in Romantic Comedies So Much.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> There are just enough laughs in this movie to almost make you forget that there's very little supporting them.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Has no appreciable arc for any of the characters and if it wasn't for the work of Jason Segel who appears to have shown up with his own script, this would have been an even more brutal affair.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> This fitfully funny but mostly dull misfire defines exactly where the line can be drawn between truly subversive humor and lazy cynicism.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> As film school assignments go, Bad Teacher is a potentially "A" topic with a "C" result that would require considerable remedial writing to upgrade.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There's a dark, acid-tongued comedy to be made from this premise with these characters, but this bland "Teacher" just isn't bad enough.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A fitfully amusing comedy that promises far more outrageousness than it actually delivers.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Bad Teacher is more like a rebellious teen acting out against her parents than a truly rotten to the core degenerate kid. I guess you could say it's Kim Kardashian instead of being Lindsay Lohan.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> "Bad Teacher" immediately brings "Bad Santa" to mind and suffers by the comparison.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Diaz is absolutely fearless in portraying a character with almost no redeeming features.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Cameron Diaz is the reason charter schools exist.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> If you've never seen Bad News Bears, Bad Santa, or one of a dozen other better movies about adults being mean to kids, maybe you'll think this is funny.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Screenwriters Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg fare better here than with their first film, "Year One." But like I said in my review of that film, if these guys are truly penning "Ghostbusters III," they have a lot to learn.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Where the screenplay mostly falters is populating the school with unproductive supporting characters.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> When the end arrives at the 89-minute mark the immediate reaction is that it was too slight by a half and a lot safer than expected.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> There's so much wrong with the basic setup of [the film] that it never really gets a chance to be as funny as it could be.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The film's rhythms are disjointed, and there are tedious patches and gaping holes in the story. No one bothered to create anything beyond a vague outline of a superficial character.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The picture doesn't inspire or reward high expectations, but it raises smiles.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The main problem is that Hollywood finds it next to impossible to break out of the mold of the "likeable" characters.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Ms. Diaz has found her down-and-dirty element in the kind of broad comedy that threatens to get ugly and more or less succeeds on that threat.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Makes a homecoming bonfire out of schoolroom pieties and drags heroic-educator yarns into the boy's bathroom for a swirlie.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Cameron Diaz's fem spin on Billy Bob Thornton's Bad Santa should have added up to raunchy fun. Sadly, it only took about 10 minutes to wipe the smile off my face.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> It's not often a movie features a cast of characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities, but "Bad Teacher" really hits that one out of the park.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Cameron Diaz looks like she's having a blast in her best role in years.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Barely makes the grade in either humor or provocation.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> a jolly, joke-filled escape
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> This movie is what you do when you have never been to school or don't like education. Or movies, comedies, women, breasts, sex, or dodgeball.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Bad Teacher is a promising concept in need of more promising material.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Diaz is funny, all right, but she is no miracle worker, so she can't erase the movie's slow spots or make it feel shorter than its 92-minute running time (it feels much, much longer, never a good sign for a comedy).
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.85 <###> Bad Teacher is hardly a perfect picture, but in the context of every other comedy on the summer movie landscape - from the faux empowerment of Bridesmaids to the neurotic frat-guy heteromania of The Hangover Part II - it feels revolutionary.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The classroom comedy "Bad Teacher" could have been sent to detention for copying off of "Bad Santa," but it's brazenly funny in its own right - until it turns into a goody two-shoes.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.87 <###> For a one joke movie Bad Teacher plays a lot of attention to details.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The concept titillates - an oversexed, drug-abusing, foul-mouthed, doesn't-give-a-s--- woman put in charge of a classroom - but the result is drab, obvious, and disappointing.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Surprisingly likable for a movie populated exclusively by idiots and jerks.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> "Bad Teacher" is a pulled punch, a pot-smoking/kid cussing/teacher copulating farce that is less than the sum of its parts.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Kasdan and writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg construct the film as a series of set pieces, some funnier than others.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Simply serves Hollywood formula, while pretending to be above it.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Although the script could be better, this is still a fairly entertaining film.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> By no means terrible or unbearable, though it's slightly disappointing after the brilliance of Kasdan's previous movie.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A refreshingly raucous comedy that comes surprisingly close to completely living up to its lack of conviction...
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A brainless comedy to escape from the grind.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Vainly strives for outrageousness via dry-humping, nude-pic blackmail scams, and desperate cracks about blacks, Jews, and "Orientals."
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The movie's nods to the bare-bones economics of educators' lives are subversive and admirable.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Filthy and unredeeming in all of the right ways, Bad Teacher is a worthy successor to the benchmark black comedy Bad Santa (without being at all the same).
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It's good for a few laughs but in the end neither outrageous nor accurate enough.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> This is one of those comedies that terribly misjudges the reverse appeal of its central character.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Diaz's Bad Teacher might not give an F, but just about scrapes a B- herself.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> It's a comedy tour-de-force from Diaz, backed up by great performances all round.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A character so unpleasant and so self-centered, you watch her with the same repelled fascination usually aimed at a rattlesnake.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The acting is uniformly on the button, but the script is patchier.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A high-school satire that is reasonably funny, though far from sure how badass it really wants to be.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Lift the bonnet, unfortunately, and this movie's engine is too sputtering and feeble to get it anywhere.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's brisk, puerile fun with added charm thanks to the game cast. A bit like watching your teachers make twits of themselves.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Diaz's game charms are semi-squandered on a script that's two-thirds filler. Not quite detention, but on thin ice.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Broader than Bad Santa and less consistently funny, it's still gleefully rude, crude and often a lot of fun.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Kasdan bundles together a mishmash of high-school movie cliches and off-colour toilet humour, with the flimsy plot and faltering pace providing far too few laughs.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Cameron Diaz eats the screen in Bad Teacher and the screen says "thank you".
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Diaz has a girlish charm that means she gets away with a series of cynical pranks, even though she's not quite as big and clever as she thinks she is.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Diaz shows off her comedy chops, displaying the kind of sunny charisma (despite the hangovers) that has charmed audiences since There's Something About Mary.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A disappointing, surprisingly unfunny comedy that fails thanks to a lazy, poorly structured plot, an uneven tone and a refusal to commit to its basic premise.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's a basic but amusing farce gifted with enough sharp lines to carry you through the lean patches.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's worth a look alone to see ex-real-life partners Diaz and Timberlake's former favourite sex position re-enacted - or just for Diaz in all her glory ...
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Bad Teacher could have dared to push the 15-rating further, and it probably would have been funnier as a result, but on the back of a refreshingly irreverent turn from Cameron Diaz, the flaws are easy to forgive.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The film's main stock-in-trade is the kind of faintly bizarre, offbeat gags that you might find in a decent US sitcom - which is no bad thing and also makes sense given the writers' Office pedigree.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> This film strains so badly to be a black comedy that it does itself an injury.
771030879 <###> Bad Teacher <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Twenty minutes in, you'll begin to feel like you're in detention.
10392 <###> The Private Eyes <###> Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Silly laughs, far beneath the two comedy stars.
454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.4 <###> Asylum had promise. But it's bad enough to make one wonder just who had the loose screws -- the characters, or the people who filmed them?
454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> It's a movie you fall for or you don't, and like Stella, I am not ashamed I did.
454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> There is nothing to Stella's character -- or any of these characters, for that matter -- that you can relate to.
454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> Based on Pat McCabe's moody novel, Asylum has an over-the-top feverishness that suits its premise.

454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> Marton Csokas ... comes across as a hybrid of Russell Crowe and Clive Owen in full-on brooding mode and has a genuine chemistry with Richardson that goes some way to explaining why she stays with him as a long as she does.
454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> The film wryly wonders whether the lunatics have taken over not just the asylum but the entire world as well.
454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> The film manages to turn potentially interesting characters into caricatures and potentially heady material into soap-opera melodrama.
454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> The film, with its uniformly terrific cast, stern Gothic overtones and steady but measured pacing, is a crisp, old-fashioned delight, eschewing cheap tricks for repeated tiny pricks of unease that work up to a continuous gnawing dread.
454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> Richardson's no-holds-barred performance captures Stella's rekindled passion and despair when things go to hell. Alas, the story goes to hell with her.
454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> The film is basically a string of repetitive ruts.
454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> A gothic fairytale.

454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.4 <###> For a story about infatuation, sex and violence, the film is almost strikingly dull.

454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> The morbid interiority of McGrath's novel has been turned into distressed gloss, and while it's awfully nice to look at, it never once comes close to the dangerous emotions of the real thing.
454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.7 <###> Like a romance novel brought to life - high melodrama and deep emotions and a couple who want to be together, but something stands in their way.
454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.7 <###> The makers of Asylum pretend they're making an art movie, and although the film has the trappings, the story is mostly Hollywood.

454606900 <###> Asylum <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.4 <###> It's too over-the-top, too lurid and at times simply too silly to represent any kind of valid commentary on the repressive '50s or the way in which institutions tend to destroy rather than cure.

771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.5 <###> It's a second installment of a film bio of Ip Man, and it's pretty much made-up nonsense, but few will care, as it's also great fun.
771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.7 <###> The movie is simply an entertaining second chance to see more of this man of character in action.
771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.5 <###> One of the highest-grossing films in Hong Kong history, but it doesn't add much to the crowded history of martial-arts movies.
771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.75 <###> Despite this slackening of narrative urgency, Wilson Yip has duplicated the flawed approach of the earlier movie with striking exactitude.
771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.8 <###> When Donnie Yen is up there defying gravity and seemingly breaking the sound barrier with his fists, a lot is forgiven.
771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.8 <###> While the film as a whole is a graceful, yet lethal, dig at chauvinism as well as imperialism, that is no impediment to it also being both an engrossing drama and a dynamic martial-arts flick
771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.69621 <###> Viscerally exhilarating and thrilling in its brilliantly-choreographed fight sequences, but less engaging during its contrived moments of drama.

771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.7 <###> Doesn't quite touch the laurels of its predecessor, but the weaker, unoriginal storyline is forgivable in light of how entertaining Ip Man 2 is and its maintenance of the original's high standard of excellent martial arts action.
771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.6 <###> You're never at a loss to figure out who is fighting who, as in so many Western actioners these days, and Yen is the very model of simmering understatement.
771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.625 <###> "Ip Man 2" has eye candy to spare. But it is lacking in formalities such as character development and plot coherence, and the stereotyped Brits are straight out of central casting.
771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.7 <###> Director Wilson Yip keeps the movie moving as fast as the whiplash action.
771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.7 <###> Announced before the first Ip Man was in general release, this smart, equally-enthralling sequel to the hit 2008 film looks to do even better U.S. business than its predecessor.
771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.6 <###> The film's fight choreography is again handled by the legendary Sammo Hung - he also now has a supporting role and incredibly shot his own fight scenes while recuperating from heart surgery - and that alone makes the film worth checking out.

771040112 <###> Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.39 <###> Its blatant recycling of the plot structure of its predecessor combined with its complete lack of further development of any of its characters, makes the overall film a tedious sit.
12220 <###> Race the Sun <###> Drama;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Far from groundbreaking, but a bit of fun
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> The film's unique script strangely succeeds in mashing together both intense violence and grand comedy.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Martin McDonagh's Seven Psychopaths is a sharp piece of fun that both pokes at the current climate of filmmaking while also adding its own brand of humor to the mix.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> If it doesn't quite match In Bruges in terms of total success, it's still potent enough to indicate that McDonagh managed to dodge the dreaded sophomore slump.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Though it seems derivative at times, it's offbeat, it's violent, it's well written, and it's well acted.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The sense that the different elements don't really add up to much may well leave some feeling cold; for others, the sharp dialogue and comic beats will produce a similar fondness for the characters that In Bruges' best scenes did.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> McDonagh achieves the tricky feat of balancing cleverness, carnage, and compassion.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> ...the moment to moment of the unparalleled craziness that experimental narrative, character dexterity and into the depths of McDonagh's necessary second album psychosis.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> ...an entertainingly erratic effort...
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> At times, the galloping absurdity drifts into off-the-peg comedy gangster cliche. But McDonagh's brilliant way with one-liners always claws back enough ground to stifle any groans.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Martin McDonagh gleefully plays with both the gang thriller genre and the moviemaking process with this enjoyably absurd action comedy. It's a little self-indulgent, acknowledging how difficult he found it to follow up his acclaimed film In Bruges.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> There's not much point to a meta-film once the actual film has ceased to grip.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> [A] black comedy loaded with some fabulous, all-American visual touches.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> McDonagh has enough ideas for six films, but with them all crammed into one, the effect of each is lost.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Too much is so clever-clever that it borders on the stupid.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It loses its way after a while but the performances are excellent and there's some jaunty dialogue.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Self-aware stupidity does not equal wit.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Christopher Walken has starred in over one hundred movies and whether he is playing a deer hunter or a dog-napper, has there ever been a better scene stealer?
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Clever, ludic, perky, perspicacious - and ever so slightly tiring.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> After a while the narrative falters, the ideas flag and it simply gets dull ...
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> McDonagh is undoubtedly a very clever man, but with Seven Psychopaths he is interested in nothing more than celebrating his own cleverness.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The performances are superb and the dialogue is often hilarious, but the script is both all over the place and not nearly as clever as it thinks it is.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A movie about making a movie that constantly reminds us we're watching a movie, with characters discussing what should happen in the "movie" movie that naturally winds up influencing the movie we're all watching. Kind of.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Hilarious, unwieldy, clever, snarky and snide it may be, but it's always entertaining.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> You'll definitely enjoy this film if you like your humour black and bloody.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> McDonagh is less saturated in film and pop culture than Tarantino and less prone than Kaufman to disappear down story wormholes.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> If there's a certain thrill in watching bad guys getting their brains sprayed across a wall, it's surpassed by the intrigue of having a filmmaker reveal the inner workings of his own mind.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Walken is such a joy, I felt like instantly rewinding his every scene. But amazingly, he doesn't completely steal the show
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Admittedly, there are longueurs, but when it's funny, it's hilarious; when it's tense, it's powerful; and most of the time, its demented brio is a joy to watch.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Enormously entertaining, endlessly quotable, perfectly cast and packed full of the richest acting you'll see from an ensemble cast all year, but the result is ever so slightly hollow.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> As enjoyable as this movie is, there are holes.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Despite a great cast, a great premise and some great ham acting - a must whenever Christopher Walken walks into frame - the movie's lack of focus keeps it from kicking out of second gear and into the kind of crazy groove it clearly strives for.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Seven Psychopaths is almost certainly not the movie you'll be expecting it to be, but as long as you stick with it, this is one of its greatest strengths, not a weakness.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> I think McDonagh is really cleaver. I mean he's taking on Hollywood and the screenplay; the conceit of writing a screenplay within a screenplay. He's having digs at the violence in films while indulging in the violence in films.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The film as a whole is fiercely funny; there are twists galore with some wonderful performances, especially from Rockwell and Walken whose scene-stealing skills are front and centre in this non-PC but thoroughly entertaining romp.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> For all the darkly comic asides and witty conversations in McDonagh's script, the gag he clearly takes the most pleasure in is the ol' genre bait-and-switch. They come for the gangland violence; they stay for the story seminar.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> It can't hope to match its predecessor for charm and accessibility. Where In Bruges felt droll and gentler in tone, Seven Psychopaths is unwieldy, ramshackle and gory.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> I procrastinate because I care and because writing reviews of movies you love is hard. And I really loved Martin McDonagh's Seven Psychopaths.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A more purely entertaining film you'd be hard pressed to find; Seven Psychopaths is best enjoyed as an unabashed hell-raiser that's also bloody funny.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> A dark comedy that leaves the fun out of funny
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> When the film itself is jerking you around, the cast is carrying you through it.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> McDonagh manages to have it both ways
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> For those who aren't averse to a bit of gallows humor, Seven Psychopaths is just original and morbid enough to be genuinely memorable.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> If this sounds like a shaggy-shih-tzu story rather than a tightly plotted thriller, it is - and that's part of the joke.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> [McDonagh] continues to mix crime and dark comedy, but this time he adds a layer of self-awareness, deconstructing both the writing process and the need for conflict (and/or violence) in writing.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Engagingly off-centre, like Charlie Kaufman taking down Quentin Tarantino, this sunbaked shaggy-dog story is a place-holder film for McDonagh, and often closer to chaos than it is to genius.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> That it invokes unfavourable comparisons to Adaptation doesn't necessarily make Seven Psychopaths a failure, but you do find yourself wishing that McDonagh had the foresight to ruin his own movie with as much precision as Charlie Kaufman had.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> If your cringe threshold is high enough, this is one of the funniest comedies of the year.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> A movie that is one of the most aggressively self-reflexive and self-lacerating in modern memory.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> One of the most gratifying, witty and intelligent films of the year.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> Rockwell and Walken are at their best in this violent tale. What more could you possibly want?
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> There's a lot going on here, but it all amounts to a really good time.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> You could have Farrell, Rockwell, Walken and Harrelson sit around discussing municipal building codes and it would still be more entertaining than 60 percent of the movies that came out this year.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> Irish playwright and filmmaker Martin McDonagh doesn't make movies; they're more like balancing acts.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> In what could have been an over-the-top, one note performance Rockwell gives Billy a heart and, more importantly, a soul.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> This is one of the best times I've had at the movies in years.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Seven Psychopaths isn't interested in complete narrative coherency, only with ridiculous flights of fancy and layering joke upon joke as McDonagh skewers the modern crime genre and just about every other action movie trope.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Ultimately, the experience of watching "Seven Psychopaths" is akin to watching a dog like Bonnie chase its tail: It's only funny until you realize that the running in circles isn't ever really going to stop.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Seven Psychopaths is seven times the fun of most movies.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> McDonagh accomplishes all of this in a way that'll remind you of other filmmakers (but mostly Quentin Tarantino, to reference one of his peers) without feeling copycattish.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Smart enough to work on multiple levels: as a witty salute to masculine '70s cinema...as a deconstruction of same...and as an existential consideration of the role of self-expression in ascribing meaning to life...
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> It's like a BOONDOCK SAINTS for people who have "good" taste in movies.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> How do we suppress our need for moral and even physical justice if we believe that violence leads to damnation? Is there a chance to...oh, never mind. Let's just blow someone's brains out.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Doesn't quite hold together at the end, but it's quite audacious, and supremely entertaining throughout.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Yes, it's a lot to keep track of, but writer-director Martin McDonagh does so with deft humor as the film hurls toward a desert climax, foreshadowed in one of Billy and Marty's exchanges.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This is what Adaptation might've looked like had Charlie Kaufman been hired to pen a flippantly nihilistic wiseguy saga instead of an unfilmable ode to orchids.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> ...often sublimely hilarious, with Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken doing their loony best to keep the ramshackle affair going.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Moviegoers who can handle philosophical musings accompanied by exploding heads will find that McDonagh has delivered another sharp and entertaining film.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Seven Psychopaths isn't a great movie -- there are stretches where it has too much going on for its own good -- but it is an inspired, strange, and occasionally choke-on-your-popcorn funny ensemble piece.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Rockwell is impressive as the manic Billy, while Walken steals his scenes as he gives Hans a world-weary seriousness that keeps McDonagh's weird world nicely grounded.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> With a truly original script, premise, and insightful structural deconstruction, Seven Psychopaths offers entertainment at its sharpest and most perceptive.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> McDonagh is such a clever writer, his dialogue and directions sparkle with such amazing clarity, that you can't help but be impressed.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.95 <###> Nearly every conversation is just absurd though, but it's so absurd that it makes way too much sense. The phrase, "That's just crazy enough to work!" was meant for this film.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> For about 75 minutes, Seven Psychopaths is a rollicking good movie - kinetic, clever, funny, and brutal. Then, inexplicably, it falls apart.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> McDonagh sets real (and very different) moods for his stories-within-stories. The Los Angeles locations - apart from the obligatory Hollywood sign - seem fresh.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> This flick never pretends to be anything but a bright hall of fun-house mirrors. And there, so gloriously distorted, gargoyles look right at home.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Too many of its moments of let's-subvert-the-genre seem to leave McDonagh stranded and flailing at just the moment when a Tarantino movie or a Chuck Palahniuk novel is snapping into place.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A toxic little bauble of Hollywood gestures, cliches and tropes.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> ...a violent, profane and hilariously dark comedy about gangsters and lowlifes mixing it up in California.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> Suggestive of a blisteringly good-humored Quentin Tarantino (sans the uber gore), McDonagh possesses a rare talent for ushering black comedy to a bleak end, luring his audience into laughter all along its shootapalooza way.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> "Seven Psychopaths" has to be counted as a disappointment.

771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Meta to the max, filled with clever jokes and observations that stick like barbs and deflated ones that land with a thud, "Seven Psychopaths" is a leisurely riff about movies, violence, storytelling and the art of the steal.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> What movie junkie out there wouldn't leap at the chance to see merry pranksters such as Christopher Walken, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson go nuts in something called Seven Psychopaths? It's crazy-killer fun.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Put a gun in the hands of Woody Harrelson and some glorious gab in the mouth of Christopher Walken - the most deadpan of deadpanning thespians - and it's impossible not to make something of this profanity-flying conflation.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> With its blend of low-rent gangster cool, high-body-count hipster violence, smart-mouth dialogue, inspired casting and a blissfully retro soundtrack...[this]might have been a groundbreaking film -- in 1992.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> For a good hour, Seven Psychopaths is lively, bloody fun. Then the yawning starts.
771271681 <###> Seven Psychopaths <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> 'Seven Psychopaths" is many things, chief among them a long-overdue love letter to Christopher Walken and a crudely drawn ransom note from Sam Rockwell.

10578 <###> Hannah and Her Sisters <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> The marvel of Hannah and Her Sisters is just how many fully realized characters and relationships Allen is able to weave into the fabric of this extraordinarily well-written film.

10578 <###> Hannah and Her Sisters <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> The plot could easily have been an afternoon soap opera, but Allen has infused it with wit, a superb cast and his usual 'the best direction is the least direction' style, so that the camera never calls attention to itself.

10578 <###> Hannah and Her Sisters <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Allen's writing and directing style is so strong and assured in this film that the actual filmmaking itself becomes a narrative voice, just as we sense Henry James behind all of his novels, or William Faulkner or Iris Murdoch behind theirs.
10578 <###> Hannah and Her Sisters <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.83 <###> Like many films in the Allen oeuvre, the plot plays second fiddle to the issues. Which is not to say there is no story. There is. But it's more a slice of life.

771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Ill-conceived and ill-timed, this unfunny yuppies' lament couldn't be more insulting to single parents, women, or anyone struggling to make a living. Excuse me while I cry as success ruins the characters' perfect lives.

771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> This is the cinematic equivalent of comfort food. It goes down easy and may not be the most nutritious meal, but if you're in the mood for it, nothing else will do.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> SJP's superficial balancing act predictably collapses.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> There are plenty of skilled people behind this female-empowerment movie, but the film badly botches its core message.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> It's not worth the quality time you could be spending with your children or the extra change in your wallet.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> To make matters worse, the movie doesn't really have a true resolution and 90 minutes later I'm still not sure how she does it.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.1 <###> I not only have nothing nice to say about this movie, but it also is so bad it is a struggle to say anything about it at all.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> How nice it would have been had McKenna penned a couple of those audience-addressing interludes for Richard or Jack. What would these modern, succesful men tell us of themselves?
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.49 <###> By using cliche characters as gags and not actually developing any of its female leads but one it simply reaffirms all the issues its story is trying to dispell.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's not a bad film, per se, but it's more adequate than entertaining, more routine than recommendable.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> The main problem is that this Boston-set flick quite unselfconsciously presents itself as if it were a pop-culture first to express ideas about the working-mom balancing act.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Frantic working mom tale won't have much teen appeal.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> not the worst example of the genre. Nor is it even the worst of its own particular sub-genre, the Sarah Jessica Parker chick-flick. This should not, however, be misconstrued as an endorsement
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> One "AAACK!" short of a Cathy comic strip.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> What should have been a challenging, inspirational, laugh-out-loud romantic comedy about a mother trying to make the best of the see-saw challenge between work and home isn't very good at all.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Let's start asking how she does it when she is a single mom with three kids, 10% of the income and no full time nanny. This is where the movie loses us.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Parker's anti-Carrie Bradshaw messiness is coupled to a horse-like grin that is both sentimental and overcooked. I don't know how she gets away with it.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Parker contributes a performance as the flustered but determined Kate Reddy that proves that she can transcend Sex and The City.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A lot more watchable than its awful trailer indicates.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> The retro cattiness of Parker's mother-in-law and of the mothers at her kid's school feels like it time-traveled from three decades ago.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> A meager one-joke comedy peopled by stereotypes.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> The film is so bad it's hard to imagine anything saving it.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Like its main character, "I Don't Know How She Does It" tries to do everything, but it doesn't quite succeed.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Pleasant but consistently rather bland, a light, low-key Lifetime movie with an A-list star and wide theatrical distribution.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Though it aims to be a sharply humorous look at the mommy wars, I Don't Know How She Does It has nothing remotely new or comical in its arsenal.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Spiffy-looking, well-intentioned but ultimately witless.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Too much time and energy is directed toward that go-nowhere story, wasting the film's best asset, which is the low-key, lived-in rapport between Parker and Kinnear.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> "I Don't Know How She Does It" seems stuck in the past.

771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> In describing the conflict of a woman who has it all without enjoying it all, Pearson's book had teeth. McKenna's screenplay has only a smile. But is it ever good to laugh.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> For a film ostensibly concerned with the mess and tumult of modern life, I Don't Know How She Does It presents some pretty pat solutions.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> The film, blah from start to finish, is more likely to sour fond memories than shake off old associations.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The result is like that bake sale pie: All the ingredients are there, but it's really sloppy and not quite fresh.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Occasionally veers so far into absurdity that it manages to make its central character - capable, smart, working mom Kate Reddy - look like a nitwit.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> not spectacularly unfunny or appallingly made; it's just a rote treatment of a familiar subject
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The performances are an understated joy, particularly Brosnan, who convinces as the not-quite-romantic interest, and Kinnear, who makes goodness believable.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> For a supposedly strong character, Kate infuriatingly allows herself to be victimized by everyone around her, even her kids, who withhold affection when they feel she's gone too often because of work.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> For roughly 70 minutes, I Don't Know How She Does It comes across as smart and witty, then it throws all that away in its quest for the perfect conclusion. "Perfect" in this case is synonymous with "fairy tale."
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> I Don't Know does it with charm.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> An endless, painfully predictable film that's a few mentions of purses and closets away from being a Carrie Bradshaw: 7 Years Later spinoff.

771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> For a movie, it's pretty good at that balancing act Kate works so hard to achieve.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> For what it's worth, Kate is Bradshaw in a blender: She still can't cook, but she's embraced the state of motherhood.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Subtlety is never this movie's strong point; then again, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint what this movie's strengths are.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The idea that working moms feel the strain of achieving some balance more than working dads is nothing new. And that's true of most everything in the movie. We've been here and done that, repeatedly, over the past 25 years or more.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The structure doesn't work and the various directorial flourishes can't disguise the fact that nothing really happens, plot-wise.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> "I Don't Know How She Does It" suggests what might have happened to Carrie if she had two kids with Mr. Big to worry about, and less time to obsess over her wardrobe.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> An intriguing feminist manifesto suggesting that trying to be more like a man might be a waste of a woman.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> As retro as a Katherine Heigl chick flick.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Empathy rescues it from the brink of disaster porn -- it's so good-hearted and optimistic that stressed-out moms will feel the flick speaks directly to them, which it does.
771229224 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> I Don't Know How She Does It is a cliche-ridden, misogynistic mess.

771218417 <###> I Travel Because I Have to, I Come Back Because I Love You <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> As singular as its title, "I Travel Because I Have To, I Come Back Because I Love You" embraces road movie, personal journal and trancelike study of arcing grief.
771218417 <###> I Travel Because I Have to, I Come Back Because I Love You <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> The movie's true brilliance comes from its portrayal of how the world curls around you in the grip of heartache-every song on the radio, every face you see, every story you're told reflecting only what you've lost.
771218417 <###> I Travel Because I Have to, I Come Back Because I Love You <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> Krim Ainouz and Marcelo Gomes blend documentary with fiction to forge a tactile, strikingly woozy first-person perspective.
771035571 <###> Body <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Weighty political and philosophic issues may well be buried somewhere in this Body. But it would take an electron microscope to find them.

12012 <###> Smile <###> Drama;Classics;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Great spoof of beauty pageants
12012 <###> Smile <###> Drama;Classics;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> like a season of I Love the '70s condensed into two hours, and in its intimation that this is a uniquely disposable culture it's decades ahead of VH-1
12012 <###> Smile <###> Drama;Classics;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Effective satire on beauty pageants.
12012 <###> Smile <###> Drama;Classics;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Fun spoof of the beauty pageant industry. The kid with his sexual metaphors is the best.

770857818 <###> William S. Burroughs: A Man Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.85 <###> Burroughs was a quasi-obsession of mine during my youth and young manhood, and he's the only Beat (including Keoroac) that I don't feel I have to some extent outgrown. He was also ... an extremely "strange ranger."
770857818 <###> William S. Burroughs: A Man Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> Mostly, "A Man Within'' is a breezily stylized, very enjoyable trot through the writer's life, theme by theme, era by era.
770857818 <###> William S. Burroughs: A Man Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> Fairly disorganized in the telling and rather impersonally told by filmmaker Yony Leyser, this documentary biography of the stone-faced Beat author of The Naked Lunch is still worth seeing.

770857818 <###> William S. Burroughs: A Man Within <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> It's a persuasive documentary; one that ought to gain Burroughs some new converts if the film itself can find a wide enough audience.

11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> Ron Howard's pop-entertainment you-are-there space thriller is easily the most rousing film of the year. And it might make real spaceflight just as nifty as Star Wars for youngsters.
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Partially filmed in genuine weightless conditions, Ron Howard's movie is a technical tour de force.
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Hanks is a terrific choice for the lead because he can appear strong and military without slipping over into Sgt. Rock corniness.

11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> Howard is not above pushing buttons of his own and milking the big moments. But they are indeed big moments, and the manipulation is not intrusive. He has made a can-do movie for our can't-do age.
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Tom Hanks perfectly embodies white bread goodness as mission leader Jim Lovell and, while we may all know the ending, it's a tribute to Howard's no-frills, focused direction that the story remains undeniably gripping.
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> If there is one subject that makes it okay to feel old-fashioned patriotism and pride in humanity... it is surely the US space program.
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> Thrilling, heartwarming, scary, and superb.
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Self-conscious about its heroism with portrayals that lean toward the glib and the professionally uplifting, the film milks our sympathies too readily to be emotionally convincing.
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> Truly a director for the '90s, Ron Howard has mastered the art of spinning big, old-fashioned yarns without any discernible point of view, and his movie is curiously empty and instantly forgettable.

11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> Major, rousing, thoroughly professional Hollywood entertainment that will dazzle you with its re-creations of historical events, take you inside the space capsule and the Houston command center, and leave you wondering where our heroes [have gone].
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> The movie is terrific on nuts-and-bolts stuff, but nuts and bolts aren't the same as drama.
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> Overnight, Howard seems to have turned into a combination of the best aspects of Oliver Stone and Robert Altman.

11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> It seems strange now, a quarter of a century later, than mankind, with vastly superior technology, lacks the will to venture to the other planets or even to go back to the moon. What a world of wimps we have become!
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Just like the mission itself, APOLLO 13 leaves the impression of being both a success and a failure.
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> If you thought Tom Hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star, wait until you've seen him eight stories tall.
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> The transfer to the IMAX screen diminishes none of the film's drama, which was always much more about human emotions than technology.
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> The re-release of Ron Howard's Apollo 13 in the IMAX format proves absolutely that really, really, really good things can come in enormous packages.
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> This story is larger-than-life to begin with, so it is enhanced by the new super-size format. The movie grabs you and doesn't let go for nearly two hours.

11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> The depiction of the rocket launch remains one of the most exhilarating sequences ever captured on film; so realistic that NASA wondered where the filmmakers got the footage.
11116 <###> Apollo 13 <###> Documentary;Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> For reliving this long forgotten go-and-get-it gung-ho mentality and excellent reconstruction of the sense of wonder that surrounded those early space missions Apollo 13 is worth seeing.

770671119 <###> American Gangster <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Though it's certainly admirable to aim high, it's like Frank Lucas himself says: "Either you're somebody, or you ain't nobody." Unfortunately for American Gangster, it ends up somewhere between the two.

770671119 <###> American Gangster <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Where it fails is in its sense of scale. It's definitely not an epic. And it's not a great film. But it's a good one.

It's a brooding, serious character study impersonating a crime thriller.
770671119 <###> American Gangster <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> American Gangster isn't bad or poorly-made or unsatisfactory; it's just good enough to make you painfully aware of all the ways it could have been better, too big and observed to watch as simple entertainment and too glossy and glib to watch as meaningful

312314416 <###> Rabid Dogs (Cani arrabbiati) (Kidnapped) ( A Man and a Boy) <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> As is often the case in the Bava-verse, Kidnapped turns out to be located at the intersection of every dime-paperback plot, in that wild space populated by crooks, vampires, astronauts, and cowboys, all tromping inexorably to The End.
312314416 <###> Rabid Dogs (Cani arrabbiati) (Kidnapped) ( A Man and a Boy) <###> Drama;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> Quite cynically, Bava evokes a human society where no one is to be trusted.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The film is so busy working hard to convict one rather shady character, it never convinces us of its own reason to exist.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.3 <###> The acting occasionally borders on great. The story itself is more than worthy. But none of that comes close to overcoming the misguided pacing and overall lack of depth.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> A somewhat flawed yet ultimately satisfying thriller.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> A story that's overloaded with research and unbridled speculation, all told with no clear direction.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> The end result is intriguing, with a dash of a love story here and a twisty whodunit there. A fine performance by Ryan Gosling glues the mishmash together.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> All Good Things isn't a pleasurable film to experience, but it offers an uncanny evocation of a narcissistic sociopath who doesn't come at us with the charm and sophistication that the typical screen bad guy has.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> All Good Things is a crackerjack crime thriller.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.3 <###> Ryan Gosling is sadly miscast as the villain in this poorly-written drama.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Jarecki never settles on what kind of story he wants to tell with these elements, and despite good performances, "All Good Things" veers awkwardly from love story to tragedy, from true-life mystery to black comedy.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> There's a fascinating story here for a bolder filmmaker, but after so much meandering it's a relief that All Good Things must come to an end.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> One can't help but think that veteran documentarian Jarecki chose to rework this material as drama to benefit his career, not the story. The result is a disjointed art film that opts for ambiguity over clarity...
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Jarecki knows how to make scenes of boisterous family reunions and quiet moments between lovers engaging: He fares less well, though, when the story takes a dark turn.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.84 <###> ...a movie suspended between bold novelistic invention and journalistic reserve. Be it demerit or credit, Jarecki is no Truman Capote and All Good Things is no In Cold Blood.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Dunst shines brightly and puts on an acting showcase worthy of awards recognition in the supporting actress category. The picture loses its luster when her character disappears.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> All Good Things is curiously underwhelming.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> While the acting is superb and the film worth viewing, in this odd straddle between fact and fiction, the filmmakers miss the chance to bring more fictive power to the tale.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.25 <###> a rather meticulously-detailed period piece that fails almost completely to offer up any human interest in its pursuit of human truth.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> It also feels like one man's attempt to try another in the court of cinema, or perhaps correct the course of justice itself.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.3 <###> Beset with a series of miscalculated dramatic misfires, the film is a melodramatic adaptation of a tabloid-style 20/20 murder-mystery, wearyingly overstuffed with baroque detail in an effort to prop up its legitimacy.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> In his first fictional feature, [Jarecki ] can't decide whether to opt for the open-ended inquiry of a non-fiction film or the resolved storytelling of Hollywood genre movie, so he winds up stranded in between.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The second half is at once unconventional and straightforward -- the former because of the actual content, the latter in terms of structure in which it's presented.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Gosling and co-stars Kirsten Dunst and Frank Langella don't do anything wrong here but the movie is such a mash-up of tones, fiction, and reality that it never comes together into anything coherent.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Kirsten Dunst is so good here as a woman at a loss to understand who her husband really is, and what the true nature of his family involves.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Too bad it's not a doc, which might have revealed the secrecy and confusion that led to such a legendary case remaining unsolved.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> You never feel you can trust that Jarecki knows what he's doing, which becomes even more problematic when the movie asks us to believe its theory about an unsolved crime.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> "All Good Things" has the eerie power of a nightmare.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> As excellent as Gosling is - and the actor conveys the stillness of the man as well as the voices screaming in his head - Dunst matches him stride for stride.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> It's a strange, thrilling tale begrimed by bad memories, by bad deeds.

770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Dunst is not the only person doing quality work in "All Good Things," but she is the only one worth watching.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> You watch it wanting to scurry off to read accounts of the real thing, rather than being caught up in the filmmaking.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> beneath the surface are all kinds of questions about power and wealth and the cyclical nature of familial tragedy, and while they break through from time to time, it is never enough to give the film more depth than a TrueTV documentary
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> As absorbing and detailed as "All Good Things" is, it never manages to levitate beyond tawdry movie-of-the-week voyeurism.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> All Good Things is a terrible miscalculation, one that should have been, given his history, glaringly obvious to its director. If this film had been made as a traditional documentary, this would likely be a very different review.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The performances offer much to admire, while the story fails to provide the chilling intensity it so clearly wants to generate.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> It's difficult, ultimately, to discern the point of the movie, other than to comment on how depressing and futile it all is.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Ambiguous, ineptly fictionalized psychological thriller that doesn't ring true, leaving the audience emotionally detached and disappointed.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It devolves into a misshapen flop with no shape to the narrative and no larger truths to be gained.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> ...queasy, claustrophobic mood
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Jarecki's telling of the Robert Durst story flails too far off course, too often, to retain the viewer's good faith.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.42 <###> There's plenty of information on what (might have) happened, but not much thought given to why.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.25 <###> ...a tedious, thoroughly pointless piece of work that boasts few attributes designed to capture the viewer's interest.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Jarecki, the wealthy co-founder of Moviefone who directed the acclaimed documentary "Capturing the Friedmans," here presents another memorable portrait of a dysfunctional family over three decades.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> The film ends up wrestling itself into a corner, though it's saved by a corrosive central performance from Ryan Gosling and a disconcertingly hypnotic feel.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Although the movie posits a solution to an infamous missing person's case, it does so in a manner that is less than satisfying.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> for all its strong performances and impressive style, no great effort can overcome a story so inextricably tethered to shapeless real-life conspiracy.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> All Good Things throws so many narrative balls in the air that you may struggle to catch up. It's worth the effort. Jarecki is a master of the telling detail.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Considering the facts of the still-unsolved Robert Durst case, this underwhelming docudrama from Andrew Jarecki should leave more of an impression.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> What we have here is a somewhat higher grade of a Lifetime true-crime picture.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> You go away slack-jawed with shock and sated with the chilling bedtime-story elements of a great unsolved mystery novel you can't put down.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> It's a juicy story, though that doesn't excuse Jarecki from fixating above all else on the tabloid-ready twists and pop-psychological turns of Durst's story.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> All Good Things is thoroughly engrossing, a roman a clef that chillingly ponders a puzzle and suggests solutions outlandish enough to be stranger than anything Hollywood, on its own, could make up.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It takes more than a little ambiguity and amateur-hour psychoanalysis to make Gosling's cipher the basis of an engaging screen drama.
770728354 <###> All Good Things <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A documentary on the same subject would have alleviated a lot of its problems. With someone of Andrew Jarecki's non-fiction background at the helm, it wouldn't have been tough to do&#151;or a bad idea.
770686747 <###> The Walking Dead <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> An admirable attempt, but these soldier's stories could be told a whole lot better.
771385238 <###> Entertainment <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> It conjures a menacing perspective on how the titular occupation hulls out empathy and cultivates a particularly unsettling strain of cynicism.

5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> At times this fanciful romp lurches uneasily between violence, slapstick comedy and sublime escapism - in other words, it's pure Gilliam.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The movie feels thoroughly like a project Gilliam did halfheartedly, just to stay in the game.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> A disjointed, ear-splitting, visually-jarring, mirthless exercise in pandemonium that director Terry Gilliam tries to pass off as family entertainment.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> It's a slog, an out-of-control fantasy that's strangely unenchanting and, in the end, rather tiresome.

5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> There is much in this film to admire, but it goes by too fast and the story is almost incomprehensible. There is certainly enchantment here, but the story does not do much to hold it together.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The movie is at least twice as good as most people say it is and about half as good as we'd all hoped it would be.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Perfect family entertainment and undoubtedly well worth seeing, but somewhat of a let down.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> ... on the whole, The Brothers Grimm is a mess ...
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The Brothers Grimm has its moments, but it's ultimately a very flawed film and capsizes under the weight of some hammy performances and a poorly-conceived script.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Gilliam has a history of blaming studios when his films go wrong. But he has no one to blame but himself for this poisoned apple.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Perfect material, you might think, for Terry Gilliam's brain of perpetual invention. But despite occasional flashes of dark genius, he hasn't laid a golden egg.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> I wish the plot were pared down, that the magic used more sparingly. But new movies offer us so little, it seems daffy to complain that this one gives us too much.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Em varios momentos, Gilliam parece se preocupar mais com o efeito do que com a eficacia de sua historia.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Inconsistent and painfully rote.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Surprisingly dull and uninvolving.

5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> In refusing easy categorization, the film at least flirts with greatness, and occasionally achieves it.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Atmosphere alone doesn't make a movie
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's ironic that a movie whose central characters are two of the world's greatest storytellers should be so careless in telling its own story.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> a film overflowing with cool sets and special effects, yet it's also rather emotionally unengaging, something that has plagued Gilliam all throughout his career.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Terry Gilliam is as unable to make an uninteresting movie as he is unable to make a "commercial" film...[but this] feels the most commercial and least Gilliamesque to me.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Kruger may put in his best script, but Gilliam does everything in his power to demystify it with wackiness!

5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Maybe they should have cast Affleck with Damon and called it "Bad Grimm Haunting"
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Brazil fans are likely to return from this not-so-enchanted forest disillusioned, sustained only by the scattered breadcrumbs of Gilliam's genius....
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The Brothers Grimm is numbingly grim even for him, Terry Gilliam. ... Sometimes outlandish and quirky just isn't enough, even by rebel-filmmaker standards.

5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> would be too easy to make a pun out of the title "The Brothers Grimm," because its a fair description of the atmosphere of the film itself.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Gilliam is still a visual showman, a childish tease and an artist with an imagination too big for cinema.

5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> In the midst of all this pandemonium, moments of Gilliam's awe-inspiring vision swirl around like the black crows and dead leaves that pepper the film's woodsy fabric.

5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> A third class theme park ride, much too dark for children, too familiar for adults, and too lame for either.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Gilliam fans will recognize their boy has been restricted again from crafting the all-out vision they know he's capable of

5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Frankly I never would have believed that Terry Gilliam had a movie this bad in him.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Just because it's accessible doesn't mean it's not clearly Gilliam.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> For grown-ups who pretend they don't believe the horrible stories they heard as children.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> It probably had extravaganza status in mind at the outset, but it may have to settle with fun fantasy curiosity.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> If you are a long lost relative of the Grimm family, I encourage you to sue because Terry Gilliam has left a stain on your family's name that can't be erased with OxyClean.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Director Terry Gilliam hasn't made a movie this playful since his Monty Python days, scattering visual and verbal puns throughout Grimm like Hansel and Gretel scatter breadcrumbs.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> If The Brothers Grimm flies apart like a badly designed airplane (and it does), it still has more going for it than most of the movie fare this summer.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Despite a few early sparks of promise, The Brothers Grimm sputters and coughs along like an unoiled machine, grinding gears and nerves in equal measure.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Although Gilliam does bend The Brothers Grimm to his surreal and absurdist will, watching it is little like searching for pearls in pig flop.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Although Gilliam has always had a taste for the outre, he has allowed it to get out of hand here and swallow the picture whole.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There is magic in The Brothers Grimm but it's hard to locate amid all the ... 'stuff,' I believe is the technical phrase.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Easy to recommend but hard to love, distinguished by Gilliam's extravagant and funny style, but compromised by creative warfare and budgetary limitations.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It's a muddle, but it's a Terry Gilliam muddle -- and there's nothing like his muddles anywhere in our uptight, color-within-the-lines mainstream.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It's obvious Gilliam was reigned in a tad...perhaps the big-bad studio had a bit of fear and loathing...
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The Brothers Grimm is a work of limitless invention, but it is invention without pattern, chasing itself around the screen without finding a plot.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> `The Brothers Grimm' isn't for children but for adults who want to relive the bedroom tales of their childhood.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The movie makes you yearn for the innocent times that Junior learned about kinky sex from playground stories or late-night Cinemax rather than summer kids' flicks.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It might be Gilliam's worst movie, but it's still okay.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Gilliam's film is trapped somewhere between fable and comedy. It's as if he is so entranced by his own visual inventiveness that he completely loses sight of his storytelling.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A movie with a Terry Gilliam look and feel but without a Terry Gilliam soul. (The director) seems to have had his spirit broken by studio mandates and commercial constraints.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> A film with all the drama and flair of a Tuesday Morning tchotchke shop.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A departure into more mainstream territory for Gilliam, but maintains the dark humor and wonder that his fans expect
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> In keeping with the actual Grimm fables, as they were originally published before whitewashing took place, this movie has a lot of horror in it.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> [O]ffers us a glimpse at a future where one of our most idiosyncratic directors has been beaten down by the corporate system. Now that's the making of a Terry Gilliam movie.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Gilliam transmutes familiar fairy tales . . . into something that is distinctly his own [with] absurdist humor and more than a little social commentary
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Surely the brothers Grimm are deserving of a real biopic. This is not just too phantasmagorical to be entertainment, it's incoherent,...an opportunity lost.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Fails to reinvent its Grimm yarns and only cursorily investigates the relationship between truth and fiction as it rumbles from one farcical scenario to another.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's been 7 years since Gilliam's last film. It was not worth the wait.

5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It's Gilliam's chance to run amok, and watching him do it is eye-popping fun.
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Who knew child abuse could be so entertaining?
5616 <###> The Brothers Grimm <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Gilliam is a film artist with a grand and copious vision that he incorporates into every frame of every film like a potion.
17255 <###> Swimming To Cambodia <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> Gray pulls together genocide, pleasure-seeking, military paranoia, filmmaking, and even an anecdote about rude neighbors to paint a coherent portrait of aggression.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> A cartoony and messy narrative that is mostly style over substance.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> "Killer Elite" came close to earning a recommendation, but because of the problems with the script and a bit of a drawn-out storyline, it didn't quite get there.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> The Killer Elite is a flabby, cheap looking, mess that has a saving grace in the performance of Deniro.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> McKendry doesn't pull off either the action nor the drama to any satisfaction.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> While it promised to rock us like a hurricane, Killer Elite instead bores us with action movie cliches aplenty and uninspired action sequences.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Far more than just another Transporter clone, and far less than the sum of its parts, the result is an oddity you couldn't make up.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Stale and bland, Killer Elite is an emotionless, assembly-line actioner with little to keep even the hardest of hardcore fans interested.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> ...an uncompromising, better-than-average actioner that gets the job done on an impressively consistent basis.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.3 <###> a theatrical release with the star power behind this movie should have delivered something much better
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Even die-hard De Niro fans may be disappointed in his choice this time around. 'Killer Elite' does indeed present an ensemble of terrific actors trying to kill each other. Problem is, this adds up to a serviceable actioner but nothing more.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> [Jason Statham] may be going the way of Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Gary McKendry's 1980s period piece is admirably hard-nosed, but hamstrung by its rather routine action sequences and its utterly cliched 'meaningful' dialogue ('Killing isn't hard. Living with it is,' intones Statham).
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.3 <###> Can't even manage the not-terribly-artful task of being a good "Jason Statham growls and beats people up" picture.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> I don't know which is more risible: Clive Owen's mustache, which would have been the envy of any 70s-era porn star, or the fact that someone as tough and charismatic as Owen could possibly be saddled with the name Spike.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> The overlong, perfunctory Killer Elite is simply a series of (reasonably well-choreographed) assassination sequences.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> I had a perfectly fine time watching the movie and the antics of its three stars.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> The big stunts and action sequences simply dull the brain and the Oman angle is lost inside a scarcely-fathomable plot.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Long, muddled, misguided.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Jason Statham delivers the action as usual but this time he has the support of Owen and De Niro.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> A few good stunts, some tolerable brooding and one nice, if silly desert chase. But not essential.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> A solid, but mostly forgettable, thriller that has an intriguing plot and solid cast going for it, but isn't particularly well-made.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> the audience learns that Jason Statham, tied to a chair and unarmed, is more dangerous than men who are both armed and unfettered. Moments like that of pure physicality are too few and too far between
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Fast-paced and disposable. For action fans, that will be plenty. For those wanting more, look elsewhere.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> If you're a fan of Statham or Owen, you will enjoy the action, but what could have been a classic and the start to a franchise, is instead just another guys and guns movie.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Claims to recount true events but is frankly very hard to believe.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> "Killer Elite" sticks to the ribs when it sticks to simple skullduggery and Stathamian standards of busting heads. Whenever it strives for warrior poetry, it's more like a Nantucket-esque limerick scribbled in a London pub's bathroom.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.3 <###> Pockets of really interesting action in a sea of tedious exposition.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> It's an uneven mix, though it still delivers in fits and starts.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> The permanently scowling Statham borders on caricature, while the talents of De Niro and Owen are completely wasted.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.9 <###> Jason Statham cements status as top-level action star.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Ask yourself: Would The Parallax View and Three Days of the Condor be better with scissor kicks? Are The Conversation and Marathon Man a few dislocated bones short of greatness? Even if you answered yes, you should lower your expectations.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Killer Elite is a throwback to an era when action movies still had balls, when muscular bravado easily overcame banal screenwriting and corny narrative earnestness.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Despite the presence of some notable acting talent, this not-Elite work turns out to be just another dumb Jason Statham film.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> The picture entertains, at times legitimately and at others in a cheesy, '80s action sort of way
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.35 <###> Jason Statham is enjoyable enough to watch that he can occasionally make one forget just how silly and dull a movie like Killer Elite really is.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> Features characters less three-dimensional than most cartoons doing and saying things that are only done and said in movies. Bad movies. Really bad movies.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> First time director Gary McKendry adopts a gritty visual style and puts together a solid direct-to-dvd offering that wouldn't have likely seen a theatrical release but for its impressive cast.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> While the film has decent action sequences, the film is overly convoluted and very hard to follow at times. Wait for the rental!
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> The movie's not stupid. And that makes it more than bearable and often a little fun.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> This is the kind of clunky, badly-written action thriller that you would expect to head straight to DVD.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Have fun, action junkies.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> The only remotely surprising thing about the new thriller Killer Elite is just how resoundingly unsurprising the entire enterprise is and as it plods on and on.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Though the film tries to achieve Bourne-style grit and depth, it lacks the intelligence and flair that made the Matt Damon franchise so compelling.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> To be sure, first-time director Gary McKendry keeps things moving at an adrenalized pace, even through thickets of flashbacks. But this is precisely Killer Elite's major problem: motion at the expense of emotion.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> The plot is over-complicated, the screenplay limp and some of the subsidiary acting is hardly up to the mark.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> When Robert De Niro, Clive Owen and Jason Statham unite for an action thriller, we should be able to expect something special. Or at least memorable. Instead, "Killer Elite" gives us ordinary.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> It doesn't care if you like it, which is why I kind of do.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.25 <###> I'll admit that nobody goes to a Statham movie hoping the script will be erudite, but could it at least make a little bit of sense?
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> Simultaneously silly and overwrought...
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> Clumsily directed by Gary McKendry and poorly written by Matt Sherring, rookies both, the convoluted movie collapses under the weight of its own cliches.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> There is so much testosterone in this movie, women walk into the theater looking like Taylor Swift, but they walk out looking like Chaz Bono.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.25 <###> A mess from the bottom up.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Killer Elite had potential to be a really interesting, action-heavy political thriller. Sadly, it never really tries to be anything more than another vehicle for Jason Statham.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.25 <###> It's not about aesthetics, and it's certainly not about people, so the film settles on a lot of chaos and whirring bullets. "Killer Elite" is a waste of time and resources.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Comes with enough geezahs!, shootahs! and mouthy nonces! to make the forthcoming Sweeney remake look positively redundant.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> [A] pileup of sub-Bourne action set pieces, sad laughs and cliches.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.3 <###> Killer Elite has plenty of killing, but the only thing elite about it is the cast.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.25 <###> With a B+ cast and a script full of pseudo-profound moral complexities, its aspirations are lofty and its achievements are trifling.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Jason Statham is matched with Robert de Niro and Clive Owen in this headcracking hitman yarn, but it's a bit overcomplicated for its own good.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> much of Killer Elite is flummoxed by its own make-up
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> If you want some meaning with your mayhem, or even a good line of dialogue or two, look elsewhere.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Gary McKendry hadn't directed a feature before this one, and you feel it. Any scene that fails to involve the revving of motors or the breaking of bones is dead.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> The big names are all present ... but all within an overly complex, erratic thriller framework that has moments of viable tension, but others of dramatic silliness.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> The fun of Killer Elite, such as it is, is all in the hardass action. But there's nothing elite about this disposable time-killer.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> An uneasy mix of hard-charging action and high-minded 'true story' drama
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> It's an analog thriller that benefits from refreshing injections of low-tech adrenaline.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> This mucho macho testosterone-propelled action thriller is undermined by its formulaic execution.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.55 <###> Rote and joyless, an exercise in disposability.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Despite having a perfect cast for a title like Killer Elite, Gary McKendry's feature debut comes across as little more than a generic Jason Statham movie with two high-profile guest stars.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> The script is a mess.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Killer Elite is too formulaic to overcome a been-there, done-that feel.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> This is actually a pretty good thriller, based more on character and plot than on action for its own sake.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> The movie opens with text telling us that 'The world is in chaos,' which is so helpful ... all of the gunfire and violent revenge would have suggested that everyone's hunky dory.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Gary McEndry's espionage thriller isn't bad, but it isn't Peckinpah; all the two films have in common are the title and lots of shooting.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> And quite the cliche-ridden desultory mess it is, too...
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Clive Owen, as a toneless bad guy in a mindless thriller, has found his natural home.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> If you're willing to accept "Killer Elite" as a shoot-'em-up action movie with good actors taking the spots of the usual lunk heads (but spouting the usual nonsense), you'll be pleased with the film.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> A decent yarn, decently told, a tough guy film built around veteran screen tough guys.
771244758 <###> Killer Elite <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> When Statham and Owen finally meet in the showdown you've been waiting for, it's rendered in such dizzying, adrenalized style that it's hard to tell who's doing what to whom.

770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Never comes close to captivating its audience like the game did before it.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> The willfully absurd action sequences help the movie slog along, but slog it does, right through to the obligatory after-credits scene to establish the possibility of a franchise.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Based on a Finnish shoot-em up video game, Max Payne is all style and little story, cheerless detective Max (Mark Wahlberg) drifting through a washed out and snowy New York in search of his wife's killer.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> A detective story, a pharmaceutical miracle drug and winged creatures from some demonic dimension sprouting like weeds in the spring. Too much and too artificial.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> Imagine The Constant Gardener after a frontal lobotomy, and that's basically Max Payne in a nutshell.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> This tired, neutered action thriller won't cause you max pain, but you might wince every now and again.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.333333333333 <###> John Moore directs the hell out of the action, while Jonathan Sela's glistening photography captures the snow and rain that fall on these bloody New York streets. But you'd have to be on crack not to guess the 'surprise' finale.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Among the best films adapted from videogames. Say no more.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Mark Wahlberg's titular hero hasn't cracked a smile in seven years. The surprise is that he makes the lonely cop seem half human with half a dozen words and a staggering amount of violence.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> The film combines ferocious self-importance with lashings of really nasty, unreflective violence.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> A massive waste of time and a glaring missed opportunity.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Max Payne? Maximum Payne in the butt more like.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> The occasional muzzle-flare of stylish violence, but that's it. Dull, depressing and dragging its knuckles at 100 minutes, Max Payne misfires and Wahlberg's leading-man jinx continues.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> No high-octane, fast-paced shoot 'em up this, Max Payne may well be the most tedious trip to a cinema you make all year. Truly, the minutes pass like hours. It's akin to one of those straight-to-DVD titles you only ever find in petrol stations.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> It would be far too easy to say that max pain sums up Mark Wahlberg's latest lead role.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> This tired, neutered action thriller won't cause you max pain, but you might wince every now and again.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> If you can follow the plotlines of this swingeing approximation of the well-known video game of the same name, you are a better customer for John Moore's spectacular thriller than I was.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> Badly written, poorly acted and surprisingly dull action thriller that substitutes loud gunfire for thrills and doesn't bother to develop the characters beyond their video game origins.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> Loud and completely devoid of wit or interest, this empty-headed action movie looks terrific thanks to its big budget and heavily stylised visuals. But it's impossible to care about anything that happens.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Mark Wahlberg shifts the dank micro-climate that is his charisma to Max Payne, a "neo noir" action thriller which means it snows a lot in murky New York.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> The moment of the film when you should be going "oh my god I can't believe it," you're thinking, "I wonder if we could sneak into the end of Beverly Hills Chihuahua."

770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Elegaic where it should be electrifying, dundering where it should be sharp, Payne is lovely to look at and that's about it
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> This trashy film is a case of big guns and small brains.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> As revenge films go, 'Max Payne' is a little less than average.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Max Payne is a junkyard dog of a film that is true to its video-game roots even as it transcends them.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> ...even less of a story than the videogame on which it is based...
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> Much happens -- some of it incomprehensible, most of it pointlessly preposterous and all of it slightly less involving than watching algae grow on a stagnant pond.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> A thrill-less video game adaptation.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Watching Max Payne is painful to the max.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> I am still a big Mark Wahlberg fan but his choice of roles is beginning to try my patience
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Every shot, every edit is well thought out. But in the end, I didn't care about anyone.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> Your quintessential guy film. If you have any significant level of testosterone in your blood stream, you'll find something to enjoy about it.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Simple, it is as by-the-books formulaic as can be, and there's not a surprise around that the corner that isn't obvious immediately.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Max Payne starts out promising but eventually begins to unravel, only to end in an awful mess.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> The filmmakers aim their cynicism more at us than at any government or drug company.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> It snows one day in Max Payne, rains like crazy the next, and then it snows again. But any way you slice it, the movie's all wet.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> Video game adaptation is bloody but boring.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> That the freaky angels all over the ads aren't even real is akin to if audiences had flocked to see Jurassic Park back in 1993 and discovered that the dinosaurs only appeared in a couple brief dream sequences.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> There were moments that needed some explanation and characters that needed a quite a bit of fleshing out. But it was violent and fun and since that's why I played the game, I left the theater satisfied.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> I don't have a problem with brainless entertainment playing it safe and overloading on cliches but Max Payne makes the fatal mistake of being cliched and boring.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> You can't help but wonder where the fine actor in The Departed and even Invincible has gone. It's not been a good year for Wahlberg: First The Happening, and now this.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> Maybe somebody decided the movie was already so convoluted and leaden that throwing in a few swooping, screeching valkyries could only help. They do not.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> A movie that cares much more for poetic choreography in explosive gunfights than gaping lapses of logic in a flimsy crime narrative.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> There are several old adages actors should follow when considering a film role: never work with children, cute barnyard animals or do movie adaptations of video games.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> Max just drags on as it drags you down. If you stay and watch the endless end credits, there's a short scene that hints a sequel is coming. That's what I call real pain.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Maybe fans of the game will be okay with the cinematic adaptation but for those who aren't new to Max and his world, this isn't an impressive introduction. Clunky action, chaotic plotting, and embarrassing dialogue are not ways to impress newcomers.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Mark Wahlberg, who has proved himself a very capable actor, seems to have nominated himself for the Russell Crowe Lack of Charisma Award, and is running a pretty convincing campaign.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> A weak little sister to Sin City.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> No amount of generosity could excuse the levels of ineptitude on display here.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> Dark, moody, extremely twisted and hard to enjoy on any level.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> Miserable, in every sense of the word.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> Director John Moore pays homage to the video game by pushing the slo-mo button during action sequences in a fashion that would make John Woo weep tears of sorrow. He's not the only one.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> It's stylishly directed by John Moore, and his actors don't embarrass themselves, despite the iffy premise.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> Let's hope next time they get a literate script, an engaging plot, a better-suited supporting cast and a more restrained director.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Max Payne, game or movie, has precious little to say.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The few thrills it does have are outweighed by its rather dumb plotting and an overly familiar sense of style.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Give 'Max Payne' the modest credit it deserves. It's a gloriously dumb, over-the-top slice of convoluted pulp fiction, and far more entertaining than I would have expected.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> Honestly, you find yourself rooting against Payne's survival, even with a good actor in the hollow role. There's nothing inside the film's sour, slovenly spirit of vengeance.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Andy Samberg's imitation of Marky Mark as Barky Bark is vastly more amusing than Wahlberg's latest action vehicle.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Eventually, Max pieces together a conspiracy, but Max Payne spells it all out so obviously that the densest audience members will put the pieces together at least half an hour before the hero finally does.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.125 <###> Simply terrible. An insult to gamers and action fans. Frankly, it doesn't even deserve notoriety as one of the year's worst; it deserves to be forgotten.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> The film should have been about Payne getting addicted to drugs, having a good heart, but doing really bad things to search for the man who murdered his family--not this mess.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Wahlberg packs the talent to add depth to most roles. In this one, though, he does little more than mope around and blast away (video-game style) in this barrage of rapid fire.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> This intense action thriller will be recalled for its exciting visuals and relentless action rather than its acting.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Though the film's action scenes won't win awards for originality, they can't be faulted for either their scale or love of slo-mo.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Visually compelling and with a cast willing to make the effort so that we'll take it seriously, this is a solid action film.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> An embarrassment to a genre that's already delivered some of the worst movies of the last ten years.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Though the PG-13 rating of Max Payne limited the amount of violence, the film still succeeds mainly due to the dark, gritty and beautiful cinematography.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Max Payne is content to be an efficient vehicle for the delivery of a familiar range of sensations, some of which almost rise to the level of feelings.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> A critic can stay alert through movies that would put elephants into comas, but I doubt most people will stay awake for Max Payne.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> It is stylish, slick, loud and empty as the producers wanted it to be.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.0 <###> Did Wahlberg read the script, or was it hidden under the pile of money that the producers dropped at his door step?"
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The movie's excellent design and mood almost -- almost -- outweigh the stupid story.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Max Payne joins Fox's steadily increasing roster of entirely ineffective action pictures, alongside such underwhelming disappointments as Hitman and Live Free or Die Hard...
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> nothing we haven't seen before
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> A big nothing, not even hokey enough to watch for the sake of laughing at it.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> This action saga is driven into unintentionally self-parodic territory only a seven-year-old boy could reasonably stomach.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Unable to really turn chilly menace into tough, action-packed fun.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> As good as a couple of its action beats are, Max still suffers from the heartlessness that makes games emotionally inferior to movies. Nobody ever shed a tear over a video-game character's death.
770706171 <###> Max Payne <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The story, involving conspiracies, doesn't always make sense. And the surprises are easy to predict; director John Moore doesn't try to hide them.
395115063 <###> Tough Guys Don't Dance <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> A juicy cult classic.
395115063 <###> Tough Guys Don't Dance <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Strange and self-indulgent, but oddly entertaining.
395115063 <###> Tough Guys Don't Dance <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.2 <###> Ponderous and absurd, like the novel. As a stand-in for Mailer, O'Neal is limp.
395115063 <###> Tough Guys Don't Dance <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Not the high point of the Mailer career, but it's a small, entertaining part of it.
395115063 <###> Tough Guys Don't Dance <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> It's a mystery, and not an overly compelling one.
395115063 <###> Tough Guys Don't Dance <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> What is strange is that Tough Guys Don't Dance leaves me with such vivid memories of its times and places, its feelings and weathers, and yet leaves me so completely indifferent to its plot. Watching the film, I laughed a good deal.

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> I know someone out there must like these things, because Sandler keeps getting the money to make what is turning out to be the same movie over and over again, but I must not be tuned into his comedy wavelength.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> The idea that the unholy trinity of Sandler, regular cohort Rob Schneider, and director Dennis Dugan could re-unite after ...Chuck and Larry begs the question: just how much did these guys sell their souls to get another film green lit?

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> You have to give Adam Sandler some credit: He is trying new things and working to expand his particular brand of juvenile comedy, albeit not always successfully.

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Slightly better than most.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> An army hero wearing Mariah Carey t-shirts? Yes. Yes. Yes.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Sandler prefers to fall back on cartoonish stunt action, sleazy innuendo and bodily fluid gags. These things may satisfy his core fan-base, but everyone else will leave the cinema feeling a bit cheated.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> The worst thing about the film is not that but the constant, feeble sexual innuendos with which Sandler saddles himself.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine isn't exactly the obvious choice of topic for a comedy - which is perhaps why this film is about as funny as a suicide bombing.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The central character may be a spin on Borat, and many of the jokes a touch familiar, but the whole package is so unbelievably silly, you'll find yourself laughing for at least half the running time.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> By the end, I felt as though I had been carpet-bombed by comedy's answer to Vladimir Putin. But, on second thoughts, Putin is funnier.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There are enough comedy diamonds in the rough here though to make it worth a look, but only just.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> After playing it relatively straight in his recent movies, Adam Sandler goofs off big time here, laying on a thick Israeli accent and proving real men blow dry. There are funny highpoints, but the grab-bag approach never quite gels.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> While the premise may not stand up to scrutiny, Sandler's performance - relatively restrained and nicely judged - makes you almost warm to the man who dumbly shrugged his way through years of neo-com tat.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> This is a silly, crass comedy about a badass Israeli commando who secretly longs to be a hairdresser specialising in 1980s stylings.

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> There's a broad theory that no matter how funny the comedy, 90 minutes is the point at which audiences have had enough. You Don't Mess With The Zohan trundles on for 113 minutes, none of them funny.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.333333333333 <###> Another sloppily concocted and naggingly non-controversial pretext for Sandler to pelvic thrust his way though a succession of increasingly wacky fish-out-of-water situations.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A strange, mostly enjoyable mix of big political questions and crude comedy, Zohan overcomes its skeletal plotting and uneven gag ratio through Sandler's sheer commitment to nonsense.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> O pior filme da carreira de Adam Sandler... e se considerarmos que estamos falando do genio por tras de O Paizao e Little Nicky, esta constatacao se torna mais do que deprimente; torna-se apavorante.

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Just when you think civilisation may be moving forward a bit (OK, I'm an optimist), another Adam Sandler movie comes along.

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Occasionally the film is so bad it's almost funny, if you think a scene in which a cat is used as a football is funny.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Why does Adam Sandler continue to make these comedies that aren't funny? Because your neighbor's 13-year old kid keeps going to see them.

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> The script has a couple of actually funny gags, but hack director Dennis Dugan messes up the delivery in service to Sandler's titanic ego.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> If "Munich" is the disease, the Zohan is the cure. Some hard little grains of truth make this Sandler's funniest movie since "The Waterboy."
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Things work out, of course, to everyone's satisfaction: there are a few political gags that have a veneer of audacity, but in essence, the movie takes risks only with its audience's gag reflex.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> If only the Zohan hadn't messed with us. Worse than his excruciating Chuck And Larry, Sandler seems determined to refine the unfunny comedy. Please, Mr Sandler, stop it. Please. It hurts.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Director Duggan serves up a scattershot satire that is about as funny as a Palestinian landmine at an Israeli kiddie birthday party. Broad, offensive and thinly veiled...

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> When it's funny, it's very, very funny, but when it's bad, it's downright awful.

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> despite all of the film's problems, there are still plenty of very funny moments and Zohan is one of Sandler's more enjoyable characters.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> When I think of movies that have a locker-room mentality I think of movies like this one, another sleazy, dirty-minded offering from Adam Sandler.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There are really only four jokes in the movie, and each of them goes from being pleasantly goofy to positively leaden as the film's needlessly protracted running time unspools.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> "Zohan's" first hour may well be the strongest stretch of any Sandler comedy. But, in its second half, the film's humor takes a backseat in favor of a heavy-handed plea for Mideast peace. A noble goal, of course, but not a very funny one.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Isn't all that different from any number of old Adam Sandler pictures. That's to say that it's not very good, and you probably won't find it terribly funny.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan tries to mix high-brow satire with low-brow gross-out humor. The combination kills the story's pacing.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The movie has surprisingly little energy. Sandler seems to think all he needs to do is talk in a phony middle-eastern accent to generate laughs, but what he's saying should also be funny too, right?
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> The Zohan is a mess

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> Judd Apatow continues his quest to kill comedy with coarse, low class, low-intellect rubbish like this, which can turn you mind to porridge if you sit through it.

But what redeems the film to some degree is its general good naturedness...
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> opens with a close-up of [Zohan's] bulging crotch and remains in that territory, in every sense, for the 113 minutes that it violates the screen

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> This is one of those movie ideas that leaves you wondering what other ideas, exactly, were rejected in favor of this one, on the grounds of being too lame.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Cutting to celeb cameos as often as locks of hair fall to the floor of a Supercuts doesn't create comedy -- no more than sticking a person's head in a salon sink means it can wash/cut/style itself.el=1010828&title=Screen Savor Movie Review%3A You Don%27t
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> In the relatively anemic anthology of recent Adam Sandler flops, You Don't Mess with the Zohan hangs above with comedic charm and a nonsensically amusing plotline. Sandler is the white version of the legendary Tim Meadows character The Ladies Man.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> A 2-hour opus of sex, sex, sex, sex, sex and more sex. Even drunken frat boys will be screaming, "Enough already, we get it!"

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> If one-note jokes that drag on too long or are worked into the ground aren't enough to trigger comic nausea, then perhaps the myriad uses of hummus will do the trick in You Don't Mess With the Zohan.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Zoolander and the Austin Powers films are essentially one-joke comedies, but the basic joke is funny.

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There's a lot to be said for consumerism as a salve for historic wounds. Of course, there's also a drawback to our free market ways -- we get shoes made in China and movies like You Don't Mess with the Zohan.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The movie may not win Sandler many new fans, but it's a baby step toward making comedies with a bit more substance than, say, The Waterboy.

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Sandler and his crew -- Judd Apatow was a credited writer -- can't take this movie marriage of ambition and apathy down the aisle.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The direction by Dennis Dugan is flabby and dull -- like most of the hacks-for-hire who end up bringing a Sandler opus to the screen, and whose chief qualification seems to be the ability to shout 'Great, Adam! Great!'
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> How much you like this will depend upon your appreciation for repeated jokes about hummus, gays, Zohan's crotch and his fondness for older women.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> His humor works best when it's throw-away, but Zohan throws everything up to get a yuck. It's a shock to see how many 'yuck!' moments Sandler settles for.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> You Don't Mess with the Zohan is the best Adam Sandler comedy in ages - but for only the film's first 20 minutes.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Zohan tries for a message of social relevance with a nod to America as the land of multicultural coexistence, but its real value is in air-fluffing our cares away for a couple of hours.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Essentially, You Don't Mess With the Zohan isn't all that different in tone and sensibility from Sandler's previous films, but he's really trying in this one, and the effort pays off.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Zohan skirts any real issues, but maybe crass and messy is more reflective of the times and situation.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's at its best when Adam Sandler is catching fish with his buttocks, just like most of his movies.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> This collision of sensibilities may be funnier than much of Sandler's recent repertoire, but it's also a clumsy, scattershot fiasco that's more likely to offend those with astute comedic taste than anyone on either side of the Israeli-Palestine equation.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Evidently there's something even harder to pull off than Middle Eastern peace: a steady run of jokes that deserve our laughter -- if You Don't Mess With the Zohan is an indicator.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The Zohan could have worked significantly better if it was delivered in smaller doses, like say a reoccurring skit on "Saturday Night Live," but at 113 minutes the movie wears out its welcome long before the closing credits hit the screen.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Sandler works so hard at this, and so shamelessly, that he battered down my resistance.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> True Sandler fans will want to know only where Zohan stands on the A.S. scale, with Happy Gilmore at the top and Little Nicky at the bottom. I'd put it closer to the latter than the former.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> If You Don't Mess With the Zohan isn't the bravest movie ever made about current Arab-Israeli relations, it's at least the bravest movie ever made about current Arab-Israeli relations featuring a former Mossad agent who shags Lainie Kazan.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Any positive messages are practically drowned out by the film's relentless crude humor, much of which is too dumb to be all that funny.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> It's painfully unfunny and cumbersome for extended stretches, necessitating bizarre story detours to jumpstart jokes that, though funny, often seem completely misplaced.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The notion that both sides are equally responsible for the intentional killing of civilians requires total ignorance of what's actually transpiring in the region.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan contains an important, if simplified, argument that is totally lost beneath a dozen hummus jokes too many.

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Mess with The Zohan if you like, but be prepared for the consequences.

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Given the missed opportunities for sharpening silliness with satire, it's impossible not to mess with the Zohan.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> From the wholly insular and yet perfectly realized fantasy world it creates to the nonstop barrage of ethnic slams, You Don't Mess with the Zohan is a comedy of contradictions..

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> The movie paints crude and insulting portraits of Israelis and Palestinians, going in for the basest stereotypes that would only bring a smile to the face of a Klansman.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> he film might be rated PG-13, but with this sort of verbal wit, it appears to be aimed at first-graders.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> Let's not mince words here, or hem and haw and add caveats about a few laughs or good intentions: You Don't Mess With the Zohan is astonishingly, impressively, depressingly bad.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Any hopes of it actually transforming into a dark and corrosive satire are pretty much dissipated in the first few minutes when we get inexplicable close-ups of our hero catching both a Hacky Sack and an entire barbecued fish between his butt cheeks.

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> More annoying than the crassness, really, is the directorial sloppiness &#8212; which results in a virtually mirthless first half-hour.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> While Zohan purveys the familiar Sandler mix of Jewvenile humor and geriatric love, it's less about a manic manchild than it is a raunchily wholesome message movie that deploys stereotypes in order to smash them.
770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Sandler has shown some spark in more dramatic roles, so it's disappointing to see him return to his one-note 'form.'

770671938 <###> You Don't Mess With the Zohan <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Zohan is, against all odds, Sandler's funniest effort in close to a decade. Not exactly a monumental feat given the junk he's recently made a mint foisting on the American public, but still.

10704 <###> Days of Thunder <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> This is the kind of monstrously overgrown commercial movie that depends entirely on the microscopic pleasures of having one`s most routine expectations fulfilled.
10704 <###> Days of Thunder <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Not only does Days of Thunder disappoint on the basic narrative level, it is also a peculiarly thrill-less action movie.

10704 <###> Days of Thunder <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Days of Thunder does accomplish the job it sets out to do.

771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> When Jason Statham stops to pat a kitten after MacGyvering up the bad guy's meth-lab to explode when the lights are switched on, you will either groan or giggle... if you are inclined towards the latter you may find quite a bit of enjoyment in Homefront.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The climax is a muddle and borderline preachy

771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> This unlikely teaming of Jason Statham and James Franco proves to be a clever blend of action and acting.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Just what you expect in a Jason Statham movie - and that is action from beginning to end.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> The plot is too foreordained in every detail to be genuinely gripping, and the action far too shoddy in both conception and execution, which is even worse.

771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Jason Statham is at it again. He is proving to be this decades ultimate action star.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Skull-cracking and stylistic, it's a ferocious, profanity-filled revenge flick that should have gone direct-to-video.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Statham displays a tender side rarely seen in his previous action work, and Franco adds another memorably sleazy maverick to his CV.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> A maniacally muddled and maudlin thriller, co-written and produced by Sly Stallone.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> With a powerhouse cast and an anaemic script, this violent revenge thriller never quite gets off the ground.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Statham is not the English Clint Eastwood yet, but if someone fancied calling him Dirty Jason... who knows?
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Much like Stallone's Expendables entries, Homefront's premise is more appetising on paper than it is in execution.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Homefront never quite reaches a level when it becomes more than just an enjoyable Statham actioner, but watching an enjoyable Statham actioner isn't a bad way to spend a couple hours.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Nobody would know what Sylvester Stallone fans want from a Stallone action movie better than Sly himself.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Fleder - a dab hand with knotty, workable pulp - proves admirably patient in revealing character and place, and it helps that those laying siege to our hero's self-timbered abode never quite react in the way expected of goons in a Jason Statham movie.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Statham is on auto-pilot throughout and it suffers from an underwritten plot and lacklustre action sequences.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Homefront does nothing to stretch its leading man, but there's something to be said for Statham's stardom and the films being slotted around it - like a stubborn bollard, you always know exactly where to find him.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Homefront is only really compelling when it's exploring the hassles and complexities of being an overwhelmed small-time meth dealer, or when it makes good use of the local color of its backwoods Louisiana setting.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Although Franco's clearly enjoying himself, and Statham smashes faces with finesse, two warring films emerge, neither of them particularly convincing.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Nobody can write this stuff like Stallone and nobody can play it like Statham.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> [Statham's] fans will no doubt have a blast. And this time it's highly likely that everyone else will too.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> 'Homefront' just isn't the Southern-fried smackdown it should have been
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Another shake-and-bake Stath special, boasting the requisite punchy-fighty action and some pleasing sleaziness from Franco and Bosworth, but it's ponderously handled by director Fleder.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> While it may not be anything you need to rush out to the theaters to see, "Homefront" is a solid action film that, thanks to the talents of Statham, can venture into a more dramatic side other kick-ass movies have to stay away from.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.62 <###> A solid action film that simultaneously reminds us of those fun 1990's martial arts stars and displays the acting ability they never had.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> It's not that a stereotypical Jason Statham movie is a bad thing, but Homefront does nothing to distinguish itself from an overflowing library of similar titles.

771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> The deeper we go into this story, the more ridiculous the coincidences and plot twists.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Despite some ridiculous twists and turns, the movie could have worked with a lightfooted, confident, breezy touch, but instead director Gary Fleder seems to have missed the point.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The film is mostly predictable, but throws a few curveballs and ends up being surprisingly entertaining, if not at all outstanding.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Action-drama "Homefront" has screenwriter Sylvester Stallone's touch written all over it. Director Gary Fleder keeps things moving.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> Everyone cast against type. Everyone breathtakingly bad, reciting dialogue by Sylvester Stallone that begs for a "mute" button.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Homefront aims to be retro, greasy comfort food but despite its lowly ambitions, there's barely enough spice here to merit a decent burp.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> There's something almost refreshing about a movie that delivers exactly what's expected of it.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Fleder does Stallone no favours, directing Homefront strictly as a plodding and predictable thriller, the kind of generic project that usually stars a bunch of B-level actors.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> It's a drive-in programmer with a weirdly over-qualified cast - slight but lean and deceptively smarter, in spots, than it lets on.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> [It] isn't Statham's best - or most brutal - work, but it's not bad.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Fleder, who is a pretty standard button-masher as an action director, actually shows infectious relish and nuance in depicting Statham's slow return to his violent ways.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Homefront is ridiculously overdone.

771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> This is a straightforward thriller with beatings, shootings, a young girl in peril, and a stoic hero who never loses his cool.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Too bad Franco's performance gets buried under an avalanche of cliches and blurry fight scenes so poorly edited that we can't actually tell what's happening.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Homefront is just another Jason Statham movie. Fortunately, that spells competent entertainment with a blood-red cherry of payback on top.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> "Homefront" is hard not to like and impossible to respect.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> The worst sin is visited upon Statham: Sure, those fists fly, but his poetry has become a chopped-up hash.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Pardon me, "Homefront," but I'm having a little trouble finding James Franco, as a bayou meth lord, to be much of a match for Jason Statham, as an ex-DEA agent hiding out anonymously with his daughter.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> For one brief moment in "Homefront," you will think: This is going to be awesome.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> It's not a great action film by any stretch of the imagination, but when working with something as old as water, you've got to appreciate the effort at being different - if only slightly.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> The entertainingly one-note Statham tossed together with chronically versatile James Franco-in a movie scripted by Sylvester Stallone, no less.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Homefront is what Breaking Bad may have resembled had Sylvester Stallone written the TV show.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Jason Statham is too tough to ever seem overwhelmed, imposed or vulnerable, and Sylvester Stallone's script requires some measure of those feelings amid the schlock.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Jason Statham and James Franco squaring off over meth with a script by Sylvester Stallone? Sounds like a guilty pleasure, right? Unfortunately, the result is a rather rote action thriller that only comes alive during the well-staged fight scenes.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> To alternate fistfights and gunplay with paternal tenderness is a tall order for any action movie, and to do so without slowing things down is nearly impossible.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> The strength of Statham's performance, coupled with a refreshingly lack of computer-generated blood effects, goes a long way towards compensating for the less-than-eventful nature of Stallone's screenplay...
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Franco, as is often the case, seems to be acting in his own private movie and having a grand old time doing so; results for the audience may vary.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> "Homefront" neither stoops below nor strains above being what it is; it's an acceptable action-thriller, a high-protein and high-fat release at a time when more virtuous, leafy and fibrous films crowd the theaters in the season before Oscar madness.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Franco, who brought so much dynamic weirdness to the role of Alien in Spring Breakers, looks as engaged here as he did while hosting the Oscars.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> We don't really need this old thing, which tries to be a modern Western but ends up being a swampy, derivative action film, indebted to B movies of the '70s but unable to pay the debt in an interesting way.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> A disappointing mess of a genre flick.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> There's plenty going on to satisfy action fans, and they'll get a bit more than they bargained for.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Playing defense plays a lot better than bloody offense.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> Statham delivers all the expected scowls and growls, but there's no originality, nuance or even dumb-fun catharsis to recommend this inept exercise in punch-'em-up justice.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> It works, in a generic way, but there are no surprises.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> A picture that could more tellingly be titled "More of the Same."
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Standard issue Statham actioner, but Kate Bosworth is a gaunt meth-head revelation
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> It's too devoid of worthwhile action set pieces to satisfy as an action film, too dull to work as a thriller, and too dumb to work as an earnest crime drama.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.45 <###> Just when you thought you had seen the craziest James Franco performance of the year...
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> 'Homefront' believes it's cut from the same cloth as Walter Hill's 'Southern Comfort,' but it can barely muster up the thrills of an episode of 'MacGuyver.'
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Another dumb action movie with a couple of fun fight sequences, none of which make up for the weak cliche-filled story that tries too hard to be a serious drama.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Homefront is an action movie born in the wrong generation, but it's still a fun and wild watch thanks to Jason Statham's warpath through a sleepy Southern town.
771313213 <###> Homefront <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> The material plays out like a particularly busy episode of Sons of Anarchy, possessing a peculiar joylessness that's anathema to the success of films like this.
770880071 <###> Eerie Midnight Horror Show <###> Horror <###> 0.2 <###> Truly painful horror movie. For die hards only.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Nothing more than an excuse for violent ninja fighting with a huge body count and plenty of blood - real and CGI.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> It would be hard to expect any surprises from a film called Ninja Assassin, but on the other hand, it would be hard to be disappointed by it either. It does exactly what it says on the tin.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> ...one, long, martial-arts fight.... Given the talents involved, we have to mourn what might have been.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Decent ingredients but, as a whole, this is lacking in choreographic flair and plot substance.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> A garish and poorly filmed chop-socky frolic that makes about as much sense as an Escher painting viewed through Vaseline-smudged Ray-Bans.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> Ninja Assassin is final proof that the once innovative Wachowski Brothers have indeed lost their creative mojo.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> The fight scenes are uninspired and I suspect post-pubescent audiences will be very bored.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> The fight scenes are mostly great. And Rain, so dashing in Speed Racer, is something to behold. His precisely rippled and defined body is awe-inspiring.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Ninja Assassin is little more than a sporadically diverting disposable movie that will probably spawn several straight-to-DVD sequels. The butcher's shop window is still a more fulfilling proposition though.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> The bulk of the fight sequences take place at bed-time so it's difficult to see exactly what's going on - it's like putting a colony of bats in a Magimix. In the dark.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> As it geysers forward from that claret-soaked opening scene, V For Vendetta director James McTeigue's mega-violent B-movie packs shock and gore and, to be frank, not much else.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> Since the fights are all digitally conjured up anyway, genuine thrills are at a minimum and the copious sprays of pixelated blood quickly pall.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.0 <###> For a film about silent assassins, it's phenomenally noisy. But if you're into swearing, decapitation and sliced-off limbs, and your brain has been reduced to mush by sitting in front of violent video games, this is the movie for you.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> Despite an insanely visceral opening sequence in which limbs are severed amid fountains of claret, we're all too soon left with a tedious police procedural, sprinkled with the odd fight scene that confuses more than thrills.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> When the slicing and dicing and blood-spurting become as unstoppably frenzied as they do in the course of Ninja Assassin, one's instinct is less to take fright than take 40 winks and hope to wake up when it's all over.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> The first time we see heads roll it's entertaining. The second time it's boring. The eighth time...
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> A bit of a let down. We expected more.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> Tedious action thriller that goes rapidly downhill after a decent opening, thanks to a nonsensical plot, dodgy acting and repetitive, over-CGI-ed fight scenes.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> There are some stand out moments of stylized action. Shame it lacks self awareness. Excess is its downfall and the improbable and wildly over the top action grows wearisome and dull. Quite often, less really is more.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> All the expensive surface distraction in the world can't make up for leaden plotting, paper-thin characters and lousy dialogue.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> If you go to a movie called Ninja Assassin--mayhem is what you signed up for. If you expected Crouching Tiger, then please check your meds.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> revels in the unrealistic absurdity of both its plot and its action sequences, plying the audience with its splatterfest silliness but always keep a straight face just in case
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Ninja Assassin features gigabytes of blood being shed on screen.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Rarely as fun as its title suggests...

770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Never tries to be anything but a slick update of the cheap martial arts thrillers distributed by Cannon Films in the 1980s...
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Ninja Assassin could - and should - have been the Zombieland of martial arts flicks. Instead, it's just totally skip-able.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Delivers everything you'd expect from a film titled "Ninja Assassin."
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> "Ninja Assassin" will not be enjoyed by all, specifically the female crowd who will feel assassinated by this action film.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> This hyperkinetic gorefest should have remained in the shadows.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> If you think this looks like a gorefest from the trailers, just wait until you see the whole thing.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Everything in Ninja Assassin is over-amped.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.3 <###> An excessively gory, gruesome chopsocky thriller. A bloody bore.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> ...little more than an action programmer, but a worthy entry rather than something destined for the DVD clearance bins.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> The plot's pretty basic, but it's surprisingly hard to follow.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Ninja Assassin has little opportunity to fill its action-free beats with dread or tension.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Fast-moving and gruesomely satisfying fight fest ... that rarely lets pesky character or plot development get in between a hail of shuriken and their target.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.25 <###> Blood spurts out of every imaginable orifice without a respectable clot in sight. Welcome to the poorly-scripted gush-fest, perfect for the Xbox set -- it's not a film, it's Grand Theft Ninja.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> While there is more to Ninja Assassin than endless gory excess, what's remains is like an arterial spray afterthought.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> The gory decapitations and gushing blood - imagine filling a million balloons with cherry Kool-Aid and using them in a water-balloon fight - turn the action scenes into an indistinguishable sea of red.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> This saga, set in Berlin, is more committed to its bloodletting than to any of its characters.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Working with screenwriters Matthew Sand and J. Michael Straczynski (from an original story by Sand), McTeigue provides enough wire-fu fights and stylish gore to please the fan boys who expect ample bloodletting from an R-rated action movie.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.0 <###> If bloody mayhem is your idea of fun, this movie could cause you to explode in joy.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.25 <###> As I left the theater, I found that my thumbs ached. I hadn't realized that, during certain parts of the movie, I was pressing imaginary buttons as if trying to control some video game.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> A movie that provides plenty of jolts but precious little pleasure.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> This movie knows exactly what it is: Gonzo silliness about bodies turned into human salsa.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> Thanks to the movie's dire script, flat performances and excessively slick, tricked-out fight scenes, it gets increasingly hard to care about anything that goes on here, even when it happens to be visible without the use of night-vision goggles.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> McTeigue obscures whatever is happening on screen, using bad lighting and rapid editing when he should be holding the image still and letting viewers see what they came for.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> A balletic collection of blood-spattered martial arts moves that's bound to delight fans of the genre.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Ninja Assassin is wildly improbable and completely unrealistic, but it's also bloody good fun.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.25 <###> Unfortunately, uninteresting characters, disjointed storytelling and an unbearable lull in the action cut Ninja Assassin off at its knees. It's the viewers who will beg for mercy here.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> This one is simply a diverting, uncommonly violent action flick. No need for an extended critical postmortem. Except to say the Wachowski brothers' trademark seems to have turned into a designer brand dedicated to producing inexpensive knockoffs.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> Turn your brain off and turn up the blood splatter.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> What's a recovering ninja assassin to do? Why, paint the screen bright red, of course. Splatter it on. We're talking streaks and rivers of blood -- bloody swords, bloody clothes and, my personal favorite, bloody stumps.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> If I want to spend 90 minutes with better lighting on the ninja's body than the fighting, give me Lucinda Dickey in Ninja III: The Domination any day of the week.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.0 <###> Ninja Assassin, awash in a veritable flood of patently fake CG blood - some of which ends up bespotting the "camera," no less - feels like getting stuck on Level 1 of the 1992 beta version Mortal Kombat for two hours.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> You certainly can't accuse Ninja Assassin of not living up to its title, but the filmmakers clearly never thought beyond that point.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Can be ridiculously exhilarating.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> If a film that's as over-the-top violent and gory as Ninja Assassin can't get an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings board, it's unlikely any film will.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> It's brisk and exciting and exuberantly obvious filmmaking, but it knows how to light up every bloodthirsty pleasure center in your brain, and does so with gusto.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> Heads may roll, torsos get severed and geysers of blood spurt, but no amount of CGI'd gore can save 'Assassin' from being dramatically lame, visually impaired and kinetically flat-footed.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.25 <###> Nearly incomprehensible, the picture devolves quickly into an array of shaky cam, epilepsy-inducing editing, and blatantly fake CGI bloodshed the color of red paint.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> The credits for Ninja Assassin list two screenwriters and one director. But it's fair to say the movie has come straight out of a box.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> This amateurish action flick is so lacking in personality or punch, it ought to be titled "V for Video Store Discount Bin."
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Uncertain of what it wants to be, Ninja Assassin will likely disappoint action fans with excessive CGI gore, and gore fans with excessive uninspired action.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> The rotten cliches pile up faster than the bodies in this Z-movie disaster. A total dud start to finish.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> An action film that only works as long as there are ninjas on-screen slicing and dicing each other, and not so much when anyone opens their mouth and speaks.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> McTeigue can barely shoot straight, and the editing is so hack-y, you have to take the stunts and fight choreography on faith.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> This movie may be filled with razor-sharp shuriken and katanas, but as far as the filmmaking goes, it's a blunt instrument.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.25 <###> This shockingly disjointed and relentlessly dull picture can't even deliver the martial-arts kick its title so plainly promises.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Gleefully bloody martial arts tribute - about a renegade ninja hunted by his clan - makes "Kill Bill" look like an episode of "7th Heaven".
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> There's more to making sword-and-splatter work than just shiny blades and blood. It's got to have an edge, and the one on Ninja Assassin is dull as a butter knife.
770780587 <###> Ninja Assassin <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> An East meets West splatterfest unfolding like a lethal cross of Crouching Tiger and Sam Peckinpah.
770732971 <###> The Deserted Station <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> A sweet, little unpretentious slice-of-life flick from Iran which, while highlighting the arid region's visually-arresting, utter desolation, ever so subtly hints at the tension between a simmering feminism and traditional Muslim values.
770732971 <###> The Deserted Station <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> The sweet script, crisp direction and a delightful performance by Leila Hatami, as the sad-eyed wife, should put Deserted Station on your must-see list.

770732971 <###> The Deserted Station <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> This deeply humanistic drama is strongly reminiscent of the earlier, less self-referential films of Abbas Kiarostami.
770732971 <###> The Deserted Station <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> It's a simple enough setup, but Raisian packs so much into it that multiple viewings may be necessary.
770732971 <###> The Deserted Station <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> For filmgoers who like dramas that are spare yet evocative, that focus on the subtleties of relationships, and that feature foreign settings completely off the beaten path, Deserted Station will be a masterpiece.
770732971 <###> The Deserted Station <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Melancholy, tender, and charged with rich symbolic power, it's a muted yet strangely fragile film that's as much about Middle Eastern womanhood as the horrors of parental bereavement.
770732971 <###> The Deserted Station <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> A modern gem of Iran's always interesting filmmaking industry.

770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.3 <###> Designed to make us feel like we've just witnessed a powerful experience. The reality of the film is that it's nothing but a shallow and underdeveloped position paper.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Rendition features decent performances by all its actors, although few are given any chance to shine.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> The film unfolds brilliantly and methodically, as director Gavid Hood's vivid characters are unwittingly drawn together.

770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Un thriller politico bastante critico hacia los metodos anti terroristas de Estados Unidos y sus aliados, en la misma linea de Syriana, Munich y Leones por Corderos (aunque mucho mas efectiva que esta ultima).
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Apresenta-se simultaneamente como um bom filme e, lamentavelmente, tambem como uma oportunidade desperdicada.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Rendition's heart is in the right place, but feels like a desperate single attempt to get it all out at once out of fear of losing another chance. I am glad I saw it, but I don't ever need to see it again.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> The film doesn't know or care who Anwar El-Ibrahimi is outside of how his plight affects the white folks connected with him.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Rendition gives its take on this practice with enough complexity to keep us engaged - and on the fence about how far our nation should go ...
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> "Rendition" is well-acted and well-written with a surprising twist that I didn't see coming. It's difficult to single out one performance - making it high on my list for an ensemble award. Powerful renditions by all involved.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Hood's greatest concern is the line between moral courage and cowardice.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> And what the heck does this title mean, anyway? Competing with "Things We Lost in the Fire" for its fuzzy appellation, "Rendition" refers to the U.S. policy of "extraordinary rendition" that allows the government to arrest and keep imprisoned anyone suspe
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> The thought that my life might be turned upside down merely by someone calling me is very frightening indeed.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Rendition is an important film. Art, by definition, is supposed to provoke, to spur emotions, to enlighten. On those counts, this movie scores a bull's-eye.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The stories are unflatteringly forced together, neither of them highlighting the thematic relevance of the other.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Rendition proves its own case by not finding an audience for its message -- and that is perhaps more disturbing than its scenes of torture.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> ...housing top-notch actors and their hefty paychecks but nothing else beyond the obviousness of the melodramatic malarkey it spouts with empty conviction.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Probes deep into a serious problem, and will entertain those who enjoy current events sprinkled over their cinema.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> The movie's insistent message about the morality and effectiveness of torture packs an unexpected and politically timely punch.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Although South African director Gavin Hood gave us the searing, Oscar-winning foreign film Tsotsi, he may not yet have enough experience to handle something on a grander scale.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> A political potboiler guaranteed to get your heart racing. It pushes all the buttons these kinds of suspenseful dramas usually do.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Rendition's approach feels additionally preachy and one-noted because its message is bigger than both the story and the human element.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> A movie that has only two major scenes for Streep and one for Arkin has talent to spare.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> That it's embarrassingly plausible, that it depicts things that have happened and that are probably still happening, is enough to make Americans sick to their stomach.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> What finally gives Rendition its headlong narrative momentum is the sense that we're rarely certain what argument the filmmakers are endorsing.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.25 <###> Toss in a bunch of one-dimensional characters, a major flashback that isn't triggered by a memory or a theme but simply by the convenience of the plot and an ending that makes absolutely no sense, and you end with a big, fat mess.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> It's one thing for a thriller to be timely, quite another for it to function as Rendition does, a gripping piece of entertainment with a clear head on its shoulders.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> It justly questions whether information gathered through torture is ever reliable, and whether human-rights violations only fan the flames of deadly anti-Americanism and revenge.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Rendition, while engrossing, does not grab us as it should.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Give us a genuine dilemma, put us on the spot. Rendition -- though it is a very good, challenging film that will have you thinking and talking afterward -- doesn't.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> Rendition has been made with an awful lot of volume and outrage, but you wish it had some intellect and artistry, too.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Morose instead of outraged and static instead of penetrating.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> [Hood] can be accused of one-siding the debate over interrogation tactics like water-boarding and electrocution. But since when do movies have to be fair and balanced?
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The kind of movie whose own self-importance is a turn off.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> A pat and generic, if serviceable, political thriller.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> In trying to respect every character's point of view, Hood doesn't reveal enough about any of them to make us truly care.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Rendition offers a reprieve right when it should really be tightening the screws.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> While truth is stranger than fiction, even melodramatic films can focus those truths.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A movie whose hot-button political issues already seem too warmed and worried over.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The performances are surprisingly lackluster. Witherspoon practically sleepwalks through the whole thing, as does Gyllenhaal.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> It raises worthwhile quandaries and delivers flashes of acting prowess -- from Streep in particular.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> What the film documents is that we have lost faith in due process and the rule of law, and have forfeited the moral high ground.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> or all these faults... the film has many plusses: n unsubtle emotional power that comes through in Abasi's fear and Isabella's rage, an honest view of the political machinery in Washington, and an outrage about the way we [can] behave.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Rendition is a reminder that, in the wrong hands, political outrage can be a slog.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> A brave piece of work, but by no means perfect.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> While Rendition is timely and invigoratingly noble, it doesn't really have any perspective. It's to torture what Amistad was to slavery. It's a $30 million AP brief.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> ...a limp drama in which too many good actors...get not enough screen time.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> A chamber-orchestra cousin to Paul Greengrass's topical symphonies of discussion. Sharp, damning and, at times, funny, this intricate thriller wisely chooses a puzzle-box pace, with no big speeches or easy outs for any character.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> This movie is composed in the increasingly familiar international hectic-mosaic style, with a note of justified paranoia.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Considering the incendiary subject matter - the use of torture to extract information - this political thriller should be a lot more compelling than it is.

770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Rendition is the result of such pompous over-pronouncements. It's a well-intentioned screed undone by its desire to make all sides of its conflict saintly simplistic.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A watchable but rigged and strangely forgettable drama that loses its nerve in the way its real-life political quarry rarely does.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> It's a weapon of mass distraction, designed to stop you realising this is about as challenging as a GCSE in General Studies.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Hood becomes a Hollywood player with a powerful, politically challenging film that pulls no punches. An impressive cast at the top of their game, plus a killer twist that's anything but a flashy gimmick.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A worthwhile but somewhat underwhelming effort, perhaps too level-headed for its own good.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> It goes without saying that Rendition is a matter worthy of your utmost attention.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Its clumsy efforts are toward an honest and difficult goal, which is to use the resources of mainstream movie-making to get viewers thinking about a moral crisis that many of us would prefer to ignore.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Hood squanders the film's considerable starpower by failing to elicit sharp performances from his marquee names.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Disappointingly dull given the explosive subject matter, this at least attempts to get a message into the mainstream. An extra star for effort rather than execution.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> Get ready for the absolute worst performance of Meryl Streep's career!
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Does its job, keeping the action involving, but in an increasing pool of U.S.-policy-and-the-Middle-East movies, it also feels like one of the crowd.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> If you're going to lecture us on the evils of torture, you better not make a film where in the end we feel there's more information to be discovered.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> The filmmakers' clumsy manipulation of the facts to fit their bias misses a golden opportunity to examine a troubling issue in an even-handed manner.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> can be best described as a fantasy.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> It stirs sympathy for one man's plight but little passion over the policy that imprisoned him.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> At every turn the screenplay turns geopolitics into Lifetime Channel pablum.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> What a cast, indeed. And what a bust as persuasive drama.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.125 <###> A naive, poorly-thought out, badly-reasoned left-wing(nut) manifesto that gives the Right all the ammunition it needs.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Explores the dark side of the so-called war on terrorism where human rights are ignored by the CIA and spit upon by Islamic terrorists.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The script by Kelley Sane is full of outrage but not enough depth.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A stale, murky drama so oversimplified that its politics boil down to a single tidy, elementary-level message: torture is bad.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A movie about secret government procedures can probably do without a subplot about a terrorist in love.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Reduces issues of burning domestic urgency to a rubble of burnt melodrama.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Despite the high stakes involved ... Rendition plods along with little vitriol and even less energy.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Rendition is watchable enough thanks to decent direction and strong performances.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> By crafting an intricate and engaging story out of this country's most despicable 'weapon' in the war on terror, it's possible that its message may be more well-received than the dozens of damning documentaries that have preceded it.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Director Hood did the satisfying South African Oscar winner Tsotsi, and he wrangles Rendition's multiple storylines with skill. He cannot elevate the writing, however.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It all adds up to a dilution of the real issues at hand ... With friends like this movie, who needs Dick Cheney?
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> One of the most heart-wrenching, dramatic films of the season.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Well-crafted political pot-boiler almost succeeds at being neither manipulative nor sensationalistic. Almost.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> We are ambushed by a simplistic storyline that's more interested in sermonizing and demonizing than existing in the real world where things aren't as clear-cut as the movie would like us to believe.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> An issue that springs from collective fear and the baser instincts it engenders deserves a better, more intelligent, and more perceptive treatment than the trite platitudes Rendition offers.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.25 <###> Hollywood kick-starts another Oscar season with a modish globetrotting guilt trip that histrionically explores how government policy and our involvement in the Middle East affects people in America on a personal level.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> In the end, there's enough excitement, dimension and an involved level of acting by an ensemble of first-rate players to make the time rendered worth spending.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.82 <###> Works both as a tense thriller (complete with a skilfully handled time twist), and as an urgent warning about the track the world is currently on.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> South African director Hood (Tsotsi) turns what could have been yet another Hollywood potboiler into an edgy dramatic thriller.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Hood, who knows what kind of movies win awards, crafts his tale so that every little detail falls neatly into place.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> It's not until the pieces finally start to fall into place that Rendition becomes the hard-hitting, thought-provoking drama Hood clearly wants it to be...
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The script isn't particularly impressive and with so many films exploring similar material, the film seems predictable and redundant.
770672302 <###> Rendition <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Hot off the headlines and onto the screen, this is a rarity -- a political film that delivers its timely message with a cinematic punch and no undue speechifying.
14865 <###> Diabolique <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.2 <###> The new Diabolique mostly dispenses with subtlety, contenting itself with regularly scheduled cathartic jolts that pass for suspense in our degraded culture.
14865 <###> Diabolique <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> If it makes at least one person search out and discover the original version, then it's all worth it.
14865 <###> Diabolique <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Chechik fails to create any real suspense or thrills and does not seamlessly juggle the serious thriller aspects with the black comedy
14865 <###> Diabolique <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.2 <###> Silly update of the French classic; the ending is an unforgivable cop-out.
14865 <###> Diabolique <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Why do Hollywood filmmakers keep messing around with and screwing up past successes?
14865 <###> Diabolique <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.25 <###> A hopelessly muddled mess.
14865 <###> Diabolique <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The husband is still a brute, and the swimming pool is still moldy, but the new Diabolique fails to translate into anything more than the latest ham-handed Hollywood makeover of a European classic.
770672305 <###> Gandhi, My Father <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> Gandhi, My Father weakly opts for lionization at precisely the moment it should go in for the killshot.
770672305 <###> Gandhi, My Father <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> It's overlong and repetitive, but it impressively gives us a full-bodied portrait of the icon.
770672305 <###> Gandhi, My Father <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Jariwalla and Khanna's competent performances, and Khan's simplistic screenplay fail to grip and elevate this from an average to an exceptional piece of cinema.
770672305 <###> Gandhi, My Father <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> There's nothing here to seriously damage Gandhi Sr's reputation; if anything, he is made more human.

472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> No one says, "Gimme the bat, Wendy," or, "Here's Johnny!" But they come close.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.2 <###> the Pang brothers know how to set a mood and you can tell they can handle the camera from the way they set up the opening, so it's too bad they had to work without a script
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> Feels like a movie you've already seen before but don't quite recall clearly. Given its pedigree (Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert are among the producers) an audience might hope for more.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.625 <###> Forgoes any more innovations, lazily borrowing from other people's horror movies.

472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.166666666667 <###> The well-amplified scares are so perfunctory as to be laughable. 'What's up with the crows?' bitches Kristen Stewart, clearly not up on her Hitchcock or any Asian thriller of the past ten years.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.2 <###> Just another craptacular exercise in weak PG-13 horror involving resourceful-but-stupid teens, idiotic adults and ghostly apparitions with short pants, pale skin and stringy hair.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> There might be less extravagant means of communicating than throwing an entire banister at someone or unceremoniously dragging them by their feet into the cellar.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.625 <###> The worst part of this film is its advertising; don't let the studio's lack of faith in their own ghost story ruin a clever little thriller for you.

472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> The plethora of horror movie cliches -- even those still residually effective -- weigh so heavily in The Messengers that whatever moments of terror that might have been had are left positively weightless.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> Every movie has to have its own sense of logic, horror movies perhaps most of all, but as this story heads towards its climax it begins to contradict what it's told us to believe all along.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> It's awards season, so we'd like to nominate The Messengers for the yet-to-be-established Tippi Hedren Award for best use of malignant ravens in a motion picture.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.6 <###> With The Messengers, the Pang brothers devise scenes so scary that they stain the imagination and never scrub out.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.25 <###> The Messengers isn't a particularly frightening or gory horror movie, but directors Danny and Oxide Pang do have a special talent for torturing the reputations of their actors.

Then again, any script that dared use that motif was setting itself up for a fall, and that's exactly what it got
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> The Messengers falls flat with its tedious plot, cliched storyline and unsurprising twist.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.375 <###> The Pangs might know how to knee-jerk shock an audience ad nauseam, but the remainder of The Messengers suffers from shamelessly thudding banality.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> However, in their (The Pangs) first serving of an American-made boofest served with all the fixings of a horror-induced bunt cake the taste still remains strikingly superficial
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.75 <###> Viewers who prefer to see blood splattering and internal organs being sliced and diced will be disappointed.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> The script is so tired and derivative that even though there are tiny scares here and there, it's boring after a while.

472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.3 <###> A stunningly inert, painfully derivative, shamelessly cheap and aggressively dull ghost story that delivers nothing you haven't seen before. About 43 times.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.625 <###> The Messengers is still worth seeing for the strength of its first half and for the consistently solid performances, but the sense of unrealized potential is tough to ignore.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> There isn't much of a script to work with, and for the occasional pull-out-the-stops moment, it never really builds towards its finish.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> The most frightening aspect of the film is that it will soon be haunting the bargain bins of shoddy video stores.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> The objective view gives the audience too much room to unravel its schematic plot, which is far less inspired than its creepy visuals.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> The Pangs keep it moving and deliver the 'gotcha!' moments, but a steady diet of mechanical scares is thin stuff.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> If The Messengers means to say something about all this familial and social dysfunction, that point is lost among hackneyed, decidedly unscary gyrations.

472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.7 <###> The first half is very well done, making it one of the best haunted house movies since The Grudge.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.375 <###> The Messengers borrows so heavily from The Amityville Horror, The Birds, The Grudge, Poltergeist, and others that it has no room left for anything of its own.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.375 <###> The grown-ups fare worse: They speak . . . very . . . slowly . . . as if to pad the running time out. This may in fact be the most ridiculous performance John Corbett has ever given.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.65 <###> The Pang Brothers' sense of style often overcomes the lack of substance in this derivative scarefest.
472231908 <###> The Messengers <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> Yet another supernatural thriller about ghostly apparitions and corpsy children, The Messengers doesn't deliver.

771385848 <###> Testament Of Youth <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> It's a strictly stiff-upper lip affair that occupies a time when old-fashioned values were being challenged and ultimately changed, in no small measure thanks to Brittain's strength as a social campaigner.

771314085 <###> Pawn Sacrifice <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Zwick's film sets the stage for a brilliant intellectual showdown, then hides away its content, as if worried he's going to scare us off with too much chess. He castles and fritters away his pieces, angling for a dull draw.

770682488 <###> Donkey Punch <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> A repulsive "thriller" that starts out using the syntax of a '70s porn movie and ends up as a sort of '80s slasher flick, only without the slasher.
770682488 <###> Donkey Punch <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> By Doug Cooper - Donkey is good enough to stand on its own two feet without the aid of the muckracking which the film-makers have not discouraged.

10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> The strength of Eastwood's Bridges is in its patience, and how it lets the love story develop from start to finish, even though the audience knows from the beginning the broad strokes of what's going to happen.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> With Eastwood as Kincaid and Meryl Streep as Francesca, this carefully observant love story turns Waller's pop-lit passion into screen art.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> Bridges is an admirable achievement, one that probably does more to reposition its maker as someone who can carry a movie without carrying a gun than as the director/star of a Love Story for the Loving Care set.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Those who found Waller's book an outrageously bad read may be gratefully surprised to find less mush in the movie.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> Beautifully photographed and directed with an intimate maturity, the film reveals its characters in an unhurried way, thus making the audience accomplices in the unfolding liaison.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> The result, if rather thin and certainly far from a masterpiece, is nevertheless quite lovely. This affecting little film is easily one of Eastwood's best efforts as a director.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> Eastwood's Bridges has the energy and spontaneity of a picture that was shot quickly. And that serves the material well, because it removes the solemnity that could stiffle a modern classic.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> The Bridges of Madison County is as good as it is because of its performances. It's as bad as it is because of its source.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> Still one of Hollywood's most assured directors, Clint Eastwood transcends the story's cliches with a classically restrained yet steadily imaginative filmmaking style.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> Streep and Eastwood's chemistry makes the film.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> The film is good enough; Streep is the X-factor that makes it excellent.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> Little happens here apart from a long, slow buildup to sentimentalized coitus, but there's no denying the sheer screen presence of these two 500-lb. gorillas of pop culture.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> An unlikely choice as director and producer, it's thanks to Eastwood's relatively thin sentimental streak that the film doesn't fall headlong into a lagoon of schmaltz.

10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> This didn't pain me anywhere near as much as I thought it would. A money-grab, surely, and Clint's weird bush story is very awkward, but generally charming enough for a date with a boring person.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> Atmospheric love story with Eastwood and Streep in great form.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Eastwood can do no wrong in my eyes ... but he came dangerously close with this one.

10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Eastwood's Robert Kincaid -- made out in the book to be some sort of quasi-mythical cross between the Marlboro Man and Ralph Waldo Emerson -- is toned down so much as to be almost uncompelling.

10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> A more than solid piece of entertainment that proves that romance isn't dead after all.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> A dizzy, dusty masterpiece
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> What the movie does that the book couldn't do is tap into the poignancy that comes of seeing two stars who used to be young and beautiful suddenly looking very mortal.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> I've seen the movie twice now and was even more involved the second time, because I was able to pay more attention to the nuances of voice and gesture.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> The Bridges of Madison County is a beautiful film, not only in the way it was photographed, but for the manner through which the characters are revealed to us.

10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> Respect to Clint for putting his cojones on the line to make a 'chick flick,' and utmost respect to him for pulling it off with aplomb.
10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.9 <###> Bridges is another example of Eastwood's remarkable economy of style as both a director and an actor. It is neither his best work nor his worst, though it is a fascinating exploration.

10187 <###> The Bridges of Madison County <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> The gap between touchy-feely and touching isn't easy to span, so credit judicious pruning on the one hand and a beefed-up script on the other for getting perhaps the best possible movie out of Robert James Waller's The Bridges of Madison County.
10183 <###> Annie Hall <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> Allen (as a result of his exposure to Bergman, perhaps) has greatly matured as a filmmaking talent. Annie Hall is, by far, his most sophisticated, most emotionally complex film.
10183 <###> Annie Hall <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> Although Woody Allen had still to acquire great technical strength as a film-maker, this was the movie where he found his own singular voice, a voice that echoes across events with a mixture of exuberance and introspection.

10183 <###> Annie Hall <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> Many things mark Annie Hall's place in cinema history, but none of them are the reason you should see this movie. That would be the humour, poignancy and acute observation contained in each and every frame.

10183 <###> Annie Hall <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> Woody Allen is a genius. You can't even say that he really is an American filmmaker, because his movies are in a category of their own.
10183 <###> Annie Hall <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> I love how honest this movie is. It's raw, it's awkward, and it's ugly, but it's all right there and right on.
10183 <###> Annie Hall <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> Watching it again, 25 years after its April 1977 premiere, I am astonished by how scene after scene has an instant familiarity.
10183 <###> Annie Hall <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> It's a slight story but what makes this film significant in Allen's long career is that it's really the first time he wrote adult characters.
10183 <###> Annie Hall <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.9 <###> Woody's most romantic and most poignant comedy, albeit a neurotic one.
10183 <###> Annie Hall <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.9 <###> Just when you feel like you want to look away, it brings you back with a devastating one-liner.
10183 <###> Annie Hall <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.93 <###> That this Woody Allen film is of such raw-nerved honesty is admirable. That it is also so incessantly funny is remarkable.

10182 <###> Ocean's Eleven <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> So how is the actual movie? It's okay. It's not great, it's not bad...it's so-so.

771375953 <###> Because I Was a Painter <###> Documentary;Art House & International <###> 0.5 <###> This could have been an important documentary and it very nearly is already, but much of the viewing experience needs to be rethought and alterations need to be made.

10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> It is in Gray's spirited execution that such by-the-book formula makes for a brisk, slick entertainment hits the summer movie spot.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Gray adds some zip to this remake of the 1969 Michael Caine caper flick, but despite two clever action sequences and some uncharacteristically tight performances from his cast (most notably Charlize Theron and Mark Wahlberg), the con remains the same.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> A passable time-waster ... directed with some grace and snap.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Heist movies seem pretty quaint and analog in our era where high stakes crime is primarily electronic in nature. But until someone can make embezzlement cinematically interesting, we're left with theft and this movie just gets away with it.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> F. Gary Gray has crafted a fun summer film packed with action, comedy, and a talented ensemble cast.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Gray does a solid enough job behind the camera, although it's clear he feels more at home directing the action sequences than the quieter moments.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> This is escapist fare that doesn't pretend to be Shakespeare. For what it purports to be, I found it entertaining.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> A light caper movie, with heavy emphasis on the word 'light' -- light plot, light action, light violence, light sex, light humor, light acting.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> ... workmanlike heist flick with some funny lines and some good (if brief) chases ...
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> The Italian Job might have been an enjoyable ride if it had even an ounce of creative intelligence.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> Memories of the 1960s caper classic are obliterated by this pointless remake, which uncomprehendingly salvages a few elements from the original, while behaving as if no one involved cared or liked it much anyway.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Uma Saida de Mestre faz jus ao original - principalmente por nao limitar-se a copia-lo.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> This is a good ole heist film and worth the price of admission.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Go in expecting nothing and you'll end up with more than Caine and his onscreen crew did 34 years ago.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Peter Collinson's The Italian Job (1969) is not a great film -- it's an average film with a great finale. Oh, and another thing: F Gary Gray's remake blows the bloody doors off it.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> A remarkably average heist flick that's entertaining, but completely devoid of surprises and major thrills.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> It has little to do with the original film but it's stylishly directed and has an infectious sense of fun.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Unlike the original, this Mini adventure lacks a single defining moment. But, as Michael Caine remakes go, it's way better than Get Carter.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Sure you've seen this movie before. Heck, 14 times probably in the last year, but it gets the escapist, time-wasting job done.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> F. Gary Gray's The Italian Job isn't Art, but it is rather Cool.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> It does exactly what we expect it to do very well, charming us with style, wit, and the simple boldness of real-life car chases.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Given the unenthusiastic and uninspired script, the cardboard cutout characters, and the humdrum chase sequences, I can only assume that this was a 90 minute palette for [Mini-Cooper] product placement, rather than an actual film.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Despite leaving out the charm and cheekiness of the earlier film, this is an efficient and enjoyable romp.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Although some will predictably succumb to Gray's overly kinetic and slick-looking heist caper, this stylized action-packed robbers flick fails to steal anything worth value within this repetitive genre.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> For a thrilling piece of mouth-breathing summer entertainment, this is one of the better rides you will find.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Solid direction by F. Gary Gray, a scintillating cast of supporting players and plenty of screen time for everyone's favorite little engine that could -- the MINI Cooper -- all push The Italian Job above and beyond typical remake requirements.

10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> A superior entry in the exhausting oeuvre of genre classics given a slick spit-and-polish for the next generation (think 'Ocean's Eleven') - if that's your bag, shift your brain into first (but not neutral) and enjoy.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Every once in a while, a film comes along that is just so much pure fun that I kind of hate to see it end. This is one of them.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.66 <###> About as unremarkable as a big budget special effects and car chase-filled movie can be.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> When an armored truck vanishes on Hollywood Boulevard, it's a nifty metaphor for the way this relatively unheralded flick is likely to steal millions in box-office gold from under the noses of such glamorous competitors as 'X2' and 'Matrix'...
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Let us now ponder the allure of the star of this movie: The new Mini Cooper.

10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> No one here manages the pure Carnaby Street cool of young Michael Caine ... but Gray and his cast are having such fun that it's hard to fault them for it.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> The genre and the premise and the template are the true stars of this film. And none of them lets us down.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> It intends to be a good-looking, high-energy, kinda-quirky thrill ride. It does not aspire to be anything else, and it isn't.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> A few of the parts may be lacking, but their sum equals an enjoyable caper film that will have you uttering "Nice!," "Sweet!," and "Damn!" and laughing loudly throughout.

10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> This version moves like a freight train, but suffers from a debilitating charm deficit.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Take this Job and floor it.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> A likable movie that is one lead actor away from being lots of fun.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> This is Wahlberg's third remake of a '60s film in three years, and it's time he left that poor decade alone.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> This is pure entertainment but smart entertainment, plotted and executed with invention and humor and acted by a winning cast radiating good-movie energy.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> The best remake since The Thomas Crown Affair got a delicious new lease on life.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> It took me 30 years to forget the first Italian Job but only about 30 minutes for the new one to fade from memory. But it's fun while it lasts.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> An old-school respite from the season's near-endless parade of Internet warriors and comic book heroes.

10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> The Italian Job may not be the most memorable film you'll see all summer, but it's a fairly good alternative to many of the prequels and sequels we have ahead of us.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Any film that wastes Edward Norton while boring us with Mark Wahlberg has its priorities all messed up.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> Like Charlie, The Italian Job is appealing because it's so cool, confident and a bit cocky.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> The Italian Job is the movie equivalent to a big beach novel: It's light, it's entertaining, it will keep your attention and it's no big strain on the brain.

10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> It's lacking the sense of whimsy that was so plentiful in the 1969 original.

10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> The Italian Job has a decent enough heart, and, thanks to Seth Green and Mos Def, some funny moments. It's just not racing with enough adrenaline.

10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> A movie so eagerly and infectiously living for the moment that it barely follows the contours of the 1969 British caper flick that inspired it.

10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> The talented cast and competent direction keep you rooting for these good thieves, even when common sense urges you to keep your cool.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Heist - great dialogue + The Fast and the Furious - charismatic lead + Ocean's 11 - A-list cast + cool Mini cars = Italian Job
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> I just wish the movie hadn't kept getting in the way of watching the cars.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> A slicker, faster-paced, high-tech upgrade that lifts the sprightly spirit and the main action set piece from the original while developing its own twists and a new ending that, though a bit too pat and eager to please, is a vast improvement.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Get out and see this!
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Above all, The Italian Job is a feature-length commercial for the Mini Cooper.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Filled with easy-to-like characters, innovative action sequences and a story rife with momentum, the movie is as endearingly zippy as the BMW MINIs the heroes use to pull off their scam.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> I actually wrote this script in college but my roommate swiped it while I was taking a nap - no, no that was something else. This is not quite as glittering as the gold they steal but it is entertaining.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> What sets The Italian Job apart -- or at least makes it a successful effort -- is a sense of uncertainty during the film's splendidly crafted bookend robbery sequences.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> Having proved he was no Cary Grant in The Truth About Charlie, Mark Wahlberg now demonstrates that he's also no Michael Caine (not that I think anyone has been devoting a lot of time to wondering about that).
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> A lazy and in-name-only remake of 1969's G-rated Michael Caine heist pic.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.55 <###> The film is certainly easy enough to watch, as are many heist films, and you probably won't feel shortchanged after watching the new The Italian Job.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Watching The Italian Job in a theater makes you long for a fast-forward button -- to skip past 90 eyeball-glazing minutes of generic caper plotting and cut to the chase, as it were.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> Still, when it's working, the current film is as sweet as a plate of cannoli.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> A 'robbers and robbers' film that fails to distinguish itself from any of the others.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> The film goes exactly where you expect it to go without offering much in the way of surprises and I still smiled from credit-to-credit.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> OK, so maybe it doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the 1969 Michael Caine film - but there's a wide array of quality in between "pretty good" and "adored classic".
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Memo to the studio honcho holding remake rights to Easy Rider: Don't take any calls from Mark Wahlberg.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> ...a lot like the Mini Coopers it features -- slight but sleek.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> The new Italian Job takes a rollicking caper comedy and turns it into another dull thriller.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Even though the 1969 original Italian Job had Michael Caine in the title role, carrying out the plans of imprisoned criminal mastermind Noel Coward, this new version has it all over the original.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Get in the car: This movie is worth the drive.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> The Minis rule the road for 14 minutes in The Italian Job, and not a second of it is anything but screeching fun.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> With its impeccable timing, steady kinetic drive and superbly choreographed chase sequences through the canals of Venice and the streets of Los Angeles, the movie, directed by F. Gary Gray, feels a like smooth, exciting whoosh down a ski slope.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> The movie fails to understand the key ingredients of a great heist.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Wahlberg is largely forgettable, and his would-be romance with Theron is sparkless and perfunctory.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> The new version has no higher goals than to provide a fun, lightweight crime caper like they used to make before Kaiser Soze started everyone brooding.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> The clever opening and rousing finish will stay with you long after the memory of Norton's tonsorial folly fades.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> The Italian Job zooms along with confidence, smarts, and some of the coolest car chases this side of the Indy 500.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> Screenwriting couple Donna and Wayne Powers have managed to downgrade what was only a half-decent 1969 crime flick to begin with.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Smart, quick-paced and entertaining.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Crafty and cracking with terrific tension...The intricacies and unforeseen snags of the plot are at least as exciting as the car chases.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> This movie has more personality and humor than most films of its recent type.
10189 <###> The Italian Job <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Formulaic, forgettable remake whose resemblance to a video-game is surely not coincidental. Edward Norton, Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deliver the most bland, nondescript, uninteresting performance of their careers. You've seen it all in the trailer

770681823 <###> Baby Mama <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Neither Tina Fey nor Amy Poehler, former Saturday Night Live colleagues, has a compelling big-screen presence. And as a team they're no Martin and Lewis. Still, their lightweight double act passes the time agreeably.

770681823 <###> Baby Mama <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The movie was written and directed by a man, Michael McCullers. But it cuts out the obligatory middleman and lets two women make us laugh, often very hard.
770681823 <###> Baby Mama <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Baby Mama lets Amy Poehler shine on the big screen. The only question is, why did Hollywood wait so long to give her a starring role?

770681823 <###> Baby Mama <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The only reason it works as well as it does -- or that it even works at all -- is because of its star, former SNL head writer Tina Fey, who's really turning into an endearing comic performer.
770681823 <###> Baby Mama <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Every moment of this project feels beat-driven, focus-grouped and designed to package Fey as a viable movie star with great pins (as one character takes pains to note) to go with the breasts (ditto). This isn't writing, it's advertising.

770681823 <###> Baby Mama <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> [Writer/director] McCullers takes all the loose plot strands and ties them in a neat knot and cuts it, as an obstetrician might a newborn's umbilicus. Still, I left with a smile.
770681823 <###> Baby Mama <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There are a handful of solid laughs, but there are more than a few duds in the mix. One suspects that had Tina Fey penned the film herself, it wouldn't have been half as conventional and plodding.

770681823 <###> Baby Mama <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Just like it is in the world of SNL, the choice gets made time and again to aim not for the high road but for the great, big, fat, juicy, unchallenging, uncontroversial middle ground, where everybody's laughing but nothing is all that funny.
770681823 <###> Baby Mama <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The humor outweighs the holes in the story, Fey and Poehler look to be a comedy team built to last -- let's hope so -- and those who find Judd Apatow's comedies lacking in decent female roles have found their film.
770681823 <###> Baby Mama <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A comedy boasting fetching performances by Saturday Night Live stars Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.

771325470 <###> Jessabelle <###> Drama;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> Despite a few scenes fraught with genuine suspense and Snook's strong, centered performance as a wounded woman in survival mode, Jessabelle operates on the ridiculous premise that young ghosts actually grow up and mature just like regular people.

12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Love Actually , Curtis' holiday-themed directing debut, abandons any pretext of sophistication for gloppy sentimentality, sugary pop songs and bawdy humor -- an approach that works about half the time.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Call me Scrooge, but I sincerely hope that this film does not become a Christmas perennial.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> All too rare is the holiday film that not only makes you feel good, but also is good. Love Actually works.

12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> It's too busy with too many stories to tell. But there's so much heart and silly fun and genuine sentiment here, delivered by an A-list of Brit and American talent that it's hard to fault.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Slick but uneven romantic comedy.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> For a fairy tale, Love Actually is highly entertaining.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> Finally, a delightful piece of Christmas fluff to chase away visions of chainsaw-wielding serial killers.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> [Curtis] is nothing if not capable of creating merry, madcap romantic comedy, and he punctuates the purposely hackneyed developments and labyrinthian structure with sly wit and sprightly pacing.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> There's so much plot being thrown at us in Love Actually that there's little room for genuine emotion; the film is as superficial as a Jay Leno monologue.

12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.7 <###> There is probably something for everybody in this movie. If you don't like some segment, and the people in it, just wait a few minutes.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> It pushes its 'love is good' message with such insistence, so many cheery pop tunes, airport hugs, coincidences and teary smiles, that it feels like one long commercial.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> The pacing's off in places as well, and the movie is flabby and lightweight, feeling every bit as long as its 130 minutes. But the performances are quite good.

12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Unrequited love does not exist. In fact, there's so much requiting going on, we start wishing to see someone get dumped just to add a little excitement to the mix.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Rather sprawling in its portrayal of several love stories, the film strikes some appeal at times, and misses the mark at others.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> The movie feels like Curtis pasted together pages from his sketchbook, throwing every good -- or bad -- idea into a single film.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.95 <###> Hope springs eternal, love is everywhere, and Keira Knightley is genetic perfection.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> The movie's only flaw is also a virtue: It's jammed with characters, stories, warmth and laughs, until at times Curtis seems to be working from a checklist of obligatory movie love situations and doesn't want to leave anything out.

12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Though it would be dishonest to call this an unqualified success, it would be churlish not to tip the hat to Love Actually's genuine charm.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Writer-director Richard Curtis has jam-packed the story with too many characters and the whole thing borders on sickeningly sweet. But a fitfully funny screenplay and irreproachable cast keep you from suffering cinematic toothache.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.25 <###> Watching all this is like looking under the Christmas tree and finding everything you ever wanted (all those stars!) and everything you don't want (all that bathroom humor!) shoved into one carelessly wrapped package.

12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Individually, the tales wouldn't stand up as short stories. Together, they make for sporadically amusing, ultimately wearying viewing.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.7 <###> A bunch of cutesy characters saying cutesy things... that ultimately, well, turn out cutesy and romantic.

12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> As a director, Curtis can't seem to rein in his writer.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> There are times when all of this goodwill feels a tad forced and artificial, but, on balance, Love Actually is appealing and genial with plenty of solid laughs, and worthy of a recommendation for those who appreciate this kind of thing.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> I smiled throughout, charmed by the stories' feel-good rhythms and the sense of something lovely and quixotic lurking just around the corner.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> All these characters and story threads feel sketchy and incomplete, as if Curtis had written four or five dead-end drafts on one theme, then decided to try combining them all.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> Thank you Universal for the perfect holiday gift, Love Actually -- one hilarious poem of a picture to the joy of love!

12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> Love Actually is emotionally manipulative, but pleasantly so.
12852 <###> Love Actually <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> [Richard Curtis is] a smart enough filmmaker to play with cliches without ever falling back on them; the overall structure is carefully manipulative and we don't mind at all.
12856 <###> Hotel Rwanda <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Like "Schindler's List," "Hotel Rwanda" shows how the madness of genocide and war converted one man's context of wealth and success from capitalism to humanitarianism.

12856 <###> Hotel Rwanda <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> What makes the film not just harrowing but transcendent is Cheadle. He does nothing traditionally heroic.

12856 <###> Hotel Rwanda <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> If Hotel Rwanda does nothing more than provoke the obvious questions of 'How did this happen?' and 'How can we prevent it from happening again?' it has, like the hotelier who refuses to consider himself a hero, done its job.
12856 <###> Hotel Rwanda <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> The world stayed out of Rwanda for fear of doing an imperfect job. Bold filmmakers are at their best when they mature beyond that kind of paralysis.

12856 <###> Hotel Rwanda <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The subject is crucially important, but the movie dilutes its impact with by-the-numbers filmmaking, and Cheadle's one-note performance displays few of his acting gifts.
12856 <###> Hotel Rwanda <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> The twofold agenda in Hotel Rwanda is to commemorate what Paul Rusesabagina did and to shame each and every Westerner who sees the movie. On both of those counts it is successful.

12856 <###> Hotel Rwanda <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> If [Schindler's List] had never been made, Hotel Rwanda might seem better than it does, and probably better than it is.

770669722 <###> Still Life (Sanxia Haoren) <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.7 <###> As much an exploration of emotional and cultural problems in modern day China, as it is the tale of one man's lost love.
770669722 <###> Still Life (Sanxia Haoren) <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> Never has destruction looked more beautiful than the demolished buildings in Jia Zhang-ke's Still Life.

770669722 <###> Still Life (Sanxia Haoren) <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> Jia Zhang-ke is a new auteur making his mark. Embraced abroad on the international festival circuit, if less welcome on screens in China, this writer-director works in a genre that could be called globalist.
770669722 <###> Still Life (Sanxia Haoren) <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> Still Life is the first great film of the year. It's beautiful but so much more--full of subtle feeling, framed by a monstrous, eroding landscape.
770669722 <###> Still Life (Sanxia Haoren) <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> An artful and philosophical film, filled with visual riches and mystifying scenes, about change, loss, and the difficulty of letting go.
770669722 <###> Still Life (Sanxia Haoren) <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> Nothing much actually happens in Still Life, and yet one is left with a deep feeling of irrevocable loss and destructive change only heightened by the chirpy tourist patter and government promotional talk about the great Three Gorges Dam.
770669722 <###> Still Life (Sanxia Haoren) <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> Spare, motionless and silent as a still-life painting. But what [director] Jia is documenting is nothing less than a civilization in a state of flux. Chaos wouldn't be an overstatement.
770669722 <###> Still Life (Sanxia Haoren) <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> Few of China's Sixth Generation filmmakers have turned to their country's explosive economic growth and its attendant upheavals with so sharp an eye and so heavy a heart as Jia Zhang-ke.
770669722 <###> Still Life (Sanxia Haoren) <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> These searches are not particularly suspenseful or emotionally stirring, but they're excuse enough for us to take in the breath-taking views of Three Gorges, the river and the razing of buildings along its banks.
770669722 <###> Still Life (Sanxia Haoren) <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> In Still Life, the blood and the sweat run directly into the Yangtze River, where they mingle with more than a few tears.
770669722 <###> Still Life (Sanxia Haoren) <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> The results are exhilarating, expertly choreographed and a movie to change one's view of both cinema and life.
770669722 <###> Still Life (Sanxia Haoren) <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> Jia Zhangke has an uncanny knack for grounding his portraits of Chinese alienation in settings that are at once schematically allegorical and tangibly lived-in.
770669722 <###> Still Life (Sanxia Haoren) <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> Nothing much happens in Still Life, its atmosphere is everything. The characters, like the half-flooded town itself, linger between the past and an unknown future.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> It pulls the perfect con, which Ruffalo's character defines as a con where everyone gets what they want. The audience gets exactly what they want: A wild ride with an ending they won't see coming.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Rian Johnson injects punchy, off-kilter fantastical charm into his playfully globetrotting film. It's like a cuckoo clock - precise, ornate and screwy-looking. But Bloom and Penelope's love - and resultant rifts - comes off as real-world collateral.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Sure, The Brothers Bloom may be the headline act, but it is the sisters eccentric that make the film.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> We feel regularly discombobulated on the sea of this movie's ideas - which is a good thing for people feeling marooned by the general stupidity of this summer's film releases.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> If Wes Anderson and Terry Gilliam ever had a child, science would be amazed and appalled. But also, it would probably end up making a film like this.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The eccentric humour is an acquired taste and the contrived story overstays its welcome.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Johnson's script and directing style suffocates the duo with too many cookie-cutter indie movie quirks, making it all too easy to spot the joins and lose interest...
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's one of those films whose fun set-up is terrific, only to be offset by the muddled plot. Still, there are some decent laughs amid the mess.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Sharp, funny and stylish, but still, something doesn't quite fit...
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The effect is something like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels done by Wes Anderson in a morose mood, much as its creator would presumably resist the latter comparison.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Like his brooding anti-hero, Johnson keeps one step ahead and, at the same time, wears his heart on his sleeve. It's tough not to fall for such charm.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Oh dear.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> It lags a touch towards the end and it's ultra quirky, but the artifice doesn't rob the finale of emotion. In fact, it delivers unexpected rewards.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Blooming good fun.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Perhaps you can be too cool for school and too clever for a multiplex, but if you're willing to go along with this, you'll enjoy being fooled so much that you won't mind it's all a trick.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Now I know what it's like for those buzz killers who complain about Wes Anderson films.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A tale full of heart, heroism and old school fun, that with the addition of just a few witty zingers could have been one of the great films of the year.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This is the kind of "movie movie" that puts everything in quotation marks, letting Johnson indulge his most romantic daydreams.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The film is stuffed with visual gags, only some of which hit the spot. When Weisz is on screen even the more contrived of these seem forgivable.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> This is a beautiful film in many ways. It looks great, the performances are just a delight, Rachel Weisz is absolutely bewitching, it's funny and funky, eccentric and romantic.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This eccentric affair pretty much gets away with everything it tries, save for the occasional muffed joke and sudden mood swing.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> If not for Rachel Weisz, the movie would be too literary, too clever, too pleased with itself. Her character makes it emotional, although she's not the main focus.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Johnson's shaggy dog runs here, there, and everywhere, weaving joyous, confusing circles in exotic locations before romping home with an unexpected wallop.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.82 <###> A fine piece of cinematic legerdemain
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The film is fun, but the characters are not well developed. The audience has to be onboard not for the characters but for the twisty ride.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Follows an offbeat path to reach that destination, and most will enjoy the journey.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> ...it will baffle and infuriate some, and enchant and entertain others.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> "The Brothers Bloom" operates on a much larger scale, a globe-hopping, visually dazzling caper comedy, but at heart it's just as in love with language and storytelling as "Brick" was.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Unlike the con artists the movie depicts, 'The Brothers Bloom' rewards rather than exploits viewers by defying their expectations.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Fueled by glorious performances all-around, The Brothers Bloom is a film with art-house accents and a strong emotional heart.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> One of those movies that I wanted to see again the moment it was over -- and had this been anything other than a press screening where that was not possible, I would have.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> This globe-trotting romantic comedy is like going on a scavenger hunt where the fun is in the journey.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> It's as much about society's need for a well-told story as it is about an emotional connection between its characters. This sincerity is ultimately what lifts the picture above many of its predecessors.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> a confident and even touching bit of genre twisting, with its best moments providing plenty of anticipation for what else Johnson has up his sleeve
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's diverting for an hour or so, but one tires of all this forced playfulness long before the final reveal.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Rarely allowing substance to interfere with style, filmmaker Rian Johnson occasionally amuses but mostly frustrates with his con-job fantasia The Brothers Bloom.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Watching this movie is like being elbowed in the ribs for two consecutive hours.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> It's a fine movie to like, although nearly impossible to love. And from the man who gave us the immensely lovable Brick, this is a minor disappointment.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It probably takes a particular sensibility to really enjoy and appreciate The Brothers Bloom.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A fun, fast-paced and fashionable caper adventure, and a worthy homage to such classic thievery comedies as Topkapi.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The Brothers Bloom feels different from any crime caper you've ever seen, even though its machinations still revolve around con artists who play tricks on each other -- and the audience.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Many will point to the delirious preciosity of Wes Anderson's work as a reference point. I would suggest that even Anderson's recent work could use an injection of [Rian] Johnson's celluloid rapture.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Although it's got a strong cast and visual panache, Johnson willfully dispenses with the caper complications that might have made it more fun.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The Brothers Bloom jerks us around without end. The cons and twists pile up like debris. If The Brothers Bloom had one more twist I would have screamed.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> It's all a con, but thanks to Johnson's way with characters and dialogue, we don't mind the hustle so long as we're rewarded along the way.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Even if you don't quite comprehend the ending (there seem to be 12 of them), you'll still feel the wallop of its consequences.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> It's not blockbuster material, but this clever picture is a romantic -- and genuinely amusing -- charmer.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> What saves the day is Johnson's bold, bananas style, which is equal parts Fellini and Teletubby.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Ruffalo turns in another take on his soulful smart guy; Brody's all loosey-goosey charm (watch how he plays a harmonica, with his eyes lazily sliding over it); Weisz make something poetic from her ditsy yet forthright character.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> The leads have zero comedic skills, but you can tell they're being funny because they all wear sarcastic hats.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The dialogue is quick and funny, and so are the visuals. This is the sort of film in which the landscape is littered with unexpected and unbelievable people and events.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The writer-director builds on his tremendous gift for gab and fondness for intricate narratives.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> Johnson's script virtually floats, the sparkling words bubbling out at us with such frequency that we yearn to put the film on pause -- just to snatch an extra second in order to appreciate it all.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> These components add up to precious little in this precious affair too concerned with its look to say much worth listening to.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A globetrotting heist film that starts off terrifically and then progressively deflates.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A con game about con games, the second film from writer-director Rian Johnson is breezily enjoyable for about 10 minutes, until you realize the entire movie is going to be pitched at the same exuberantly manic pace.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Eat your heart out Wes Anderson. This film proves that Brick was not a fluke. The Brothers Bloom is an absolute joy to watch. Before it's over, your mouth will be sore from smiling.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Rian Johnson's direction is as self-conscious as his script, but, helped by winning performances from Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Weisz, it comes off as clever, even if the writing seems strained at times.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> That rare and wonderful thing: a movie lover's movie.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> This movie is lively at times, it's lovely to look at, and the actors are persuasive in very difficult material. But around and around it goes, and where it stops, nobody by that point much cares.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Johnson's already developing a visual sense with a bigger budget behind him, and his funny, romantic voice comes through in small ways throughout.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> I'll take a flawed, yet charming and clever film over a cookie cutter big budget flick almost any day of the week.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Scheduling blunders aside, this is worth seeking out because, despite its low profile, it offers the rarity of "summer fun" without the seemingly obligatory "dumb" appended to that descriptor.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> an invaluable primer on love, life, and blowing things up
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Here's the problem: Mark Ruffalo and Adrien Brody are not Paul Newman and Robert Redford. They'd like to be and the plot has undertones of 'The Sting.' But they aren't - and it isn't.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A brilliant, refreshingly original comedy that's delightfully zany and inventive.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Bloom is filled with first-rate scams, refreshing whimsy and incredibly well-layered performances, yet it aims to be something greater than simply another drop in the con-man bucket.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Imagine Dirty Rotten Scoundrels filtered through the increas ingly hermetically sealed sensibility of Wes Anderson, and you've got Rian Johnson's disappointing The Brothers Bloom.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> There's a tradition of cons in storytelling, yet not everyone can pull it off.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The unbridled energy and enthusiasm that Johnson and his cast are putting in would be better served by a story less rote, a con plot that at least pretends to be something new.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The "perfect" con job is the premise for this near-perfect con movie with a revelatory performance from Rachel Weisz.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Adventure and romance mix in bold, irreverent dramedy.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Ruffalo has some of the sharpest lines, and Brody's soulfulness is ideal for the role of a disillusioned introvert. With her enthusiasm, warmth and intelligence, Weisz is an inspired choice to play Penelope.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The irony is that outside of the manufactured oddities, Weisz's performance is the best thing in the movie: an old-school screwball turn of hypercurious pep.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> ... it's not important, but it's fun ...
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It's filled with hilarious, humdinger dialogue, imaginative images (I particularly like the fallen angel) and a pace that somehow embraces both energetic and deadpan.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Beyond that your response to the movie, which takes too conspicuous a delight in its own cleverness, is likely to be a shrug and a "so what?"
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> burns bright with brilliance before sputtering out in the end
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The central characters are not as compelling as they should be, and only Rachel Weisz makes a lasting impact. Despite their best efforts, Ruffalo and Brody are unable to transform their characters into figures worth caring about.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> There's a true filmmaking force at work here; open-minded film enthusiasts should appreciate [Johnson's] charming and unique approach to the heist comedy
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Witty and wilfully wacky, this offbeat adventure is good fun to watch, even if we can never quite get in sync with its peculiar rhythms.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.166666666667 <###> The Brothers Bloom reveals a limited formal artist who relies on cutesy montages and a Cat Stevens song to glom onto borrowed emotion.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Even if The Brothers Bloom winds up smothering itself with twee self-awareness, there's a certain jauntiness to the proceedings that keeps it aloft for most of its running time.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Combining the comic caper film with a calculatedly offbeat, Wes Anderson-inflected brand of drollery, the movie gets both modes wrong.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Mark Ruffalo's elaborate stings are so beautifully conceived that it is difficult to know where real life ends and make-believe begins.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> An awfully good time.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The four stars keep it a worthwhile watch.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The Brothers Bloom follows the rules of the con man genre well and for the most part is entertaining despite its random bits of lunacy and incomprehension.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The Brothers Bloom distills elements from films by the Coen brothers and Wes Anderson down into a wholly original, and hilarious, caper.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Hugely enjoyable, superbly written and impressively directed drama with terrific performances and a witty, offbeat script, though the ending is a little disappointing.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> If Rian Johnson took a page from Raymond Chandler for Brick, then it's one of Wes Anderson's eyes he's plucked out for his latest.
417267090 <###> The Brothers Bloom <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> With Brick Rian Johnson got me excited with his storyteller's tools; with The Brothers Bloom he used them to transport me. I loved being the mark in this con.

771354305 <###> A Haunted House 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> A Haunted House 2 occasionally tries to be a legitimate horror movie, but just like the comedy, it doesn't really work. Basically, this means you'll be hit with extremely generic jump scares every now and then.

13679 <###> The Legend of 1900 (La leggenda del pianista sull'oceano) <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> by every definition, a beautiful film: it's lovely to look at--and perhaps even moreso to listen to; and the acting is exquisite.
13679 <###> The Legend of 1900 (La leggenda del pianista sull'oceano) <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> A good-spirited fable ... it's the type of movie that either you'll love or you'll hate. Count me in the former category.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Admittedly, it's hard not to be affected.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Despite good acting from the two pairs, viewers expecting illuminating insights about the literary genius, eccentric philosophy and complex sexuality of Iris Murdoch will be disappointed by Richard Eyre's minor, rambling, TV-like film.

13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Iris fails to enlighten us into either the tragedy of Alzheimer's disease or the woman that it strikes.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> ... the film is cursory and shallow ...
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> [Winslet] is so utterly, fearlessly winning that she peels the arrogance off Iris, makes her shine with life strength.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> What should have been a stirring, deeply absorbing character study ... emerges instead as a facile, truncated work.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> [Eyre's] cinematic sensibility has a literary quality, as past and present become a seamless single entity.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> The performances by Dench, Broadbent and Winslet are impressive, but they dance around the hole at the movie's center, which is an understanding of Murdoch's writing.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> A virtual acting showcase.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> Two cannily coordinated pairs of actors effect a moving memoir of the late English author Iris Murdoch.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> [The] performances, if nothing else, embody a standard of excellence that Iris Murdoch herself would surely have cheered.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> The impoverished story keeps Iris from achieving greatness, but no qualifiers are needed for the acting.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> It almost seems as if Dench is not acting, such is the genius of her performance.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Passes judgement on a life without viewing many of its passages and attempts to discuss passion through a style of mirthless rigidity
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> The movie actually doesn't tell you much about Murdoch, who was a brilliant novelist, but it's an interesting study of love, semi-eccentric intellectuals and the passage of time.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> For a movie whose subject is the decline and fall of a towering intellect, there's precious little to think about here.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.82 <###> A moving, terribly sad, yet uplifting film that is carried to success by three wonderfully sensitive performances

13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> The performances are the raison d'etre...
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> Because the performances are so powerful, one nearly forgets that in its vaulting between the '50s and '90s, Iris is a story with a beginning and end but without a middle.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> A magnificent story about the enduring bond between two eccentric, astounding souls who somehow managed to find each other and hold on for dear life.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> Those who have had a loved one fall prey to the mental ravages of Alzheimer's will see in Iris a depiction that is so lucid and accurate that it may be painful to observe.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> Tune out the hype for countless other movies. This is the one to see.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> The performances in Iris -- by Judi Dench as the older Murdoch and Jim Broadbent as her husband, John Bayley, and by Kate Winslet as the younger Murdoch -- are so good that the film is completely compelling.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Because the film is well-acted and written with intelligence, it might be worth seeing, despite my objections.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> Iris glows with rightness and convinces us we're sharing its characters' understanding that when the books and the memory go, love can remain.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Represents everything that's stale about movie-making -- and especially movie awards -- today.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> The defining irony of the film is that like Dame Murdoch in the throes of her illness, Iris is lost, confused, and, perhaps most painfully, very occasionally brilliant.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> Iris sounds as if it would be painful to watch, and in scenes like the one described above, it can be. Yet watching love realistically depicted onscreen remains the greatest joy of film, and its most important gift to the world.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Feels unfinished, as if its many lovely parts have not come together into a meaningful whole.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Iris would appeal almost exclusively to existing fans of Murdoch's prose were it not for four truly compelling performances that meld seamlessly into one sublime whole.

13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> It creates a common mourning ground for all of us to reflect on this disease.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> It's good, but not great -- despite the heights to which Dench and Broadbent drive it. But those heights are lofty, the pain still stings.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> The brief running time and clinical atmosphere undermine the potentially poignant meditations.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> Kate Winslet and Judi Dench give wondrously in-sync performances...an inspired, invoking and inventive biography of one of Britain's premiere 20th Century authors.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Nice turns cannot make it feel like much more than a glacially-paced disease-of-the-week movie blown up to big screen size.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> Though Broadbent and Dench are very good ... it's Winslet and Bonneville who steal the show.

13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Rarely does a movie feel as leaden-footed as Iris, especially when it tries to bounce back and forth.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.9 <###> It's not only that Murdoch and Bayley had just that kind of kinship over the span of a 40-plus year marriage, it's that the actors manage an identically close and intimate relationship both to each other and to the characters they play.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> It's difficult to avoid nausean watching Jim Broadbent look with puppy eyes at Judi Dench throughout an otherwise literate--but too literary--film.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.9 <###> Two extraordinary performances anchor this generally sturdy adaptation of Elegy for Iris.
13676 <###> Iris <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Yes, that's Oscar knocking on Dench's door.

13675 <###> The Shipping News <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> The Shipping News isn't much of a breaking story, but its byline is hungry enough to be in the right place despite its convoluted convictions.
13675 <###> The Shipping News <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> The simple build of comedy and meticulous build of tragedy are missing and so, in effect, is the movie's heart.
13675 <###> The Shipping News <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Just as staple foods can sometimes be enjoyable, so this easy-to-digest, gently amusing drama is a pleasant way to fritter away a couple of hours.
13675 <###> The Shipping News <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> The Shipping News is brilliant, heartwarming, and divinely sublime as the cast delivers one helluva film!

13675 <###> The Shipping News <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Though the scenery is often breathtaking in its post-apocalyptic blight, Hallstrom's movie is as staid and impenetrable as the frozen loam on which he sets its foundation.

13675 <###> The Shipping News <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> A jumble of themes and fractured half-stories, none of which are never truly dealt with or fully developd.

13675 <###> The Shipping News <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> It's easier to respect than to love a movie almost totally lacking in conventional dramatic conflict, with almost all the characters seeming in dire need of antidepressants.
13675 <###> The Shipping News <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.3 <###> The nominally emotional moments feel unearned, partially because many of the book's edges and eccentricities have been softened.

13675 <###> The Shipping News <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> Hallstrom ... has always been excellent with scenery and ensemble casts, and Shipping News, besides its great Trinity Blight vistas, has another incredible ensemble.
13675 <###> The Shipping News <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> The kind of mundanely well-tuned movie designed for the singular purpose of winning undeserved Oscars.
13675 <###> The Shipping News <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> A schmaltzy snoozer.

771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> [The] deliberate structure demonstrates Ferrara's artfulness, as does the lush imagery.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> The film, a sleek and oddly moving study in the cost of debauchery, has its gleeful excesses.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Who better to play a world-class letch than Depardieu, whose Rabelaisian excesses on and off screen are legendary?
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> In an Abel Ferrara movie, this sort of damaged, raging, unrepentant bull passes for an antihero.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.375 <###> Circles a point about spiritual corruption without ever landing on it.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.375 <###> Grunting and boarlike, Gerard Depardieu supplies a one-note rendition of Dominique Strauss-Kahn in Abel Ferrara's peculiarly unilluminating "Welcome to New York."
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> With Depardieu's intensely physical performance at its core, Welcome To New York achieves a level of intimacy that's rare for films about public figures.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> The film's peculiarly exhilarating effect can be attributed to a sense of social outrage that's transcended for the sake of metaphoric social clarity.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> As Ferrera runs out of reported events to hang his story on, he spirals out of control into a dull and obvious climax.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Frustrante que um cineasta veterano como Ferrara exiba um interesse tao grande pelo sensacionalismo e pela exploracao de sua propria fantasia masculina quanto pela importante ideia que busca discutir.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> If you make it through [the first] half-hour of anonymous sex, you'll stumble into a fairly engrossing drama about a man brought down by his inability to control his urges
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Welcome to New York is depraved, confrontational and insidiously intriguing. Gerard Depardieu's electric performance needs to be seen to be believed.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The film largely comes across as a scabrous, semi-improvised cinematic art event, with a brazen streak of tabloid sensationalism.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Never mind the upcoming As Above, So Below or Ouija; this is the horror film of 2014.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Watching Gerard Depardieu's mostly naked performance in Welcome to New York is like being trapped beneath a vast, flabby Lucian Freud painting for two hours.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> It may be ageing provocateur Abel Ferrara's best film since King Of New York, but the film belongs to Depardieu. Like that painting of Kramer in Seinfeld, he is a loathsome, offensive brute, yet you can't look away.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Depardieu is uncompromising in his depiction of the physically and emotionally naked Devereaux as a loathsome monster governed by his appetites.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Despite an elemental focus, Ferrara has fashioned a casually complex moral tale.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The surface might seem chaotic, but beneath is structural precision. Shot with a maestro's skillset, Welcome to New York is worth it for the light show alone, Manhattan awash in morning gold, infernal red, inky small-hours blue.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> This is a brutal, occasionally inelegant film, but it pulls no punches and shines a stark, pitiless light on its subject.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Where are we going with this? There's almost nothing left to learn about Devereaux in the last hour that we haven't in the first.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> It's as if Ferrara's just chucked all the bits in the air and left us to deal with it ourselves - which is a surprisingly effective approach to the sort of material that could easily have made for a superficial and preachy movie.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> While the film revels in its naturalistic approach, regrettably the ending does become somewhat tedious, and we lose sight of the realism to some extent.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Welcome To New York will madden many but delight the Big Apple auteur's admirers.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Like Depardieu's let-it-all-hang-out performance, it exposes everything while revealing nothing.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Ferrara's film, compelling in bursts in its first half, proves taxing itself as it lumbers on.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> A film which says little of consequence beyond fictionalizing its target; only Bisset's Lady Macbeth-like presence hits an appropriately hysterical note for this tabloid-trashy film which quickly chokes on its pretensions.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Welcome to New York is squalid and joyless fare. Depardieu's performance doesn't achieve tragic grandeur but it is far more complex and moving than seemed remotely possible in the orgy scenes that open the movie.
771380387 <###> Welcome To New York <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> I watched the whole thing with my jaw on the floor.

17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Mary Harron asks what's more unnerving - exaggerated, imagined violence or vacuous realities some wish to be real, psychosis as much in the construct as the character. Thus, "Psycho's" savagery goes beyond a simple screed against 1980s excess and greed.
17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Harron' s incisive eye and Bale' s bravura performance carry the day.

17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Brett Easton Ellis' controversial and violent novel American Psycho is about as black as comedy gets, and Harron captures the tone and themes perfectly here, highlighting the vacuousness of 80s consumerism without pulling any punches at all.
17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> An uneven movie that nonetheless bristles with stinging wit and exerts a perverse fascination.
17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> If all of Ellis's characters more or less stay the same, Harron's film suggests that, like the '80s, Bateman to shall pass.

17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> It represents one of the most daring, inventive, and invigorating movies to reach the screen during the dreary first half of 2000.
17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Christian Bale is heroic in the way he allows the character to leap joyfully into despicability; there is no instinct for self-preservation here, and that is one mark of a good actor.

17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> What's best about the movie is the density of its satire. Its wry social commentary permeates every aspect of the filmmaking.

17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> It's so unique in its style, delivery, and execution that it's undoubtedly the most fascinating film to come along so far this year.

17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> A brilliant performance by Christian Bale can't quite keep this soulless movie afloat.
17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Well-filmed, well-acted and certainly riveting, American Psycho nonetheless is a movie without heart about a man without heart.

17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Unfortunately, director Mary Harron and screenwriter Guinevere Turner have also de-fanged the non-violent remainder of Ellis' free-floating narrative..
17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> As Bateman loses his tenuous grip on sanity, the filmmakers can't disguise the strain in Ellis' effort to make him an '80s Everyman who encapsulates every vile aspect of his culture.
17355 <###> American Psycho <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> As it nears a conclusion, the picture becomes almost as empty as the title character.

190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Despite the odd moment of visual bravura, this mockumentary is too aware of its own satirical daring. Consequently, it's never as dark, dangerous or amusing as it thinks.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Harry and Luke Treadaway give astonishing performances (or rather an astonishing performance), creating a believable physicality for their characters, as well as distinct personalities.

190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> It's the songs ... that give the movie its emotional ballast, countering the filmmakers' intellectualized approach and meta-narrative style.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Self-consciously strange and surprisingly haunting.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Apes the cinematic and musical excesses of its era so eerily that it's worth a look.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Here, at least, played straight, the mockumentary strictures are more like straitjackets.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> It's all the more frustrating when the film starts to feel draggy and repetitive, and then kind of sidesteps its own climax. But along the way it brims with joy and pain, discovery and oblivion. And that makes it well worth seeing.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Despite some excitingly shot concert footage, one scene begins to feel very much like the next, and it's all rather predictable.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Directors Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe, the duo who made the documentary Lost in La Mancha, turn the movie itself into a kind of conjoined twin: the silly and the grim are attached to each other at awkward angles.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> This is a very tender portrayal of young people caught up in a blisteringly fast and cynical world, and though their music is hideous, they are a compelling act.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> What could have been a powerful and poignant exploration of the British music biz ends up being merely above average.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> This is a fake documentary that barely lets on that it's fiction.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> The arc of the Howes' careers looks so much like the autopsies of similar 1970s rock bands that you brace yourself for the inevitable tragic end. And yet, even with the details of their demise more implied than stated, it still stings like real life.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The pace is slow, the story is slight, and the music is loud. I must not have been the filmmakers' intended audience.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Easily this summer's most disturbing film, the story of a glam band led by conjoined twins is remarkable for defying easy categorization and avoiding sensationalism of its easily exploitable subject, instead presenting a darkly bizarre yet tender tale.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's a delicate act to pull off and it may not all hang together perfectly, but it's impressive nonetheless.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> With Brothers of the Head, Fulton and Pepe have created a fiction film in the spirit of a rock doc, further blurring... the line between live and Memorex.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Wields its carnival sideshow story about a Siamese twins-fronted '70s British glam band not for parodic silliness but, rather, for surprisingly tender, haunting melodrama.
190816443 <###> Brothers of the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> This dark and sometimes blackly humorous drama, told cinema verite style, is of a different intent, and miles away from the type of comedy normally associated with that word.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Daniel Day-Lewis is remarkable.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> At every point, Day-Lewis is at the center of the story, and he carries the film with an impassioned performance. It helps that it's a great part.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Day-Lewis, so intricately repressed in The Age of Innocence, here offers a role reversal in an unreserved and emotional performance that throws caution and inhibition to the winds.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The complicated relationship between the rebellious Gerry and the quietly tormented Giuseppe is one focus of the film. The obvious political implications of the dreadful situation are another.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> This is a stirring and exceptionally well acted, though controversial, dramatisation of Gerry Conlon's book about the grave miscarriage of justice suffered by the Guildford Four.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Sheridan takes a controversial subject and gives it wider appeal by focusing on the family drama of two men who are also political prisoners.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Letter-perfect performances from Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite do a lot more than a dozen editorials to make an unforgettable point about the miscarriage of justice.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> I miss Day-Lewis in films.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Sheridan fails to illuminate the evils the film is meant to condemn. Never has injustice been so boring.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> A first-rate legal drama, unjustly forgotten in the ten years since its release.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> [Day-Lewis] proves here once again that he is one of the most talented and interesting actors of his generation.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> For me, the film only had a few good parts, but these were so outstanding that I give it thumbs up, and rated it ** 1/2.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> It is an injection into a society at war, Northern Ireland and England in the Seventies and a compelling account of a son and father making their peace.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Most of the way ... this is rousing stuff, and the performances -- especially those by Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite -- are definitely Oscar-caliber.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> This film, although still being good, had capacity to be really great.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Impeccably acted and efficiently directed.
13519 <###> In the Name of the Father <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> The brilliance of Jim Sheridan's motion picture is that we come to view every event from the perspective of how it impacts on the relationship between Gerry and his father, in whose name the final struggle is fought.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.8 <###> Stop-motion comedy adventure with subtitles, a few curses.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.5 <###> full review at Movies for the Masses
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.4 <###> Charming and highly original but a little of it goes a long way.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.4 <###> Though it probably works best in short bursts on DVD, it might just be wacky and strange enough to appeal to kids who'll simply accept it for what it is.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.9 <###> Chaotic, warped and impervious to logic ? a total treasure just waiting to be discovered.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.4 <###> A very small amount of this would be funny. But here, there's 77 minutes of it. And that's about 76 minutes and 30 seconds too much to stomach in one sitting.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 1.0 <###> Bounces around with a hyperactive dementia that somehow never flags.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.8 <###> Studded with surreal and unexpectedly tender touches (kamikaze cows, an elegantly lovestruck horse), this is plastic and fantastic.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.6 <###> Like a very lo-fi Toy Story with the vibe of a live-action Terry Gilliam cartoon and the addled craziness of SpongeBob SquarePants; it's funny for adults and children alike in a refreshing, barking mad sort of way.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.6 <###> A heady and utterly unapologetic roller-coaster ride into a hyper-vivid, hyperactive world created from cheap children's toys.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.8 <###> One of the year's originals -- frantic, unpredictable and very, very funny. Remove brain. See loud.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.6 <###> If someone laced Wallace and Gromit's stockpile of West Country cheeses with hallucinogens, they might start to show some of the free-associative abandon of the characters in this trippy debut feature...
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.6 <###> The action sometimes overrides the subtitles, but children of all ages could well be mesmerised just trying to keep up with the accident-prone story of Cowboy, Indian and Horse.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.8 <###> Directors Stephane Aubier and Vincent Patar (who also provide voices) display a pleasantly warped sensibility without going for adult humor.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.8 <###> Aubier and Patar would have us believe that Panic really can be reduced to child's play, which just makes it seem all the more like a place worth visiting.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.625 <###> Make no mistake about it, Panic has some merits. It's unlike anything currently being done in the animation realm. Unfortunately, it lacks the playfulness and endearing qualities of its clay-animated kin...
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> Town looks deliberately crude, so much so that it takes a while to realize just how cleverly it has been animated. Ditto for the humor, which at first smacks of childlike chaos and then segues into subversive sophistication.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.8 <###> Charming low-tech absurdism, free of irony and full of escalating stakes, situations, hilarity, and charm.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.25 <###> I watched A Town Called Panic without the assistance of any controlled substances, and that might be why I hated it.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> If you've ever seen anything like A Town Called Panic, you either made it yourself or you dreamed it.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> All the silliness unfolds in a complex social structure, where good manners are expected, bad behaviour is punished and birthdays are not to be forgotten.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> In a world lousy with computer animation and 3-D whizz-bangery -- j'accuse, James Cameron! -- it's nice to know there's still fun to be had with nothing more than plastic figures and a little imagination.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.7 <###> With animation like this it is no wonder kids develop ADD. The current generation of Python influenced animation talent comes to a screen near you.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.9 <###> Off the wall from the outset, A Town Called Panic is a riot of delightful, cockeyed whimsy and a truly wonderful piece of animation.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.6 <###> Made with an anarchic, anything-goes spirit, this is truly a film, not to mention a town, where you never know what's going to happen next.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.5 <###> A Town Called Panic feels more like some exotic animated curiosity than a film to return to again and again.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> It may put you in mind of silent comedies and freewheeling animators of the past like Chuck Jones.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> Pleasing to look at, Panic intentionally resembles an amateur, stop-motion project, but one can't watch it without being amazed at the extraordinary effort involved in putting together a movie like this, a few frames at a time.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.875 <###> Stop-motion at its messiest and nuttiest.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.875 <###> A Town Called Panic is a proudly Calvinist work -- I mean the comic strip character, not the philosopher -- that understands the delights of deep play.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.875 <###> So this is what deadpan slapstick surrealist Belgian stop-motion animation looks like. I like it!
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.5 <###> Absurdity is supposed to carry the day in this fantastical satire of rural life, but the film's material is too mild and its bag of tricks (flurries of motion and noise followed by pauses of stillness and silence) too repetitive.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.9 <###> An exercise in pure gag logic... 75 solid minutes of non-stop absurd imagery and slapstick.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.875 <###> Because the plot is just one doggoned thing after another without the slightest logic, there's no need to watch it all the way through at one sitting. If you watch it a chapter or two at a time, it should hold up nicely.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.8 <###> A Town Called Panic is an adventure story as fast-paced and exciting as any currently in theaters.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.85 <###> A refreshingly zany, clever, funny and truly bizarre comedy of errors that will delight audiences, young and old.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> It's almost consistently amusing, if never quite laugh-out-loud funny.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.4 <###> If you want more crass parody, and more creative use of action figures, check out Robot Chicken
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> It's silly, of course, but also wildly inventive and oddly adult.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> The film posits an endlessly malleable universe whose objects can be remade nearly as fast as they're destroyed.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.9 <###> A deliriously wild and totally charming ride from start to finish, as Cowboy, Indian and Horse charge all over the world in a whimsical assault of fun.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 1.0 <###> [A] goofy, hilarious stop-motion fable.
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 1.0 <###> An amazing head trip, a glorious journey right inside a semi-innocent imagination
770815842 <###> Panique au village (A Town Called Panic) <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Art House & International <###> 0.2 <###> 0.4 <###> 0.6 <###> 0.75 <###> 1.0 <###> If a precocious 9-year-old with attention deficit issues made a stop-motion animated movie, he might produce a triumph of supreme silliness like A Town Called Panic.
771352536 <###> Rescue in the Philippines <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.872 <###> Riveting and vital.
771352536 <###> Rescue in the Philippines <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Although it runs just under an hour, the gripping documentary "Rescue in the Philippines: Refuge From the Holocaust" proves a thorough look at a lesser-known chapter in Holocaust-era history.
771352536 <###> Rescue in the Philippines <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Recounts a little-known chapter of World War II heroism that is as heartbreaking as it is courageous.
770694162 <###> Close Call <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.2 <###> Silly, often unintentionally hilarious potboiler.
771349818 <###> Nosotros los Nobles <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Director/co-writer Gaz Alazraki proves to be adept at juggling earnest sentiment and more raucous laughs.
771252645 <###> Sons of Norway <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Funny, heart-warming and original tale of turbulent adolescence in 1970s Oslo.
771207058 <###> Legacy: Black Ops <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> ... the director has a good eye and a great lead actor to pull Legacy through.
771207058 <###> Legacy: Black Ops <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> As a showpiece for Elba, the movie functions well, and will probably be regarded mainly for being just that.
771207058 <###> Legacy: Black Ops <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Featuring plenty of visceral thrills and presented with more intelligence than many of the thrillers which spring from Hollywood strafing cliche bullets to little effect, it suggests everyone concerned is destined for bigger, better things in the future.
771207058 <###> Legacy: Black Ops <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> A complex character study brought to absorbing, haunting life through the fierce commitment of its acting and filmmaking.
771207058 <###> Legacy: Black Ops <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Aspiring for psychological drama rather than action movie, the film takes itself far too seriously.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.2 <###> Overlong and astonishingly self-indulgent.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> While the central thesis, that truth can only be told through fiction, is sound ("real truth and justice" having become "just a popularity contest"), this remains too clumsily schematic to get beneath the surface of its subject.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The Face of an Angel is a fascinating but perplexing film, which typifies its director's offbeat approach to whatever subject matter he tackles.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Winterbottom gives a righteous and enjoyable savaging to the media-workers for whom the murder of a young woman means firstly a meal ticket, and then good fodder for dinner-party chatter.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Invests sobriety and pathos into the consideration of a genuine tragedy, and identifies Kercher as its angel.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> By taking a fictionalised approach to the Meredith Kercher murder case in Italy, filmmaker Michael Winterbottom sets out to show how tricky it is to find the truth in any case...
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> [An] intelligent and surprisingly sensitive meditation on the way our society and its various media react to violent crime.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.2 <###> It is shallow and glib, and Bruhl's fantasies and nightmares lead to some terrible tonal misjudgments and wrong notes.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Dramatically underwhelming. Doesn't really feel like there's a film here.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> On one level a fascinating refraction of the Amanda Knox trial into an examination of perception, on another an increasingly trying hall of mirrors.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The Face of an Angel turns circles without really getting anywhere, the work of a filmmaker getting bogged down first in the vagaries of the modern media and the Italian criminal court system, then in his own personal and professional difficulties.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The Face of an Angel ties itself up in some strange knots, but Michael Winterbottom conjures up a haunting gothic atmosphere in Siena.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> You can sense the director's struggle here, wrestling with how to take on such a story. Like Thomas, you suspect he started out with a very different film in mind; the problem is, what he's ended up with is a mixed bag.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Michael Winterbottom can't solve the murder of Meredith Kercher, but what he can do is reveal philosophical truths that go way beyond guilt and innocence, and it makes for some wonderfully smart stuff.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> The depiction of the creative process far too tedious and pretentious to illuminate anything meaningful about the way fiction and reality intersect.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> An intriguing and well-constructed but ultimately less than riveting fictionalised account of events inspired by the Amanda Knox trial.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> [Winterbottom] defuses the material, in what feels more like a rough draft than a final cut.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Nonetheless the film is carried by a sense of mystery, sex and the unanswered questions of the case.
771387801 <###> The Face Of An Angel <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> There are lots of things to recommend about this film.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Top Five is Chris Rock's latest slice of personal comedy, except New York is the stage and echoes of Woody Allen, Louie C.K, Adam Sandler and Jerry Seinfeld abound.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> The time has arrived to finally come out and say that...Chris Rock is a mediocre film director...Given how perceptive, confronting and challenging his stand up work is, it's disappointing to see how tame Rock becomes when he gets behind the camera.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Benefits from Rock fully exploiting his own persona and his own conflicted experiences of being a famous, rich African American performer.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It doesn't always work, there are plenty of scenes you wish were better, but it's out there.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The incomparable Chris Rock is not known for impersonations, but he mimics Woody Allen, Richard Linklater, Louis C.K. and even Federico Fellini in his directorial pet project Top Five.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The writing here feels like vintage Rock: free-flowing, profane and absolutely hilarious.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> While Top Five is certainly Rock's best work as a filmmaker, it's also proof that he shouldn't quit his day job yet.

771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Chris Rock's Top Five is very funny -- no surprise there -- but it's also unexpectedly romantic.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> [Rock's] conversations with Dawson crackle with intelligence and sexual chemistry, and a parade of guest artists -- some playing characters, others as themselves -- is folded into the mix with a minimum of awkwardness.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> As a director, Chris Rock makes a fine stand-up comic.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> When it feels loose and lived-in, it starts clicking into place. But when it pushes its characters toward unearned saccharine, it feels as fake as the industry it's supposed to be satirizing.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Rock is sharpest in observational mode, riffing on Andre's career, but the movie falters when the routine plot devices kick in.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Top Five is easily the "Avengers" of comedians where the laugh meter never drops from its highest point.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Chris Rock has made an entertainment that is not only a wild and rich study of his lead character but the character of the filmmaker himself.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> A clever, laff-a-minute adventure worth the investment for the hilarity, even if it telegraphs where the love story might be headed.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> I think I would still rather watch Rock hold a press conference about "Top Five" than actually act in it, but the movie is the nearest we've come to hearing Rock's authentic comic voice on film.

771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Top Five is the film that bridges the gap between the creator's on-screen and stage personas. Skillfully dancing the line between harsh and hopeful, Rock delivers his medicine with a delicious spoonful of honey.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Very funny, yes, but it also represents a clear statement from Rock about his career. It's his best film by a considerable margin.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> It's a big leap forward for Rock as both an actor and a filmmaker, written and directed with the nervous, live-wire energy that has eluded his on-screen work for so long.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The settings for conversation are awfully contrived, but wow, are those conversations good.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> The best comedy of the year.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> A seriously funny, semi-autobiographical film that might be the most accomplished work Chris Rock has ever done for the big screen.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Top five thoughts that crossed my mind as I watched Top Five.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Rock is incisive in this new comedy but the film's reliance on crude and unfunny set-ups really prevents it from reaching the heights it's aiming for.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> When it comes to comedy, funny always wins, and Chris Rock's third directorial effort does run on engagingly amusing riffs. But Top Five also steers hard into undisciplined storytelling...
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Top Five is Rock's greatest accomplishment yet, mixing his signature brand of comedy with a hip and savvy filmmaking technique borrowed from some of cinema's finest.

771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Like Rock's best stand-up shows, Top Five mixes the sweet with the salty, the naughty with the remarkably kind. It celebrates the darkly hilarious with the light of whip-smart observations.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Full of uneven drama but where is the comedy!
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Top Five finds Rock in an elevated form, at 49. Things change, sometimes for the better.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Ragged around the edges and haphazardly hilarious though it may be, "Top Five" ultimately satisfies as an often raunchy ramble about celebrity, sobriety, selling out and sex, courtesy of the immensely talented but too-often subpar movie star Chris Rock.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Here are the Top Five reasons Chris Rock's latest deserves little of the hype it's receiving.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Among Chris Rock's films, this is more than in the top five. It is number one.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Welcome back, Chris Rock.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> An innovative take on familiar material, Top Five is an exquisitely paced, rich, idiosyncratic, satirical, yet deeply moving free-form comedy about a Hollywood star who is shadowed for one day by a New York Times reporter.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Rock's brilliant skewering of Hollywood, celebrities and the fans obsessed with their every move results in one of the year's smartest, insightful and terrifically funny films of the year.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> [T]he film has a lot to say about the nature and perils of fame, and it does so with Rock's observant and caustic humor.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It's a slap-happy movie and often scurrilously funny - the sound of a gifted comic mind finally finding its onscreen voice.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The movie, which alternates between hilariously vulgar gags and some electric improvs and riffs by Rock and his cast of all-stars, has the crackle and pop of a live performance - it energizes you.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Combining the best of Woody Allen and his own particular urban perspective, Rock has come up with one of the funniest films of 2014.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Rock is on a roll again.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It can be delightful, intelligent, crude, clumsy and culturally tone-deaf, depending on which scene is rolling by. One minute it's a major letdown, the next minute a joy to watch.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Raunchy in extremis, often funny and at times touching, "Top Five" is Chris Rock's sincere attempt to craft a film career largely detached from his stand-up clowning.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> The sweetest surprise in this raunchy comic ride is how artfully Rock lets down his guard. His confident, prowling wit as a stand-up has finally found its way to the screen, enhanced by a bracing vulnerability.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.86 <###> Rock lets his humor play broadly, but he fills out the space between gags with smart writing and pointed social insights.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Top Five entertains more than any previous film in which Rock was top-billed primarily because its content as well plays like an extension of Rock's stand-up act.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> "Top Five" may be Chris Rock's biggest and boldest film as a director and writer, but a sharper, smarter, realer script would have made it far more than just a lazy, lightweight laughfest.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Top Five is Rock's most accomplished work yet, a truly personal story whose comedic riffs on love, race, sex, and celebrity are carefully woven into a credible romantic plot.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> "Top Five" has the bright, high-gloss feel of the most delicious wish-fulfillment fantasies, but it derives its spiky, propulsive energy from the adamantly forthright figure at its center.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> In "Top Five," you sense Rock trying to load all these disparate talents onto a conventional romantic-comedy structure. It's a close call, but it holds.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Rock is too nimble and original to fall back on Hollywood conventions here. He uses this plot as a springboard for a manic ride through several days in Andre's nutty, combustible life.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> What lingers hours later aren't just the laughs but the people.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> With "Top Five," Rock has finally made the transition to true movie stardom.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The semi-autobiographical nature of Rock's film makes Top Five's satiric points about black performers in the entertainment industry fall all the more precisely.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> "Top Five" is a funny movie, but Rock has his sights set higher than lowbrow, and for the most part, he succeeds.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Rock's ambitious passion project - he wrote, directed and stars in it - is a bawdy, uninhibited yet thoughtful social satire about fame vs. artistic fulfillment.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It paints with a broad brush... but the journey is nonetheless entertaining, and at times wildly funny.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> An introspective look at stardom that happens to be the funniest movie of the year.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Funnier than it is smart.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Rock's fast-talking rhythms are all over this movie, and they lift it up; it's like dropping in on a party full of funny people, and leaving before the evening fades.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Just when it seemed like Chris Rock had already done plenty for the culture, along comes his latest work as a writer and director, "Top Five." And it's one of the most vibrant, sly romantic comedies this year.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Even when it falls flat, Top Five has ambition, which is more than you could say about the majority of Rock's previous film work.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> As an actor, Rock doesn't create much of a spark with Dawson, and as a director, he tends to let scenes go on too long.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> You'll likely leave the theater smiling. And when's the last time you cold say that about a Chris Rock movie?
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> A relentlessly filthy and unbearably entertaining crowd-pleaser that actually needs to be seen in a theater with a lathered-up group.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> On the surface, a lost-artist comedy in the vein of Woody Allen's Stardust Memories, but more deeply, a referendum on the dead-end choices Rock himself might be feeling.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> It's a comedy with a serious side - and yet it feels completely natural when it suddenly segues into over-the-top set pieces (including one fairly surreal stretch in Houston involving Cedric the Entertainer you can't un-see).
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> This is the movie I've been waiting for Chris Rock to make his entire career. It's his stand-up sensibility, perfectly translated to film.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Funny...but unfortunate coincidences? Police brutality, a black man in a choke hold, a comic singing the praises of Bill Cosby, a man acting as if he doesn't "get" rape, and the reminder that this might be the last time we see Tracy Morgan in a movie
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Top Five is a fiercely honest and very funny passion project for Chris Rock that works best when it channels the comic actor's brazen energy.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> As a social satirist, Chris Rock adroitly balances bawdy abrasiveness with the awareness of a black man blindsided by his own success.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Chris Rock never loses sight of the laughs for his most personal film yet.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Rock spins his familiarity with the industry to get goofy and hilarious results, but as the day progresses he surprises us with an overwhelming sense of vulnerability and pain - an aspect of the business often taken for granted.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The somewhat watchable vibe lasts up until the movie enters its hopelessly misguided third act...
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Could go toe-to-toe with the very best of Rock's standup. The movie he's been working towards his entire career.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Top Five is a film broad and filthy enough for multiplex appeal, but also sufficiently arch to satisfy those who fancy themselves a little more sophisticated.
771387806 <###> Top Five <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> I stopped writing off Rock as a filmmaker when he swerved left to remake an Eric Rohmer movie...
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> ...at its best when the story and period trappings serve Lynch's vision, and vice versa.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> This stylish, poignant drama is probably the closest director David Lynch has got to the mainstream outside of the disastrous Dune.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The playing is finely judged, the black-and-white cinematography is effective and the whole thing manages to be truly moving in a way that overcomes all the "I am not an animal!" schmaltz.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Heartbreaking drama isn't for sensitive viewers.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> A moving, faithful retelling of a bizarre true story.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> One of the year's best films. Only DeNiro could take the Oscar away from John Hurt.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> In this follow-up to the amazing Eraserhead, David Lynch exposes undercurrents of anguish along with an emotionally accessible tale of Merrick's nobility--a Victorian morality play disguised as an elegy to freakishness
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 0.92 <###> Has the look and texture of an authentic document, elevated by the hand of a artist with a singular vision
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> This black-and-white film already includes several Lyncian benchmarks: hissing noises, nightmare sequences, and moments of deadly quiet.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Perhaps Lynch's finest moment -- Both disturbingly odd and surprisingly humane.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> David Lynch does a neat turn with a straight drama.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Spectacular
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> I kept asking myself what the film was really trying to say about the human condition as reflected by John Merrick, and I kept drawing blanks.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 0.91 <###> The Elephant Man is a memorable film about human survival and a powerful commentary on human exploitation.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Beautifully acted and photographed in absolutely gorgeous wide-screen black-and-white, the results are rarely less than stunning, despite the lapses into the melodramatic.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> My apologies to the fans of the absurd, but I'd call this David Lynch's one true masterpiece.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Avoids the obvious traps of simple romanticism and playing into sheer pity for Merrick's noble plight.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> This tale of a pure soul struggling to be heard over the prejudice of the many is quite heart-rending.
10377 <###> The Elephant Man <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Understated and masterful in its use of costumes, makeup, and low-budget camerawork, David Lynch's portrait of John The Elephant Man Merrick stands as one of the best biographies on film.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> The tension between grandfather and father and son is so fabricated and baseless that the film just kind of shrugs it off, like a coat it thought it should wear because that's what all the other gritty urban crime dramas are wearing these days.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.45 <###> There's about an hour's worth of story in the The Forger, a languid movie that's stretched thin to fill out the running time.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> It never for a single moment makes a plausible case for its own existence.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> Occasionally a movie comes along that's such an awkward compilation of ideas it fascinates: The Forger, a Boston-set melodrama involving cancer, Impressionist art and deadbeat dads, is only about half that good.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> This limply directed tale emerges as a case study of an all too familiar type of art crime: the making of bad movies.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> As the film's title suggests, there is something inauthentic about it all.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Scenes generally feel underdeveloped, and transitions abrupt. A suspicion grows that this is one movie that would have fared better as miniseries.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> The movie is miscast and predictable, but it's not entirely without merit.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Tragically for the film's momentum, there's no sense of drama or tension to the heist.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The Forger proves to be a completely counterfeit crime thriller.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> Travolta's face looks immobile, while Plummer and Jennifer Ehle, as Cutter's estranged, strung-out wife, look out of place.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> John Travolta wearily plays a master art forger who undertakes the proverbial "one last job" for the benefit of his dying son in Philip Martin's soggy, strictly by-the-numbers crime thriller.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> We always knew Travolta's laziness as an actor would catch up with him.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> A sluggish, obvious fusion of a disease-of-the-week tearjerker with a comedic family crime romp that abounds in stiflingly over-emphasized Boston-crime-movie details.
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> ...a misguided piece of work...
771387809 <###> The Forger <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Good performances can't save a bland, instantly forgettable film.
771030813 <###> Thirst <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> ...an uneven yet passable horror effort.
15183 <###> Devil in the Flesh <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> As bad as the movie gets (which, to be fair, isn't THAT bad), Rose McGowan holds it together on at least a 'watchability' level. 'Believability' is another story.
770768799 <###> Limbo <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Proximate politics replaced by archetype and what Wordsworth would have called "the story of place."
770768799 <###> Limbo <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Sayles cheats the viewer with an ending that might have looked enigmatic on another film, but looks like a cop-out on this one.
770768799 <###> Limbo <###> Drama <###> 0.375 <###> It delivers its name's sake. If limbo is your idea of fun -- you'll have a riot.
770768799 <###> Limbo <###> Drama <###> 0.2 <###> I've never heard such booing in a theater in all my life.
770768799 <###> Limbo <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> A gimmick that is less clever than it is fatally distracting.
771371405 <###> Cas & Dylan <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The story ends up being one wrong turn after another. A GPS hasn't been invented that could get this plot-hole-riddled script back on track.
771371405 <###> Cas & Dylan <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Former heart-throb Jason Priestley, making his feature debut as director, keeps the banter ticking along nicely as the bug transports us to a sentimental -- but genuinely touching -- conclusion.
771371405 <###> Cas & Dylan <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> The film simply mucks up its earnest take on the buddy movie with undercooked characters and on-the-nose writing.
771371405 <###> Cas & Dylan <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> ...an earnest yet underwhelming endeavor that's hardly a cut above most garden-variety made-for-television enterprises...
771371405 <###> Cas & Dylan <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Cas & Dylan may have big-name talent for a small Canadian movie but mainly it has tired Hollywood formulas.
771371405 <###> Cas & Dylan <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Screenwriter Jessie Gabe has a few surprises up her sleeve, particularly at the end.
771371405 <###> Cas & Dylan <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Even if Cas & Dylan isn't as polished as it could be, there are still enough pleasing moments to make this road trip worth the ride.
771367699 <###> Barbie and Her Sisters in a Pony Tale <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> Barbie and her sisters have sweet, magical Swiss adventure.
771367699 <###> Barbie and Her Sisters in a Pony Tale <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> A respectable outing for the doll-turned-star, but an overly familiar plot, along with animation that doesn't have the same "wow" factor as the Fairytopia film released earlier this year, make it a middle-of-the-road entry in the series.
770672317 <###> Tsui Hark's Vampire Hunters (The Era of Vampires) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.25 <###> Most disappointing is Hark franchising his name before the sell-by date has expired on his own filmmaking career.
770672317 <###> Tsui Hark's Vampire Hunters (The Era of Vampires) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.6 <###> I loves me a good kung fu zombie vampire action horror comedy flick, and Vampire Hunters delivers.
770672317 <###> Tsui Hark's Vampire Hunters (The Era of Vampires) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.2 <###> Murky, third-rate martial-arts film.
770672317 <###> Tsui Hark's Vampire Hunters (The Era of Vampires) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.375 <###> The thrill is mostly gone in this supernatural mess.
770672317 <###> Tsui Hark's Vampire Hunters (The Era of Vampires) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.5 <###> Pleasantly cheesy but undistinguished martial-arts and horror fare.
770672317 <###> Tsui Hark's Vampire Hunters (The Era of Vampires) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.3 <###> It's more silly than scary and relies excessively on surprisingly low-rent CGI effects and crude wirework to drum up interest in the slight story.
770672317 <###> Tsui Hark's Vampire Hunters (The Era of Vampires) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Sports & Fitness <###> 0.8 <###> The film's action sequences have been staged with a dazzling finesse, and the look of the film is splendid.
771380298 <###> Love at First Fight <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> French film about two adventuresome youth who go into training for the end of the world
771380298 <###> Love at First Fight <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Though amicable and funny, it might disappoint those expecting a film more ambitious and layered from the praise of the [Directors' Fortnight] jury.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The end result is an overlong adaptation that primarily comes off as a complete and total misfire...
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Affleck is great here.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> An excellent film which takes some big, brave steps in the crime genre...
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> full review at Movies for the Masses
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Casey Affleck delivers a chilling performance as a sociopathic deputy sheriff whose charming veneer shatters as we're introduced to his taste for violence of both the straight-up and sexual kinds.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> [Affleck's] commitment to such a vile character, even in spite of Winterbottom's occasionally questionable direction, displays a fearlessness that is rarely seen in cinema today.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> The violence is not shown in an ironic fashion. It's put front and center and is visceral in a way nothing else is in the film.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Dark thriller centers on brutal violence against women.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> It's Winterbottom's first entry into dark noir, and I think a more seasoned hand in the genre would have given Lou's horrible actions their proper moral weight.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> Viewers are invited to spend these torpid minutes burrowing into Lou's back story in search of reasons why he is off his rocker. But this is one movie psycho that defies all amateur psychoanalysis.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Winterbottom's film is really rather down beat and hard to take. Perhaps that's only just so. Lou's heart of darkness takes us to a dead end. It's the kind of violent movie where you just want all the bloody mayhem to stop.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> It's a violent film about violence, but that makes it truthful.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> Sex and violence take centre stage in the enthralling, if a little overcooked crime thriller, The Killer Inside Me.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.9 <###> This is compelling and challenging cinema, punctuated with genuinely shocking moments, by a director and a cast of actors who are right at the top of their game.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Sometimes works, sometimes scores a near-hit and sometimes doesn't work at all, but is invariably fascinating throughout.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> A vast miscalculation.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> One of the most repellent and reprehensible movies in recent memory.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> uneven, but fascinatingly nasty adaptation of Thompson's 1952 novel
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> It's a fine idea to turn Affleck's squawky self-assurance into a lens on sociopathy, but Winterbottom and co-writer John Curran seem neither to examine nor to indulge, and the result feels strangely inconsequential.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.65 <###> Like much of Winterbottom's genre-hopping, this venture into dusty western noir fits him surprisingly well the first time he slips it on; though it could still do with a few alterations.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> What a crock.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Feminists, look away now.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Little, however, can save The Killer Inside Me from its worst impulses, its reveling in brute violence that makes it hard to watch and nearly impossible to admire, even though it's carefully crafted.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> Casey Affleck is suprisingly good as Ford.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> This is a work of stylish, existentialist brutality, filled with beautiful women and damaged men.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> As for the misogynist brutality, it is indeed depraved, made more so by the fact that its female victims are depicted as loving their abuse right up until it turns murderous.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> It's an intriguing more-than-meets-the-eye experiment in point of view.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Director Michael Winterbottom... projects such profound disinterest in the material that even the most appalling moments come across through a thick layer of gauze and insipidness.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> To his credit, Affleck avoids making Lou suggest a reboot of Robert. He's pushy and cowardly, but in a more calculating way, and he's sadistically sexual in a way that Robert never was.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> It's a psychologically haunting portrait of an extreme personality, an amoral, violent, lonely man.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> The film, sunbaked noir delivered with disturbing savagery and finesse, does its source material full justice.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Jim Thompson might be the darkest of noir writers, but Michael Winterbottom's version of Thompson's 1952 novel reduces its mirthful nihilism to lurid unpleasantness.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Full of nice little touches, but somehow misses the mark when it comes to the big picture.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> It comes across like a remake of Russ Meyer's immortal "Supervixens" made by people who have inexplicably chosen to play it both straight and at the wrong speed.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> Winterbottom has crafted a handsome film about the ugliness of the worst of human nature and, in the process, given us a fascinating dissection of genre mechanics.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> A classic crime novel is given an adaptation that pulls no punches
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Winterbottom was right to keep the light and compositions flat and bright and eerily sunny, no matter what sort of evilness Lou perpetrates. But the story should grow progressively more reckless-seeming and feverish; instead, it is methodical to a fault.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Little more than torture porn tricked out in art-house finery.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> A disappointment, even if you're intrigued by the phrase 'Rough sex with Jessica Alba.'
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> There is a point beyond which Lou's implacability brings diminishing returns. While I admire Affleck's performance, I believe Winterbottom and his writer, John Curran, may have miscalculated.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Affleck's Lou Ford is a fascinating character, and it's interesting to watch his mental and emotional journey.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> It's one thing on the page, where you're almost as horrified by the idea of some person actually writing this as you are by what you're reading. But on the screen, actually watching it happen, it begins to fall apart.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> John Curran's script can be faulted for leaning too heavily on the childhood roots of Lou's psychosis, but the movie does Thompson proud. It's a scorcher.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> The Killer Inside Me is hard to watch -- occasionally impossible to watch -- but it never looks away from the hard, isolate, stoic killer at its dark heart, and it makes sure we can't either.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> You may feel a twinge of sympathy for this monster, a strange and vivid character who deserves all the torments of hell, and also a better movie.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> There's no resonance, only impact.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Raspy-voiced Affleck turns in an amazingly controlled performance as a natural-born killer, with strong backup from the supporting cast.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Affleck is playing someone split down the middle, but we're stuck seeing only one side of him.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> captures Thompson's pulp brutality and delivers it without any varnish of fantasy or cinematic trickery
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> No movie for old men, or any other demographic for that matter.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> An adequate if unexceptional film noir throwback becomes something altogether less tolerable in its brutal depictions of ... violence against women.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Winterbottom's inability to bring off this lurid stew of sex and violence is one problem; his (mis)direction of Affleck is another.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.85 <###> Winterbottom delves into Coen Brothers territory and delivers one of his best-looking movies as well as one that's far more cinematic than what we've normally seen from him.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> The result isn't drama so much as a waking nightmare of play-acting and predestined doom.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Even though the one sustained sequence of violence has already caused controversy, possibly more than it deserves, this Killer is stylish and convincing.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> This is not a film that lets you off the hook or allows you to avert your eyes. Commendable in its own way but not something I would rush to recommend.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Winterbottom's harsh, naturalistic approach pretty much kills any dramatic momentum or tension by exposing the mechanics of Thompson's pulpy plotting for what it is and failing to compensate with any real psychological insights.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> The Killer Inside Me undoubtedly touches upon compelling subjects, but having done so, doesn't appear to know quite what to do next.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> It didn't always work for me,but this is one of Winterbottom's most ambitious films, and it's good to see that he's continuing to stretch himself.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Stylish, sweatily seductive and boasts career-best performances from the leads. It's just let down by a plot that runs out of steam 40 minutes before the end.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> A baffling film. Not just the narrative, but the motives behind making it.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> This is, for long stretches, a listless, meandering film that's not helped by Affleck's deliberately introverted, almost opaque performance.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> If the climax undermines the sociological purpose of the journey into the dark side of the loon, you'll never forget Lou Ford's personal descent into hell.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> Here is a film whose subject is violence's human and inhuman toll -- and violence's sickly ubiquity even in places and times that seem to promise freedom from it.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> The violence isn't the problem. It's the rest of the film that's not quite right.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> British director Michael Winterbottom adapts the classic pulp fiction of American novelist Jim Thompson here, but something gets lost in translation.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Winterbottom keeps Thompson's bleakness intact, leaving us little to engage with. But the film has an earth beauty and is a haunting look at the dark side of being human.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Thompson fans should rejoice at seeing a film that truly captures the dark heart of this great novelist's work.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Taking a cold, cruel plunge into its sociopath's world, Winterbottom's latest genre swerve is an accomplished neo-noir.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Beautifully shot, superbly written and genuinely chilling, this is a gripping noir thriller with a terrific central performance from Casey Affleck.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> This again-atypical film from Winterbottom is a much more sober affair than its early, controversial press might suggest.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> As darkly disturbing as Jim Thompson's novel, this is a genuinely upsetting film that might also be Winterbottom's best. Not for everyone, but near-faultless all the same.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Ultimately, the images stay with you for all the wrong reasons.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> David Lynch might have made something subversive out of these off-putting elements. Winterbottom has no idea what to do.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> A bit too silly for its own good ... Yet even if this is my least favorite Winterbottom since 9 Songs, I'd be lying if I said I don't appreciate the effort.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.9 <###> A virtual love letter to the best of "pulp fiction" storytelling and, as such, the film is most assuredly for grown-ups only.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Represents a rare misfire for the director.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Just a couple of unappetizing scenes in an otherwise painfully dull picture with no grasp on the tightening noose against Tom nor the development of the portrait of a seriously disturbed serial killer.
770871812 <###> The Killer Inside Me <###> Western;Drama;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.95 <###> Many with loathe it, but hopefully, just as many will love it.
771255989 <###> Last Screening <###> Horror <###> 0.375 <###> Is this what watching too many movies will do to you?
771255989 <###> Last Screening <###> Horror <###> 0.4 <###> A wasted opportunity; what could have been a deliciously dark-humoured look at the nature of celebrity and fantasy is a dreary stab at the horror genre.
10513 <###> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Much of the movie is exciting. But none of it is as satisfying as what Jackson was able to create in Fellowship, the first film.
10513 <###> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> While some people think this surpasses the original, I don't. The storylines are fractured and geographically and narratively it's sometimes hard to figure out what's going on... but the positives are many.
10513 <###> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> The Two Towers was always going to be the toughest book to adapt, yet Peter Jackson pulls it off. Part Two is easily as exciting, involving and visually inventive as Part One.
10513 <###> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> It's darker and more urgent than the opening segment, and Jackson again displays an unparalleled grasp of storytelling on a grand scale.
10513 <###> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a pitch-perfect second act, full of dark wonder and the slow, pounding pulse of Aragorn's unflagging hope.
10513 <###> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Marches along with considerably more assurance and smoothness than the desperately crammed Fellowship.
10513 <###> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> The movie doesn't deepen or expand the tale's themes as masterfully as The Empire Strikes Back added to Star Wars' mystique. But as a stirring story of unsullied heroism, it's a winner, and as an action epic, it features superb battle sequences.
10513 <###> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> The Two Towers, then, is the greatest blockbuster ever made without either a beginning or an end, a feisty beast with a hollow ring in its bones.
10513 <###> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Andy Serkis's work in creating Gollum deserved an honorary Academy Award. His gestures and voice, not computer software, make Gollum so memorable as he wrestles with his inner homicidal maniac. A soaring, searing tale of wonderment.
10513 <###> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> Gollum and the battles are a triumph of integrated art and technology, and the battles a masterstroke of sheer logistics. (Extended Edition)

10513 <###> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Less direct and coherent than its predecessor, but wider in scope, Jackson/Tolkein's difficult second movie just about manages to get away with it all, and there are times when it provides a rollicking good adventure.
10513 <###> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> The battle is one of the best of its kind in film history, a symphony of bloodlust and hopes dashed and restored.
10513 <###> The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> Yes, Peter Jackson demands nine hours of your time. But I can't think of a director more deserving.

21401 <###> The Gold Rush <###> Classics;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> It shows Chaplin mixing slapstick with heartbreak like nobody else could. It's plotted in an episodic fashion, but each piece of the puzzle is also a memorable, entertaining bit in and of itself.
21401 <###> The Gold Rush <###> Classics;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> "The Gold Rush" is wonderfully charming. The comedic bits are both memorable and humorous, the score is exquisite, and it looks pretty darn great for being as old as it is. It's timeless in the sense that it'll be enjoyable now and 100 years from now.

771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Turturro and Allen make for a good double act in some strong scenes, but the film as a whole feels light, without too much real substance.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Though not a Woody Allen picture, it's clear Fading Gigolo is heavily influenced by the work of its supporting actor.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> In today's economy, Gigolo opens a new service option, but the movie's concept works better when played for absurdity.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.86 <###> In synopsis, Fading Gigolo might sound a little trashy; in its execution, it's gentle and sweet.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Fading Gigolo peters out significantly in the buildup to its utterly underwhelming final stretch...
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Oy and hooray!
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> With a witty observational script, amusing characters and a jazzy sense of life in New York, this feels like an old-fashioned Woody Allen movie, even though Allen merely costars in it.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> If you can get beyond the implausibility of Sharon Stone paying John Turturro to join her in a menage a trois - and, frankly, I couldn't - then there are lightweight pleasures to be had amid the wry, angsty middle-aged male fantasy.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Taken as a whimsical but fiery romantic comedy, it has easily enough charm to get away with its own idiosyncrasies.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The film pokes gentle and sometimes not so gentle fun at religious ultra-orthodoxy, which won't please everyone, but does so with unfailing charm and wit.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The script rings false from the off.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The preposterousness of this plot marks Fading Gigolo as a vanity project, but it's hard to take Turturro too much to task when he hits so many other grace notes in between blowing his own horn.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It has some funny moments, mostly courtesy of a scene-stealing Allen, but it is more of a quirky character study than a conventional comedy.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It's relaxed, amusing and warm, but nothing rings true.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> The great John Turturro comes a-cropper in this tin-eared comedy of male sexual mores.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> A story that pretends to be about sex but is actually focused on revealing the true nature of intimacy.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Only in the scenes between Fioravante and Avigal does the film find a pace of its own, becoming a story about two private people tentatively seeking connection.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Allen, oddly, is delightful - every crumpled line-reading flawlessly timed. Otherwise, the rhythm is so off that if you tried to dance to it you would turn an ankle.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's one of Allen's best film roles in years; acting in someone else's movie, he looks liberated, with a spring in his step: at one point, he almost skips his way through a scene.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A little bit of fun, but the memory fades.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> It's tailor-made for Allen; not only is he as funny as he's been in years, he and Turturro make a wonderful double act, lacing a seedy-sounding script with warmth and humour.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The premise is slightly bizarre but there's enough wink-and-a-nod charm in the performances to earn it a pass.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Turturro's ensemble comedy/drama makes the unlikely, pluasible
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Turturro's major inspiration, and the thing that makes Fading Gigolo rather special, was teaming himself with Allen. They are a screen team made in heaven.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Like the character he plays, Turturro clearly wants his film to be adored, but Fading Gigolo's decidedly male fantasy doesn't offer enough laughs or heart to be more than a passing diversion.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> If it's hard out here for a pimp, as Juicy J, DJ Paul and Frayser Boy assured us, how much harder must it be when said pimp is Woody Allen? Surprisingly, not that hard, judging from 'Fading Gigolo.'
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> This initially promising picture finds itself fading well before the end.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Writer/director/star John Turturro's exploration of sex, intimacy, and loneliness has knockout performances, sly insight, and a tantalizing premise going for it.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It's like a Woody Allen movie--same music, same shtick--but without the uneasy moral takeaways.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> "But given that so few movies these days give any substantial screen time to talented, but supposedly "aging" character actors like (John) Turturro and Liev Schreiber, you can't help but appreciate it a little more."
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Seriously. No one would pay several thousand to sleep with a middle-aged guy who looks like John Turturro.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The male escort subplot turns on Fiorevante setting up a three-way with Sharon Stone and Sofia Vergara for $2,000. That's $2,000 that they're paying him!
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's not a film that will stick to your ribs to any great degree, but it is a quiet charmer, one that ends up being a pleasant enough diversion for grown-up audiences.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Fading Gigolo is a fading film memory in an instant, but, for Allen devotees, cosy and snug while you suck on it.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The chemistry is just right between Allen and Turturro, who immediately register as best friends for life, and between Stone and Turturro, whose mutual awkwardness gives way to a goofy form of passion.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There are bits and pieces of a dandy film here that get choked out by a barrier of unproductive mulch.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A more accurate title for this midlife crisis black comedy would substitute "fading" with "aging."
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> While Allen emerges from this mash-up relatively unscathed, Turturro as an implausible male prostitute gets maimed at the intersection of comedy and drama.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Fading Gigolo is perhaps his [John Turturro] most successful blend of offbeat humour and observational drama to date.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Each half of the plot is strange and funny in an entirely different way, but the two never mesh as a whole like they might in a novel, so the wildness of this storyline grab bag leaves the stitching far too visible.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> A slight movie but enjoyable nevertheless even if its brevity hints at something that, given more time to breathe, could have been a richer, more rewarding experience.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> There's no real depth to Fading Gigolo, but it is a likeable lark that has the smarts to stay on the right side of silly. Had it pushed its one-joke premise, watching it could have been a painful experience.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> This movie was doomed from draft one of the script.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Turturro has said that Allen pushed him to make the film more personal and deeper, although part of what I liked is that it starts off with lightness, pushed along by a fabulous jazz and Latin score.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It's difficult not to query his [Turturro] intentions, as the 57-year-old, best known for playing eccentric or sometimes comically loopy characters for the likes of the Coen brothers, has made such a slight and increasingly unsatisfying movie.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Fading Gigolo gets an extra star merely for showcasing the egg cream, the Brooklyn beverage that is the nectar of the gods. Shalom!
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It's all fairly slight.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> At times thuddingly earnest...at times, jazzily, goofily endearing...Turturro's romanticism keeps undercutting the humor before it has a chance to get satisfyingly irreverent. Call it comoedia interruptus.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> As a filmmaker, Turturro evokes a sense of this community that's surprisingly nuanced and rich.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> The tone swoops from touching drama to hambone commedia dell'arte without setting a foot wrong.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Here we have a genial, gentle rom-com with a difference from writer-director John Turturro.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> The delusional, sleazily written Fading Gigolo, a study of loneliness that should itself have been isolated from society, left me feeling shocked and dirty.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> This most unlikely premise has been handled with such aplomb by Turturro, who wrote as well as directed, that you are really charmed by the film and by everyone in it.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Apparently, only Woody Allen can make a Woody Allen movie. At least a good one.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Turturro is thoroughly sympathetic in his portrayal of everyone involved (which is not quite the same as approving), and he makes excellent use of a religious subculture that takes sex very seriously (which is not quite the same as disapproving).
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A slight, minor comedy that feels like something Woody Allen might have come up with on a lazy afternoon.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Aside from Allen, "Fading Gigolo" is a rather grim movie.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Blithely crude in execution if not spirit, this odd-shaped romantic comedy aims for sweet, but only gets there occasionally.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Way, way better than a movie with its premise has any right to be.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The film nevertheless offers some enjoyable scenes and plenty of humorous dialogue between Turturro's florist-turned-Casanova and co-star Woody Allen's bumbling hustler.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Had Fading Gigolo been nothing but its romance scenes, it still would not be entirely successful, because it's strangely muted. There is a quietude to the romance that subtlety plays up the emotional stakes, but keeps us from being fully invested.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Turturro's direction owes a little something to Spike Lee, and a lot to Woody Allen.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It's not really a home run, but as an aging urban dweller it hit some notes both antic and plangent for me. If you're a fan of any of the cast members it might well do the same for you.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Not without its charms, this modern day Don Juan tale and his complicated relations fails to live up to promise of what could have been.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Turturro has many dots that he never connects here.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> A slight, comical and intermittently affecting film about loneliness and desire.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> For all its shortcomings, "Gigolo" knows when to turn on the charm.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Woody can be annoying but never more so than here as his constant whining voice becomes as bad as fingernails across a blackboard muttering his way through while Turturro wanders around like he's in a daze.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Sex is treated with goofy solemnity [...] and credible human behavior repeatedly gets tossed aside so that people do whatever is necessary to keep the ludicrous plot in motion.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> I couldn't figure out what these two movies - one larkish but trivial, the other emotionally ambitious - have to do with one another. Neither, apparently, could Turturro.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> We'll take messy and interesting over neat and uninteresting any day - especially when a movie has as much heart as this.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> John Turturro is a gifted and charming actor, but he has a fatal desire to be a film director and is cursed with no talent whatsoever for the job.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> If you've missed the fumbling Allen of Broadway Danny Rose, out of his element and only the "beard," that guy is back.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A movie as entertaining as some of Woody Allen's classics but also one with its own personality.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Turturro's attempt at an old school Woody Allen comedy -- mostly without the laughs.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> What could have been a shallow, salacious romp ends up being a much more heartfelt endeavor about old friends, new love, and the need for human compassion.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> The question of why one should actually work up any emotional investment in what happens to these people is never really answered, much less asked in the first place.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> A charming, funny and oddball drama about a gentle, quiet, and sensitive florist who knows how to give women pleasure.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> One of the most shameless vanity projects I've ever seen.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Fading Gigolo is a charming little film that is entirely inoffensive despite its subject matter.
771271557 <###> Fading Gigolo <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Turturro has given Allen his biggest and best on-screen turn in years: the part was written for him and it's full of scope for aimble kvetching and nimble slapstick.
771246876 <###> The River Murders <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> ...a disappointingly uneven endeavor that can't quite get the job done...
771246874 <###> Assassination Games <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> As the star of Assassination Games, Jean-Claude Van Damme makes a lot of great decisions. As the executive producer, he appears to have made fewer.
771246874 <###> Assassination Games <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.125 <###> A direct-to-video-quality actioner distinguished primarily by its star's blatantly deteriorated martial-arts prowess.
577133715 <###> Hellboy: Sword of Storms <###> Action & Adventure;Television;Horror;Animation;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Dark, fun ghost story for older kids and adults.
577133715 <###> Hellboy: Sword of Storms <###> Action & Adventure;Television;Horror;Animation;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> The animation and landscapes are fantastic with whimsical tones reminiscent of "Vampire Hunter D"...
577133715 <###> Hellboy: Sword of Storms <###> Action & Adventure;Television;Horror;Animation;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Sword of Storms gets right what other cartoons aimed at older kids and their parents struggle to achieve.

770672469 <###> Before the Rains <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The movie has enough fine acting -- especially by Bose and by Jennifer Ehle as the planter's deceived wife -- and beautiful, razor-sharp cinematography (also by Sivan) to recommend it.

770672469 <###> Before the Rains <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Set among the first wave of nationalism that led to India's independence, this highly symbolic story is tautly constructed to create high-wire tension between the oh-so-white British colonialists and the traditional Indian ways.
770672469 <###> Before the Rains <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> A resolutely old fashioned story of personal tribulations played out against a backdrop of political turmoil, Sivan's film is well acted, beautifully photographed and oddly reassuring.
770672469 <###> Before the Rains <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Merchant-Ivory productions are usually visual delights, and Before the Rains is no exception. Pity that the direction and narrative lack passion. If there's anything a story of interracial adultery needs, it's passion.

625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Josef Goebbels had a home movie made of the failed 1944 Hitler assassins being hanged from meathooks with piano wire. It probably had more laughs, more fun, more feelgood moments than this family comedy.

625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> Somewhere, Rainn Wilson is smiling to himself.That's because, unlike some of the rest of John Krasinski's castmates from "The Office," he wasn't involved in "License to Wed," a wretched excuse for a romantic comedy.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> ...a grating, nigh unwatchable piece of work.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> If you have seen the trailers for this film, you have seen most of the funny moments and are not missing anything in this by-the-numbers rom/com.

625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Too dependent on Williams to fill in the humorless gaps here, and the humor itself just isn't funny in the first place.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> Looks like Robin Williams has replaced Cuba Gooding, Jr. as the kiss of death on the set of any comedy.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The movie's premise isn't a story. It's a stand-up comedy joke...
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> "License to Wed" is so awful that if I had to choose between sitting through it or "RV" again, I would actually have to sit and think about it for a while

625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Krasinski and Moore are an adorable couple, but marriage material they aren't, especially since they're given a mere ten minutes to form a full-fledged relationship before Williams breathlessly barges into the picture.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Like some weddings, License to Wed is a long sit and a bland buffet.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> This assaultively unappealing 'romantic comedy' could well mark the opening salvo in a whole new Hollywood campaign against movie piracy. Anybody who'd steal this dud would stink just from carrying it around.

625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Forget about Saw, Hostel and all the other films in the new, notorious torture-porn genre. If you're looking for a really sick movie, check out License to Wed.

625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> What this is really about is yet another entry in one of the more loathsome comedy genres, the humiliation of the hero.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The movie is plodding, predictable, formulaic and, worst of all, not funny.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The outtakes that accompany the end credits suggest that making the movie was a blast; it's a shame the same can't be said for watching it.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> It used to be annoying when Robin Williams insisted on wrecking comedies with his overbearing shtick. Now, it's just sad and pathetic.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> The story ends with a sentimental clunk. To say the picture isn't funny is putting it mildly. It isn't tolerable.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> All it does is make you wish [Robin Williams] never discovered movies -- or, at least, stuck to voicing cartoons and doing the odd, occasional drama.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> The movie is a pastiche of tortured slapstick, groan-inducing dialogue and a lethal dose of treacle, apparently awaiting one of Williams' trademark sprees of riffing and vamping to save the day. That moment never comes.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The worst idea for a studio comedy since last year's equally dreadful Failure to Launch.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Will Robin Williams ever divorce himself from the unholy union of silliness and sentimentality?

625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Just another mediocre addition -- worse than the best sitcoms, better than the worst -- to the expanding list of movies that make Netflix a far more appealing option than going to a theater.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Robin Williams plays a reverend running the Marquis de Sade School of Marriage Counseling in this desperately unfunny movie.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Krasinski affirms that he can carry more than a desk job on The Office, and Moore plays straight gal in a film that improves, at least, on her last role in the ugh-inducing Because I Said So. License to Wed doesn't fail her this time.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Anyone who has been through the process of church-mandated marriage preparation counseling should get a chuckle out of License to Wed, that is if the comedy weren't so badly handled.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> You'd never know from License to Wed that Krasinski is a big asset to The Office. Here, playing an unappealing male lead, he merely smugs his way through the assignment.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> For all the Hollywood obviousness of the reassuring ending, [director] Kwapis and his writers put over the subversive message that marriage can be maddening.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Anyone who wanders into License to Wed expecting a sweet-natured romantic comedy is likely to feel like the sensitive surface of that metaphorical tongue: ripped off.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> This is the sort of lobotomized, condescendingly lazy movie that leaves you resentful of Hollywood.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Reverend Frank offers rib-ticklers such as: 'On the honeymoon, pretend to be surprised.' In the theater, pretend to be entertained.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Do they have what it takes to keep it cool and stay together long enough to get hitched? Trust me, you won't care.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> No matter how hard I try, I'm finding it difficult to write anything positive about License to Wed. This movie is bad from top to bottom, front to back, and start to finish.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> Sometimes I wonder what really goes on in the offices of studio executives.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> [Krasinski and Moore] have bankable chemistry, and it allows License to float along for longer than you'd think possible.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Somewhere along the way, somebody should have pulled this License, at least until the writers found funnier stuff for everybody to do.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> License to Wed is another lamebrain Hollywood comedy in which a peanut gallery of the shrill and the narcissistic conspire to drive a wedge between two innocents.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> This crude and unfunny comedy represents one of the low points in what has already been a disappointing summer-movie season.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Weddings are supposed to be happy occasions, but this shrill by-the-numbers comedy provides little reason to smile.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> License to Wed is set on a plane of existence not inhabited by intelligent life, but by widespread nincompoops.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Like a creepy kid who has taken a few too many Ritalin tablets, License to Wed bounds around the screen wildly, overanxious to prove its wackiness.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Mandy Moore is so likable, while Robin Williams is so not. [But] John Krasinski is like wallpaper. He's just there.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Williams has become a comedic glass ceiling, a black hole of laughs that guarantees every scene he's in will make nails on a chalkboard sound appealing.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> The only amusing thing about License to Wed is the idea that it's supposed to be funny in the first place.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> A droll, amusing cautionary tale about the chances of living "happily ever after" - and wait for the zany outtakes during the final credits.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Another by-the-books exercise in formula romantic comedies ... no surprises and no real reason to have to subject yourself to this.
625475402 <###> License to Wed <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> As with 50% of all marriages in this country, this film breaks down irretrievably, leaving all concerned feeling hurt, angry, and not a little betrayed.

770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Less an evolution of the most famous fashionista of the last century, and more an exploration of how an influential figure found love while finding her calling.

770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> An interesting, but slow, look at the life of the legendary Chanel before she became famous.

770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> A movie that is tres chic even if it sometimes resembles those corsets Coco banished, a little stiff and confining.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> I don't remember ever seeing a photo of Chanel before, but when we see Tautou as the middle-aged, iconic Chanel, a cigarette dangling insouciantly from her lips, I knew it was an uncanny resemblance.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Ultimately, [Benoit Poelvoorde] is the one who holds this knotty yarn in place.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> This guilty pleasure costume drama leaves you wanting to know more about this extraordinary woman considered one of the most influential in the 20th century. Let's hope that Fontaine can do a follow-up with "After" in the title.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The script...adheres closely to biopic conventions but is brought alive by the magnetic performance of Tautou with strong support particularly from Poelvoorde and Devos.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> 'Coco Before Chanel'? Whose bright idea was that? Isn't that like 'Amelia Before Airplanes'? Or 'Frankenstein Before Med School'?
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A better title: "Coco Before She Was Interesting."
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Earlier in the year we had Julia Childs, two weeks ago we has Amelia Earhart, and this week we have Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel. Who's next? Rachel Ray and her journey to invent edible crayons? Hannah Montana's battle against Dissociative Identity Disorder?
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A familiar lemonade-from-lemons period biopic or, in the case of the fashionista, a smart-suit-from-tattered-threads tale.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> There's a lot to like here. The film looks beautiful, and Alexandre Desplat's score is suitably moody.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The thread connecting the ambitious girl to the acclaimed woman is enough to make us wish for a sequel titled Chanel No. 2.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Fontaine manages to create a film that captures both the essence of its subject and the times and circumstances that helped to shape her.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> A bit more of Coco becoming Chanel was what I expected, and what would have elevated this film beyond the typical period-piece love story fare.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> In Coco Before Chanel, Audrey Tautou coolly charms as the designer in her formative years. On a scale of 8, the film is a Chanel #5.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Like the recently opened Amelia, the story could well be an accurate depiction of Chanel's life but it, too, is not all that engaging.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> We are used to seeing Tautou play the sweetheart. Here, she's anything but. Constantly smoking, dour, unsmiling, critical, she plays a character difficult to warm to but fascinating to watch.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Audrey Tatou may have been born to play Coco Chanel ...
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> It's nice when so many technical and emotional elements come together in a film. Coco Before Chanel is a hard luck, true life fairy tale story told with poignant humility, embellished with solid acting and determined direction.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Although technically a biopic based on a nonfiction book by Edmonde Charles-Roux, Coco Before Chanel plays more like an engrossing, classy period piece.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Tautou's sophisticated portrayal won't allow viewers to dismiss Coco as kept. Coco's talents are too pronounced, her approach to intimacy, to life, too aware for that.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It's a perfectly nice period piece and biographical backgrounder, but the film feels as though it's a meal of tasty side dishes that lacks a main course.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The film, although sumptuously produced, is a staid and conventional account of her early years.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> The film, understandably, leaves you wanting more about the rest of the designer's life, but Coco Before Chanel is wisely focused on those years in which she became herself.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A droll and humorless story, it is a lifeless rendition of the early life of Coco Chanel before she became famous.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> The movie does a good job of presenting the social strictures that Chanel refused to be bound by, none more immediate and ubiquitous than the clothes women were expected to wear.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> It would seem that Fontaine has a keener eye for the elements that made Chanel's style than she has an ear for dialogue. But she gets a splendid performance from Tautou.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> The film loses some of its fascination when Coco is unmistakably launched on her career path. But that's when the story ends; this is titled Coco Before Chanel for a reason.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> One can see where the story might be of great interest to fans and devotees of Chanel, but for casual viewers who have never seen her as more than the face behind an empire, there's too little in this movie to provide more than a casual diversion.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Tatou unerringly captures the feistiness and lack of regard for the truth that Coco used to become such an enormous success.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The movie is trite but pretty, with great sets and period costumes, and as it's anchored on Chanel's lovers and their role in her story, it can only be described as a chick flick.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Director Anne Fontaine is at her strongest when she's aiding and abetting Chanel's all-seeing gaze.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> A more conventional movie would work this love triangle to maximum pathos. Fontaine sees it as simply part of the Chanel construct, and Tautou is completely in tune with her.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Coco Chanel is not the most lovable of heroines, but it's a strength of the film that director Anne Fontaine allows Tautou to make Coco as cold and ungiving as she does.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> You know they're out of ideas when all Tautou does is walk and look around, then walk and look around some more. It's as if she's window-shopping for another movie. The one she's in isn't terrible. But it's not interesting, either.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> By the end, the film has slipped into TV-ready hagiography while nonetheless inducing the urge for a crisp white collar and French cuffs.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Visually attractive and moderately diverting.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Tautou not only resembles Chanel, she inhabits the role completely, using flashing eyes and a relentless intelligence to convey the unbending strength of a woman determined to make something of her life in a time and place when that was far from the norm.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> A flat, airless tale of a sullen hooker who lucked out.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> In the end, even the style and structure of the film are tributes to the great designer herself -- clean, classic and unadorned. And completely unapologetic.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> The blossoming of her ambition, as much as her love life, drives the story forward, and turns Coco Before Chanel into a costume drama worthy of the name.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The only biopic approved by the House of Chanel, clearly for its utter topicality and lack of challenge to Chanel's mythos. Amazing how a life so thoroughly lived could come off so flat and listless onscreen.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> The film, while scaled-down, is quite beautifully woven, like a classic Chanel tweed.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> a solidly-made glimpse into an icon whose presence is still felt today
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> A bittersweet glimpse of the early life of the legendary French fashion icon Coco Chanel.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Fontaine dramatizes Coco's struggles respectfully if mundanely, crafting believable period detail for her procession of key-life-moment scenes, all of which employ serviceable but far from groundbreaking psychologizing.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Anne Fontaine's first historical outing is both a compelling drama and a lavish period piece.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> It's a work of hagiography that serves neither history nor its subject well.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> We expect a fashion flick to be bitchy, shiny, brittle and superficial. So Coco Before Chanel may give many fashionistas the needle.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> More a snapshot of a moment than conventional biography, and while less complex than it might want to be, still a quietly thoughtful look at one of the 20th century's most influential characters.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Fontaine's film is gorgeous, but its beauty is practical, almost textile, like a Chanel tweed.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Definitely not just for the fashion slaves; this is an inspiring portrait of a woman who cut her own cloth to fit.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Rather staid in its approach, this film is nowhere near as fascinating and unpredictable as its subject.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> A handsomely dressed and tastefully furnished drama that rolls out pretty conservatively, but is notable for two excellent performances.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Tautou is just terrific, and to recall an actress who could so dominate your memory of a movie, one needs to think back to Audrey Hepburn.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> An epic story that gradually develops into a beautiful and beguiling homage to the first lady of fashion.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Fontaine never really hits the ground running with her subject matter, leaving Coco Before Chanel feeling like an elaborate warm-up for a more intriguing film.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Pretty then, but as decoratively superficial as those society hats Chanel loathed.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Playing Coco's orphaned beginnings like a violin, writer/director Anne Fontaine shows a sure hand when it comes to emotional button-pushing.
770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> It's too bad that so photogenic a star is saddled with such a stodgy biopic, which crams about half an hour's worth of incident into 110 minutes.

770805147 <###> Coco Before Chanel <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Those flocking in for the fancy frocks will be in for a surprise in this approved biopic, which has its emphasis on the "before" part of the title.

112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> full review in Greek
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Wim Wenders y Sam Shepard (Paris, Texas) recuperan (en excelente fotografia y mejor musica) una iconografia norteamericana al servicio de una historia sobre el desarraigo y la necesidad de recuperar vinculos largamente perdidos.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The widescreen visual poetry of "Don't Come Knocking" seems less like inspiration and more like overcompensation.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Emotionally arid and narratively lazy, the film is so tentative it seems to be evaporating before our very eyes.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The story is as meandering as it is self-indulgent.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Potential filmgoers should read the title carefully. Then take the message heart.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Aspires to be a story of redemption and discovery, but it's too undercooked to be either.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The charm here is in watching Shepard and Lange, and Shepard and Saint play off one another, and the leisurely pace of the 'discoveries' that aren't really secrets in the first place.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.78 <###> ... the story ... isn't big enough to stand up to the characters who blow through it or to resist being overwhelmed by the geography on which it's set.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A sparse, rolling drama with some strong laughs that prods at a western movie star's surprising past.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Superb supporting performances from Polley and Baulk go some way to making up for our hero's lesser qualities.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Don't Come Knocking might have been better in the hands of a less self-conscious director, but it's nonetheless a captivating drama.

112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> With its wonderful veteran cast, its heart on its sleeve, and a love for the landscape that suffuses its technique, Don't Come Knocking is a peculiar but rewarding escape.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The narrative that unfolds in the wake of Spence's journey recalls Paris but walks too heavy for a character study to gel.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The dusty backdrop evokes a palpable sense of transience and the lingering past, but there's ultimately very little beneath the gesturing.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Sam Shepard, an actor of increasingly bimbo-ish narcissism, gives another tiresome, cowboy-hat-wearing performance in a monumentally boring and conceited film.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The pacing is so poky, and the situations so loopy, that the movie skirts the line between unintentionally comic and knowingly pretentious.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> At times the film is labored and forced.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> That the movie doesn't deepen so much as trail off is a frustrating but fitting embodiment of a protagonist who's never taken responsibility for anything.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> An engaging drama with strong performances and gorgeous photography, this a minor return to form for director Wim Wenders.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Spence has much in common with Shepard and Wenders. They seem equally bewildered about what to do, other than spending nearly two hours demonstrating that Spence is a self-pitying fool.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> [Wenders and Shepard] ramble the stark countryside, two filmmakers in search of meaning. Interesting, beautiful to watch, but pointless.

112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Squanders an interesting set-up and lead character for half-baked indie quirkiness, unstimulating Americana and dull themes about family...
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> As soon as the paint dries, you might as well hang Wenders' non-moving picture in a museum.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The story is faintly ridiculous, but the cinematography and composition are beautiful and even stunning.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> It's a tale prevalent in movies today ... men who have run from family and responsibility begin to yearn for what they've left behind.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> As arresting as the images are, Shepard's clunky, soap-opera banter brings most everything, and everyone, crashing down to earth.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Shards of honesty pierce the action, true little moments that wound or heal a weak man in a flawed story.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> A moving film that hangs with you like a favorite vacation to red-rock country.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Don't Come Knocking finally doesn't work for me, because instead of embodying its themes it seems to be regarding them from outside, with awe, as if it is the high school production of itself.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Often occupying more than half the screen, the sky is like a character in the movie, but, unfortunately, it's the most interesting character in the film, which has a bright, distinct look and dull, forgettable people.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> There's something a little absurd about this story, but for me, it's endearingly goofy.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> When Wenders spins his camera around Shepard in a 24-hour pan Don't Come Knocking finds an invisible framework and plucks it like a guitar string.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The movie ambles along like an old Western cowpoke, but it does eventually get where it's going; the ride may be a little bumpy, but it's a pleasant journey to take.

112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Beautifully shot in rich colors by Franz Lustig, it's possibly Wenders' most accessible film to date, and among his most emotionally satisfying.
112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Showcases some fantastic photography, terrific acting, and a superb soundtrack, but it's not the masterpiece that Paris, Texas is.

112770461 <###> Don't Come Knocking <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> This lonesome cowpoke story has its moments of visual beauty, but fails to capture the magic of the first Wenders-Shepard collaboration, 1984's intimate Western Paris, Texas.

13864 <###> Romeo Is Bleeding <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The cast tries to make up for the script's hollowness by hurling themselves headlong into the sort of bloody, sweating, spittle-spewing performances that can sometimes turn thin material into personal triumphs, but to little avail.

13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Now where did we put our gold watch?
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> This movie gets its charge not from action pyrotechnics but from its electric barrage of language, wisecracks and dialogue, from the mordant '70s classicism of its long-take camera style and its smart, offbeat, strangely sexy cast.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Whether you call it razzmatazz, pizazz or sizzle, Pulp Fiction's got it, enough style for a dozen movies and, truth be told, enough story for five.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Pulp Fiction isn't the sleazy work of a shock artist giving us things no one else will put on film. This is the work of someone talented, smart and thrilled to be making movies, giving us things no one else can put on film.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> At 153 minutes, the movie does occasionally flirt with tedium, but the risk is worth it: The whole is finally greater than the sum of its pulpy parts. What could have been an anything-goes pastiche has surprising rigor and narrative clarity.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a Saturday Night Fever dream: a hot, dense, wicked disco of tough-guy posturings, vivid dips of violence and literally unbelievable plot moves.

13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> If you smile at David Mamet's dialogue, you'll laugh out loud at the words of Quentin Tarantino.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Its dedicated fan-base and the pop-culture reverberations that have flowed steadily from it, almost 20 years on, echo Tarantino's achievements with Pulp Fiction. Unassailable filmmaking.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> When the dust settles, just as the Coens will ultimately be seen as the canniest literary critics of their generation, Tarantino will be seen as the most perceptive, most instinctive film critic of his.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> A balls-out postmodern comedy par excellence. It's a Royale with Cheese. [Blu-ray]

13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> A modern classic, more memorable than the 1970s flicks that inspired it.

13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> But what makes the film such wicked fun is the way Tarantino delivers the familiar with a twist. He continually prepares us for one thing and then delivers another.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> In most cases, the three-act, A-to-B-to-C film formula works just fine. But the letter Q makes the other letters obsolete.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> A devilishly lurid blast of great entertainment. Ultra-violent and wickedly funny.

13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Without its commitment to an idea of salvation, Pulp Fiction would be little more than a terrific parlor trick; with it, it's something far richer and more haunting.

13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> ...postmodernism in a frenzy, a kind of chaotic quantum physics of film.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Quentin Tarantino's second feature, Pulp Fiction, is at once immensely entertaining and remarkably weightless.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> A truly extraordinary film.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Scintillating.

13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> One of the most audacious, confounding, and ultimately exciting pieces of cinema to hit the screen in years.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> This is a work of such giddy vitality and unrepentant excess that you'll not only overlook its flaws; you'll be compelled to embrace them.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> All the details are executed to perfection. Ironies abound in the smallest situations.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> The experience overall is like laughing down a gun barrel, a little bit tiring, a lot sick and maybe far too perverse for less jaded moviegoers.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Brilliant and brutal, funny and exhilarating, jaw-droppingly cruel and disarmingly sweet.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Pulp Fiction is violent, profane and filled with addicts, racists and killers. At the same time, it may be one of the most moral stories the big screen has seen in years.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> The movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careers.
13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Brilliantly written and unfathomably cool, this would make a good case for most quotable crime movie of all time.

13863 <###> Pulp Fiction <###> Drama <###> 1.1 <###> Rarely have I left a movie theatre more thrilled or invigorated as I did after leaving Pulp Fiction.
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> A movie that has a little bit of everything, and it's easily the best version of itself that could possibly be put together.
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> A goofy piece of over-the-top mayhem with half a brain.
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> A terrifically entertaining movie, and a sharp, funny social commentary from start to finish.
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Roger Corman is the master of doing a lot with a little, and Death Race 2000 is but one shining example of the filmmaker's know-how.
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Death Race 2000 is as Corman as his B-grade action pics come, with cars flying through the frame, blood spilling behind them, and overnight pit-stops for some sex ("navigators" in each car keep their drivers juiced up).
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> One of King Corman's finest pictures.
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> It has a comic strip premise which is neverthless wholly credible in a sick sort of way.
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Fun, fun, fun!
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Superior drive-in exploitation fare, this violent, campy action flick presents Carradine as Frankenstein, a scarred road warrior in black leather suit and cape.
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> a must see for so many people - science fiction fans, satirists, action movie buffs, 70s film aficionados and anyone who likes an over-the-top film
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> ...a mindlessly entertaining, thoroughly campy piece of work...
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Corman didn't direct the drive-in hit Death Race 2000, but it bears his imprint of economic utilitarianism.
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> In the end, it reveals itself to have nothing to say beyond the superficial about government or rebellion. And in the absence of such a statement, it becomes what it seems to have mocked -- a spectacle glorifying the car is an instrument of violence.
13861 <###> Death Race 2000 <###> Action & Adventure;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> An absolute must-see for true film fans.

771399485 <###> The Invisible Front <###> Documentary <###> 0.75 <###> Once it gets going, The Invisible Front slaps us in the face with just how savagely the Soviets treated Lithuanians they believed to be part of the resistance
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Can a movie be rife with profanity, nudity, vulgarity and sexual content, yet ultimately be as corny and wholesome as an Ozzie and Harriet episode? Unfortunately, yes.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The film's misfiring plot - it turns into a family farce by the finale - never quite makes enough sense to forgive it.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Sweaty, naked panic is a poor substitute for genuinely raw humour, so the movie comes across like The Benny Hill Show, Uncut.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> I counted three laughs in this wannabe bawdy comedy of errors, and one of them was a Breaking Bad gag so far past its tell-by date that even I got the joke.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Sex Tape is wittier and less smutty than its reputation might suggest.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Oh my, this is truly embarrassing.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Dreary and charmless.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Sex Tape is too busy blowing smoke up Apple's rear port to make any meaningful comment on the testy relationship between intimacy and technology.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> This gormless farrago feels like the manifestation of a vast collective nervous breakdown.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Does it matter that the film itself ain't that funny? Annie and Jay are mostly anodyne; Diaz and Segel really don't click.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It all feels terribly feeble and no matter how energetic and broad the comedy mugging of Diaz and an ill-looking Segel it rarely raises a laugh. What a right old Carry On.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The best news here is the elasticity of the star pairing.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Like cinematic contraception, this mirthless nonsense may put you off movies AND sex.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Limp.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Although it presents itself as a rude sex comedy, this movie is actually a prudish exercise in simplistic moralising.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Not especially funny or sexy.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Neither raunchy nor insightful enough, this Sex Tape underwhelms.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Segel and Diaz are fine, cute and up for it, but they are let down by a cynical script more interested in selling hardware than entertaining the audience.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Sex Tape is brisk but annoyingly light on laughs, a slight fumbling of an idea that deserved a more rigorous exploration.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Diaz and Segel manage to coax a few laughs out of a thin premise but there's nothing they can do with director Jake Kasdan's lame and surprisingly tame slapstick.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> An extremely mild improvement over Jake Kasdan's previous effort...
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> A farce that doesn't use, say, The Lady Eve, The 40-Year-Old Virgin or even Carry On Camping as its benchmarks, instead only hoping to out-funny the pictures of Andrei Tarkovsky, that video Werner Herzog won't let us see, and the concept of famine.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> succeeds only as an advertisement for the tablet mentioned every dozen words or so, and that forms the McGuffin chased with sadly ineffectual diligence by Segal and Diaz.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A tired premise and a sheen of desperate flop sweat tanks this DOA comedy, which plays more like an ancient Playboy doodle than a full-fledged movie.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Even for a farce, the situations stretch credulity far beyond the breaking point.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.1 <###> Dull, Bad, and Worse
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> It is a bland, clawless comedy; a cautionary tale of a high concept gone horribly, horribly wrong.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> It is, more, an embarrassment to the genre of R-rated comedy.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> 'Sex Tape' should be erased.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Segal and Diaz deserve combat pay for some of the naked stuff they go through. (No, you're not going to see full frontal, or pubal or boobal. Plenty of backal however.)
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Given the premise, the movie doesn't push the envelope as much as it could and perhaps should, but blame the MPAA and the studio system more than the scripters.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Trying to combine flaccid, family-friendly fun with a shallow sexcapade results in a total turn-off.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Not a great movie but still one of the funnier iPad commercials I've seen lately.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A jumbled mix of on-the-nose comedy set pieces and contrived emotional threads that squander any potential within Sex Tape's entertaining premise.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The laughs are intermittent, not consistent, and the central idea is trivialized, not investigated for its full comedy potential.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Mature, raunchy but hilarious comedy filled with profanity.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The only sustained funny sequence involves a straight-laced Lowe relaxing at home by casually sipping Scotch and listening to Slayer before doing lines of coke.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> As with most leaked sex videos, Sex Tape is more embarrassing to those involved than memorable to those who watch it. And the quicker it'&#8205;s forgotten, the better for everyone.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> It seems like this premise could get into some creative and maybe even subversive territory, but it mostly sticks to the basics.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> ...unfunny, vulgar, peurile...a story that had great possibilities done in by poor writing emphasizing F-bombs, inept directing, and maladroit acting.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Your itty bitty blip on the XTube radar means about as much to the rest of the population as if you got up at karaoke on a Thursday night in your mid-size city's third most popular venue and sang all the lyrics to "The Humpty Dance" from memory.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It's fitfully funny and exuberantly eager to please. The chief problem with Sex Tape, however, is that it remains a comedy of blushes as opposed to full-blown embarrassment.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Making a sex tape would be a lot more fun. Maybe someone also forgot to erase this movie?
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The folks behind Sex Tape did their homework. They just forgot the laughs.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> More sweet than salacious yet still very funny.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> Diaz and Segel stumble through the film as if no one wrote a script and they are the worst improvisational comics on the planet.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Sex Tape is perfectly watchable, funny slapstick contemporary comedy that, like Chef, does a very good job weaving the perils of social media into its plot.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Chemistry is everything ... in those terms, Sex Tape is nothing.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Yes, there are some laughs, but they're not as big or as frequent as one might expect from a would-be "major" comedy.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Its not unlike the porn videos that inspired it: with bad acting and a flimsy script it may temporarily satisfy but will soon be quickly forgotten.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Perhaps the best thing about Sex Tape is that it never gets icky or squicky or squeamish; it talks about sex as if it were something two consenting adults might enjoy as part of their relationship, not just a source of humiliation and 'comedy.'
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> An uneasy comedy that is not without its laugh-out-loud moments.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> For the most part, Sex Tape aspires to surf the same big, broad waves of blue laughter as a Bridesmaids or a Knocked Up, but never catches a ride for too long.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There are some funny moments, but the former "Bad Teacher" co-stars are surprisingly chemistry-free.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Just a naughty little escapade, enjoyable at the time but perhaps worth feeling guilty about immediately afterwards.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It made me laugh enough for it to merit a tepid endorsement.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Just lie back and think of funnier films.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Wouldn't it be funny if a middle-age couple had to track down their sex tape? Sure, that's not a terrible concept, but everything that follows doesn't seem even slightly well considered.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The very blatant set-up makes the gags feel a bit like vaudeville punchlines, coming from miles away and that much duller for their inevitability.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> It's the dynamic between Diaz and Segel that sells the movie.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> There are flashes of potential here ... but Sex Tape possesses too much comedic insecurity to do anything of value with them.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The real sex tape that [the characters] Jay and Annie are chasing all over town might have at least had some instructive value. The movie Sex Tape that Jason and Cameron have made can't even make that claim.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> If the first half of the movie is fairly sharp as these things go, the second half is increasingly, noisily ridiculous, with Diaz working extra hard for her laughs and verging on the shrill.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> There's not much to this pratfalling exercise in futility that we haven't seen before except for a flash of Cameron Diaz's bare rump. And that is hardly an experience worth 100 minutes of your one and only life.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> a haphazard, humiliating experience
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Given its subject matter and R rating, "Sex Tape" isn't as wild or woolly as it could be.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> [A] stilted, nearly humorless, non-titillating slog ...
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Sometimes, movies enchant and enlighten us about the human condition, and some nights, you go to "Sex Tape" and hope the popcorn isn't stale.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> The overall problem is that for an supposedly outrageous farce Sex Tape plays things extremely safe.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The cinematic equivalent of herpes.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> If "Sex Tape" ends up making money, it'll be strictly on the backs of its valiant performers, who surely sensed the weakness of the script and decided to go at it like a job, like turning an acting trick, finesse and pacing be damned.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The whole problem with "Sex Tape" in a sentence: After its first third, the two lead characters just run around trying to prevent something that the audience very much wants to see happen.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> For a movie filled with amateur porn, sex toys, cocaine and Cameron Diaz's butt, "Sex Tape" is awfully tame.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> By the time a blackmailing plot is introduced, the film seems to be surviving solely on the fumes of curse words and frequent shots of Jason Segal and Cameron Diaz's backsides.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> If there is anything good that comes from Sex Tape, it is the age-old lesson that you shouldn't make one, ever. Ever. No, really, ever.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A case study in how little interest American movies-and especially American sex comedies-have in dealing with sex as anything other than a source of cheap giggles and nonstop humiliation.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> I can't remember a big studio comedy in which the jokes were so bad, the timing so off, the chemistry so sour, and the whole project so reliant on bottom-feeding, old-as-the-hills gags.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A sometimes amusing R-rated comedy that never quite hits the spot.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Actually not terrible.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There are a handful of solid laughs sprinkled throughout, but the assumption is that bigger and better jokes are yet to come. They never do.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> It's a one-joke movie that feels like a one-joke movie.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Kind of sucks. And not in a good way.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> How could a movie that offers Jason Segel riffing on sex and Cameron Diaz regularly disrobing be so dull?
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> As far as date night movies go, you could do far worse than the raunchy yet sweet Sex Tape, featuring solid comedic turns from Cameron Diaz, Jason Segel, and Rob Lowe.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Jake Kasdan is to directing comedy what Friedrich Nietzsche is to baking apple strudel. Not much.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> There's a sadness to comedies like 'Date Night' and the new 'Sex Tape' - not just about how pathetically lazy they are, but in their subject matter as well.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> "Sex Tape" doesn't seduce, it doesn't surprise and it certainly doesn't satisfy. It only leaves you feeling a little taken advantaged of, as you take your walk of shame back to your car - and hoping you never hear from it again.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Even the most fervent fans of Cameron Diaz or Jason Segel will find little to like in Sex Tape, a tone deaf comedy about private life and public humiliation.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> An R-rated comedy that thinks it's provocative, yet is handcuffed by the inhibitions of its rom-com genre
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Comes across as small, uneven, and, at times, lazy.
771355227 <###> Sex Tape <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A fantastic but far-too-short appearance by Rob Lowe and some well-timed quips by Rob Corddry are not enough for this high concept comedy to deliver on the promised laughs.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> Toothless, poorly scripted and drowning in an overload of pointless CGI, Dracula Untold just plain sucks, both as a medieval epic and as the supposed launching pad for a new generation of movie monsters.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> ...another misguided contemporary update of a classic character.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> This reboot is a bloodless shell of the original Bram Stoker tale.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> For those Dracula fans who've yearned for a bad-ass vampire laying waste to his enemies rather than talk them to death, this one's for you.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> Basically, this "Dracula" needs to be buried in a cinematic coffin overladen with garlic and crucifixes.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> There was a good reason why this story of Dracula was untold. It should have remained that way.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> An orgy of CGI bat and battle stuff -- all of which is remarkably bloodless to hold tight to that PG-13 rating. It's all pretty tepid and mostly cartoonish.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Evans lacks the lasting charismatic presence for this kind of role, but works hard to ground every silly moment he's given with turbulent gravity.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.36 <###> Universal is hoping this will be the dawn of a new age for their classic monster franchises...but after seeing "Dracula Untold", my guess is Frankenstein and the Mummy won't be returning calls anytime soon.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Is it damning with faint praise to say that this horror fantasy doesn't totally suck?
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> Dracula Untold: a story that's been told many times before, and far far better.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> By throwing out the traditional vampire conflict, Dracula Untold loses its intrinsic (and prurient) appeal without gaining anything valuable in the process.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Luke Evans gives his Vlad the Impaler a brooding intensity, but this garbled origins idea is better left undead.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Dracula Untold is so patently ridiculous that it's hard to even fathom how it came to be.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Toothless.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> "Dracula Untold" is an artificial glorification lacking reason for the retelling. Even Dracula's wife outshines him in her supporting role.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> The fleeting moments of wit, subtlety, inventiveness and visual flair only clear the low bar of making this slightly more tolerable than "I, Frankenstein" -which similarly defiled a classic character in the futile hope for a fertile franchise.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> It's the Marvel-ization of Dracula in a PG-13, multiplex-ready package, but in exploring the myth of Vlad the Impaler the film offers plenty to sink your fangs into.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Batman begins.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Even if Dracula Untold isn't the greatest version of the Dracula legend, I welcome it as a reboot of this shared universe from the 1940s.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> The filmmakers and writers have messed with the bloodsucking legend, supplying stunning visuals but not much bite.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Dracula Untold is not a masterful or deep re-introduction to the franchise; but as genre fare, it's relatively fun in its depiction of the monster in a different light.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Dracula Untold-and even the title makes no sense-seems to be saying, "This is just the prologue; the next film is going to be great." Maybe it will be.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> This Vlad is not just an impaler but a hugger, at least when his young son is around. He is 'endearing,' according to his beautiful wife, citing a quality rarely if ever attributed to Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Never finds the right tone-be it frightful, funny, funky, horrifying, shocking or sexy-that viewers would expect from a modern flick about the most neck-fetish-ed, nocturnal daddy-o of them all.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Forget everything you read in those lying history books. Turns out Vlad the Impaler was a nice guy after all.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> It may be the dullest Dracula movie yet made.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> If you can selectively ignore this litany of inanity, you may find some substantial earthy pleasures in "Dracula Untold."
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> The idea is to humanize one of the most fearful monsters in the Western crypt. But Dracula Untold goes way overboard, past domestication and into canonization.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.45 <###> This is a callous cash-in on popular trends that just happens to have Dracula in it, a studio note that made it all the way to the big screen before anyone figured out how to do it right.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> [W]hat we get is an overly familiar Dracula movie that lacks a distinguishing personality.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> A generic vampire tale in the Underworld vein that comes closer to the infamous Van Helsing than a memorable re-interpretation of a legendary monster.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> I don't want what Dracula Untold is selling.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Whatever possessed the makers of Dracula Untold to think we'd be interested in a tragically unhip romance that backstories the infamous bloodsucker?
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> At times Dracula Untold flirts with dullness so much that it might as well just stick a stake in the heart of Bram Stoker's legacy.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> excruciatingly dull, really nothing more than a setup followed by a series of CG battle scenes
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> "Dracula Untold" tries to be the "Lord of the Rings" of horror movies. Surprisingly, it mostly succeeds.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Dracula Untold is exactly the monster you'd expect, trading horror for medieval action in the most acceptably mainstream way, which is not always a bad thing.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> This Vlad the Impaler has all the edge of Vlasic the pickle.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Honestly, there are plot holes in this movie you could drive a stake through.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Its best facet (or worst, depending on perspective) is its departure from the iconic vampire flicks of the past. "Dracula Untold" has about as much to do with Bela Lugosi's "Dracula" as "The Wolf of Wall Street" does with "The Wolf Man."
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> A generic medieval action epic on a tight budget, filled with garish CGI clutter and ironically bloodless violence.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> A bit where a Turkish emissary actually does a Columbo - complete with a finger point as he says, 'Just one more thing' - seems to have been included by accident.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> "Dracula Untold" feels longer than its 95-minute running time.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The weapons, Turkish helmets and Romanian interiors are all gorgeous. If only the rest of this "Lord of the Rings" wanna-be were at the same level.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> This is yet another unnecessary updating of Dracula (this time for the millennial generation) shot through with some rather impressive CGI battle sequences and little else.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> There's a good reason this part of the Dracula lore remained untold, and it should've stayed that way.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> The film's problems aren't limited to liberal cadging from comic books. In fact, that's precisely what's best about the film, which occasionally boasts gorgeous visuals. But the movie doesn't know when to stop stealing.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Schlocky, low-rent fun.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Here we have a vampire movie that brings together elements from other more popular movies.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> It falls into that far-too-large category of studio offerings that aren't good enough to be noteworthy or terrible enough to be truly entertaining.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> If this Dracula can kill hundreds of enemies by himself - and he can, and does, in several dull and protracted battle scenes - then where's the suspense? If he's become a monster for noble reasons, then where's the dark conflict?
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Don't go looking for horror, gore, or vampiric sexytimes; this here is an old-fashioned tragedy that just happens to involve a guy who can turn into a cloud of bats.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> It's a story arc that wouldn't be out of place on Game of Thrones, except it lacks for the HBO program's dense and surprising dramatic reflexes.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> But if you're looking for just a quick, fun, and forgettable vampire bite, then Dracula Untold doesn't disappoint.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Not as bad as you might think.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> This story, which paints Dracula as a romantic hero, may not have been told before, but there's a reason for that: it doesn't really make any sense.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> It may work for Game of Thrones addicts as a sort of cinematic methadone until the proper heroin returns next year. Can we even call that faint praise?
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Dracula Untold should have remained so.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Oh for the days when a vampire had fetid breath, feasted on virgins and could turn into a bat to terrorise villagers from his castle.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> This is a rousing Gothic bloodcurdler with all the trimmings: impalings, sword fights, swarms of bats, punctured necks, remote Transylvanian landscapes, non-stop spectacle and occasionally very ropy CGI.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Evans handles the dramatic scenes as well as he does the action later on, but ultimately this is a story nobody asked to be told.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> While we're waiting for the next batch of monster make-overs - we're surely only one step away from Leatherface in Love - there's quite a bit to enjoy here.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Dracula Untold is utter hokum, of course, but debut director Gary Shore nurses it along with a certain style and even occasional flashes of wit.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Mildly entertaining without offering any great quality, the movie is a half-decent action showcase for the talented Evans, the fight scenes are OK, and there is enough cheese and ham to fill a tasty sandwich.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> The market has been saturated with vampires in recent years, but fortunately Dracula Untold - an origins story that will hopefully lead to future outings - doesn't feel stale.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> This cursory reboot adopts the mirth-free mythology tactic beloved of modern superhero ventures.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> This half-hearted effort to launch a new action-horror franchise... suggests someone must have looked at every previous version of the material and thought: "You know what? Dracula needs to be more likeable".
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Most vampire movies are up for a little camp. By comparison, Dracula Untold erects a complete tent city.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Armour-clanging, cloak-swishing tosh with okay battles, terrible dialogue and sadly little horror or heroism.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Shore eventually delivers the blood and thunder we've been waiting for.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> The surprise? It's really not so bad.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> It's pretty ludicrous and silly and I found the dialogue was so cliched and some of the shots as well. However, I think Luke Evans is a really charismatic performer.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The main crime committed by the film is that it isn't scary and it isn't suspenseful; despite all the blood and gore and clever make-up, it's resolutely unengaging.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Breathes new life into an otherwise tired stomping ground, taking this story back hundreds of years and delving into the unknown origin story of the innovator himself, Mr. Dracula.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The cast sink their teeth in but the resulting film is surprisingly bloodless.
771355228 <###> Dracula Untold <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Lacks passion and personality, trying to straddle the line between comic-book action and gothic horror yet failing to be effective at either one.
771034546 <###> Japan Japan <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Unusual? Yes. Satisfying? Well, you kinda have to be in the mood for that sort of thing.
771034546 <###> Japan Japan <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The restless, mini-DV-camera-shot visual style of Lior Shamriz's semi-improvised fiction matches the wanderlust of its twentysomething gay hero.
770726430 <###> Always Will <###> Drama;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Always Will is what family entertainment should always be: thought provoking, involving, truthful, rich with wonderful characters.
12443 <###> Blame It on the Bellboy <###> Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> An attempt at farce set in Venice and involving three people with similar sounding last names and an Italian bellboy
12443 <###> Blame It on the Bellboy <###> Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> Can I instead Blame it on Mark Herman?
12443 <###> Blame It on the Bellboy <###> Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Blame it on the screenplay.
12443 <###> Blame It on the Bellboy <###> Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's lowbrow humor for the masses, and as such, it succeeds quite well.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> What a pleasant surprise to discover that the film has earned its sweeping title.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> A funny frankenstein that's worth seeing just to point and laugh at.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.875 <###> "Australia" occasionally stumbles into corny sidesteps like Hugh Jackman's "Oh, crikey" catchphrase. But Baz Luhrmann mythologized his homeland as American directors like John Ford did with Westerns - dramatic-license exaggerations that pay off in droves.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> Australia is an enchanting throwback to an era of filmmaking which strived to entertain its audiences with dazzling spectacle and melodrama.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.7 <###> Whilst it's not the masterpiece we so desperately wanted it to be, Australia still manages to be a good time at the cinema.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> It's a bit overloaded, though I love Luhrmann's obvious enthusiasm.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> Here's a film you probably sneered at as its ads played for its mega-plex roll out. I beg you not to let you keep that from now buying the DVD.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> It is a huge film - in scale, scope, look and feel, and of course budget. It is also a huge disappointment.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.74 <###> Sometimes seems to be overwhelmed by Baz Luhrmann's excess, but the strength of his vision, the appeal of his visuals and the skill of his actors keep the film from capsizing.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Unfortunately, between its predictably and the absence of chemistry between Kidman and Jackman, Australia amounts to little more than an amusing if just as readily-forgettable diversion.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.4 <###> A busca de Australia por uma identidade cinematografica acaba levando o filme a oscilar perigosamente entre tons terrivelmente dispares.

770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.625 <###> Unashamedly old-fashioned and corny, if not quite up to the director's usual high standards.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> Often beautiful but wildly inconsistent, Australia is none more Baz Luhrmann, which perhaps says it all. Worth a look on the big screen, though.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> It's a fine romp, epic in both ambition and visuals if not narrative - and if director Baz Luhrmann had stopped at the end of the love story's trajectory, the audience would have left entirely happy.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> Australia is an epic love story, and a quite extraordinary piece of kitsch. Everything about the film is wildly over the top.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.2 <###> We are left with slow-moving insincerity and conceit, summoned up in the flatulence of that title: Australia, a country reborn in terms of facetious Hollywood cliches.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> Australia would love to be The African Queen, but is more The Australian Prince Charles: silly, longwinded, heart in the right place.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> It's anything but cool. It's warm, it has a big heart, and if you look at it in the right light, it's really rather beautiful.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> Some of it doesn't work, but it remains a gloriously ambitious romantic epic and a truly memorable big-screen movie experience.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.4 <###> Nothing wrong with a film's reach exceeding its grasp, but Luhrmann's ambition has left this one looking forlorn and exposed: Australia clears a huge space for itself and then hasn't the wit or the wherewithal to fill it.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.4 <###> Australia is a film for which you have constantly to suspend your disbelief. I did for some of the way, but in the end began to think it was a cross between the plonking Pearl Harbor and an expensive but routine sort of Oz western.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> Part western, part war movie and part epic romance, Baz Luhrmann's latest extravaganza is cheesy and ridiculous on several levels but it's also surprisingly enjoyable and never boring, despite its lengthy running time.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.4 <###> Jackman persuades as an Outback cowboy, Kidman's cut glass accent doesn't. Walters as Nullah is a great discovery. Australia is a soap opera of moods but eye candy Kidman is too fey a character to hold this diva show together.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Never quite locks together into the sweeping cinematic journey Luhrmann clearly set out to create.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> With plot is similar to a Barbara Stanwyck '50s Western by way of Out of Africa, Luhrmann directs Kidman in a surprisingly scene-chewing performance.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> an endurance test of good intentions and tangled ideas, exploited facts and fuzzy fictions, where the performances, like the plot, are slapped onto the beautiful backgrounds with the broadest - and clumsiest - of strokes.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> In his kitschy way, Luhrmann delivers the goods, even when his big moments inspire tears of laughter rather than emotion.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> The film is trying at times, but there is no question that the sheer spectacle of the film makes much of the consternation worth it.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> Luhrmann shamelessly indulges in the most sweeping style of filmmaking imaginable, filling the screen with expansive images, action and emotion, plus plenty of cheesy camp
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> Kitsch and cliche drive the story, but the faces and locations are stunning -- when the movie's over, you feel like you've been somewhere and seen something.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> The excess is part of its charm; Luhrmann sees the classic movie genres as a magical playground and he wants to play on all the rides.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.4 <###> Luhrmann... apparently decided this time to make about five movies at once, as Australia fluctuates wildly among many genres and many more different tones. And it's long. So, so long.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> Not just unashamedly old-fashioned, but altogether smug about it... For myself, I admire the defiant mustiness of the whole project.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> One wonders if there are any tablecloth cliches about Australia that have been missed.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.9 <###> Whether or not Baz Luhrmann's Australia is a great film, it is one hell of a movie.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Had the team abandoned the tediously tidy final third of the film and all the awful World War II shenanigans we obviously don't care about, Australia would be a wild romp.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> Baz Luhrmann's perfectly executed epic is a winner all the way. Kidman and Jackman are great but young Brandon Walters steals the show.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.375 <###> It has very little of [Moulin Rouge]'s irreverence or nose-thumbing spirit, opting instead for a stubborn adherence to the tenets of the budget-busting Hollywood prestige pictures of the 1950s and 1960s.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> With three storylines, a ludicrous performance by Kidman, and Baz's self-indulgence getting the best of him, AUSTRALIA is one of this year's biggest blunders.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.7 <###> It's not the masterpiece we've been waiting for, but Australia is still an ambitious, at times even awesome, movie experience.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5625 <###> You don't find many three-hour fairy tale love story war films about race relations featuring the ultra-competitive beef market in northern Australia. For good reason.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.875 <###> A film as grand as the Down Under itself.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> Australia isn't "Titanic 2.0," but neither is it "Heaven's Gate.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.7 <###> With measured visual flash, Luhrmann highlights the delightful presence of his two stars and realizes an unlikely feelgood film, in spite of its grave matters.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> Sumptuous and romantic, Australia is a gorgeous, ambitious epic achieved with Baz Luhrmann's inimitable style. Kidman and Jackman are at their best and awfully nice to look at. What's not to love?
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Australia, director Baz Luhrmann's sweeping, romantic epic that takes place in the outback during the World War II-era, is exactly like the Energizer Bunny: It keeps going and going and going.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> A note-worthy attempt but it's hard to ignore all the inconsistencies in this movie -- like the thrown-in fish-out-of-water segment about the Wizard of the Oz.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.625 <###> An old-fashioned, screen-filling picture that is at times as rousing and untamed as the continent that it depicts.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.625 <###> We could have had something really representing the vibrant Aussie film industry.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> Baz' latest might differ from his Red Curtain Trilogy by doing away with the overt theatricality, madcap visuals and musical numbers, but it's still driven by his infectious love of every aspect of filmmaking.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> AUSTRALIA is a film that's simply way too earnest for our cynical age.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Swells of emotion & panoramic stampedes fill the screen; however, meandering scenes in between have been cut out at the seams so often, you'll be wandering what it all means.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Although visually interesting, this latest from Baz Luhrmann is all over a map bigger than Australia.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> Recreates the old pleasure of discovering an epic en masse...One moment in particular elicited a mass groan of ecstasy from our packed audience, which then elicited empathetic giggles from everyone.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.625 <###> Like the kangaroo that goes from a newcomer's sightseeing delight to dinner meat with the sudden crack of a rifle shot, Australia hops all over the place.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> The epic scope of the filmmaking gives you newfound appreciation for what a visionary filmmaker can achieve when given the chance to make films without compromise.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> The massive panoramas of wild Australia suddenly make Luhrmanns wild flourishes look puny.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Australia tries to be a sprawling, romantic epic. Instead, it's a melodramatic exercise in tedium.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.625 <###> At once sprawling and intimate, melodramatic and comic, magnificent and utterly bonkers, it bears entertaining witness to Luhrmann's love of old movies and his Down Under homeland.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.333333333333 <###> Are we so desperate to sate our malnourished nostalgia for movie magic that we'd settle for a facsimile so grand, lavish and empty?
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.625 <###> As ridiculous as Australia often is, it's also ridiculously entertaining.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.25 <###> [Luhrmann] veers from earnest drama to brisk comedy and then tries to hold it together with awkward voiceover narration. Within five minutes, Australia seems headed for trouble. It gets there and stays there.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.625 <###> It looks great, but the same comment can be made about Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor, which shares more than a passing resemblance.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Long in the making -- and almost as long in the watching -- Baz Luhrmann's Australia is epic piffle.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> This film is a long love song written in two parts, and these actors duet nicely.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.625 <###> The worst culprit of overacting is David Wenham, whose dastardly henchman Fletcher ends up perhaps the most risible movie villain since Billy Zane's Cal Hockley took shots at Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack Dawson as the Titanic sank into the chilly depths.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.625 <###> Never boring but often exhausting, Australia finally pulls itself together for an emotionally satisfying ending. Or six. Pass the gravy.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Australia is being marketed as the kind of old-fashioned romantic epic Hollywood rarely makes anymore, and after you've sat through it, you'll be thankful they don't.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> Australia is something of a mess, though it's a spectacularly made mess that's carried along by its ambition and artistry and, most of all, its pure passion to please.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> A big mess: emotionally incoherent, laughably simplistic and narratively graceless.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> Either there's a huge inside joke at work in Australia, or else the movie is just corny and weird. We liked watching it enough to vote for the first interpretation.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> Comedy and tragedy, action and melodrama, full measures of quirk and swoon: It's just a plain good time at the movies.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Australia is so damnably eager to please that it feels like being pinned down by a giant overfriendly dingo and having your face licked for about three hours: theoretically endearing but, honestly, kind of gross.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> What a gorgeous film, what strong performances, what exhilarating images and -- yes, what sweeping romantic melodrama.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Australia only covers about two years in that continent's history. But as long as the movie feels, you'd swear it covered a decade ... or even a century.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> Even more than a Western, Australia is a musical without a songbook. Its emotions are large, its rhythms bold.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.7 <###> A moviemaker as creative as [Baz] Luhrmann should make more movies. If nothing else, Australia proves he needs the practice.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.625 <###> Australia strains to do it all, and finally all you can see is the strain.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.375 <###> Australia, set in Australia's Northern Territory, a land of romance and adventure, should have been a terrific epic, but instead is a lavish family time-killer.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> Messy but engrossing epic about race, love, and war.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> It's an ode to a place (exotic to some, familiar to others), yes, but more than that, Australia is state of mind: wonderment, grandeur, beauty, love, escape, hope.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.625 <###> Clearly intended as a big blockbuster, to call it merely entertaining is damning it with faint praise.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.7 <###> If for some reason you hate the song, 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' you must avoid this film. Otherwise, it's a crowd pleaser, especially the fairytale-like first half
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> ...wants to sweep previous sweeping historical romances off their feet.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> I liked the characters, and I liked the actors, even if it didn't sweep me away.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Baz Luhrmann's Australia is a sweeping, grand epic in the tradition of Gone With the Wind that gets away from its talented director, the writers he worked with and the team he hired to film his passion project.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> An enormous, exotic, exhilarating frontier adventure that is, in its weight and grand ambition, on the epic scale of 'Gone With the Wind.'
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> That's it's not confrontational or deconstructionist may seem rebellious on paper, but blown up on the big screen for nearly three hours, Australia sure plays as purely conventional.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> It is a pleasure, and not a guilty one, to place ourselves in the hands of a mischievous director who wants to push screen dimensions back to the era of CinemaScope, Technicolor and stereophonic sound.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.4 <###> Australia is sloppy, way too long, has awful dialogue, some bad special effects and very annoying characters.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> Australia is a pastiche of genres and references wrapped up into one horse-galloping, cattle-stampeding, camera-swooping, music-swelling, widescreen package.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> The singular vision of Luhrmann is to experience Australia and fall in love with the possibility of grand movies all over again.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Beautiful scenery and the best intentions can't save Australia from dissolving in goo.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Australia offers everything from a cattle drive to Nicole Kidman's rendition of "Over the Rainbow" to hordes of Japanese Zeros zeroing in on screaming children during the early 1942 attack on Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory, two months aft
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> An epic that's cute when it should be sweeping and richer in Aboriginal mysticism than genuine cinematic magic.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.2 <###> Part melodrama, part live-action cartoon, and entirely awful ...
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> Watching Luhrmann swinging for the fences and missing is still a hell of a lot more entertaining than watching most other contemporary filmmakers hitting their usual singles and doubles.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.3 <###> Australia is what you get when the film projector overheats and the only thing that comes out is pure corn syrup.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.25 <###> By unnecessarily extending the film (and shortening what should have formed its crux), Australia manages the almost unfeasible feat of becoming a less honest film than Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Crikey, this is a long movie.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> It's as big and bold and unabashedly old-fashioned as anything since Titanic, and as with that film, you'll forgive its excesses and revel in its sweep.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> There's enough material in Australia to warrant a mini-series, which is how the feature film plays out. In one sitting, it's a tough sit.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> It's not Luhrmann's best work to date, but it has crowd-rousing flair to spare.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.875 <###> While it takes chutzpah to name a film after an entire continent, Australia is as vastly entertaining as Australia is vast.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.25 <###> Baz Luhrmann's Titanic.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> A technical triumph in search of a heart that feels real.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> Baz Luhrmann's epic story of love and adventure isn't quite the classic it hopes to be, but it paints a vivid portrait of the titular continent on the brink of World War II.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> Baz Luhrmann's entertaining Australia simply must be watched on the biggest screen possible, as I imagine it becomes sillier and sillier as it shrinks.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Halfway through, Australia veers sharply into Serious Issue mode.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Australia is an unbroken string of cliches. Director Luhrmann does the obvious at every turn, making each character an archetype and every action a crowd-pleasing, grandiosely predictable moment.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.4 <###> Though Luhrmann starts with plenty of potential, he squanders it almost immediately.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> If Luhrmann takes too long to tell the tale, it is at least a tale worth telling, shining a light on racism and mistreatment, folding it neatly into a crowded film that entertains us for most of the way.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> If it sounds shallow and predictable, Australia is, in fact, anything but.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> It's messy and overwrought. But ambition this grand is worth two hours and 40 minutes of Aussie scenery, history (fudged), romance and war.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> Call it a little show on a big stage, or tiny brushes on a huge canvas. But you also have to call it disappointing.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> A spellbinding, old-fashioned adventure story and romantic drama with many magical moments of high drama, emotional catharsis, and awesome cinematic beauty.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> An unwieldy stab at an old-fashioned movie epic, Baz Luhrmann's Australia is corny, implausible, well intentioned and even somewhat enjoyable in its own way, at least for a while.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> it has the uncanny ability to manipulate its audience into involuntary oohs and ahhs even while provoking it by using every hoary plot device imaginable
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.7 <###> It takes a continent's worth of nerve and extravagance to make a film like this in this way, throwing melodramatic romance, greed, racism and aboriginal spirituality into the fantasy mix.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> It sounds like a mess because it is one. A gorgeous, earnest, reckless, and brazenly captivating mess.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.5 <###> This costly, much-troubled, forever-in-production epic nonetheless falls short of its lofty ambitions; undone by an unfortunate combination of hubris, predictable studio meddling and fate.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.7 <###> The film's rapid changes of tone often make for a bumpy ride.
770671914 <###> Australia <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.666666666667 <###> A very loud, crazily colourful and delightfully strings-free romp -- fun while it lasted and fondly recalled, but not, alas, the big love we yearned for.

770671912 <###> Up <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> For any run-of-the-mill movie studio, Up would represent a major achievement. But this is Pixar we're talking about ... and so the standards have to be a little tougher.

770671912 <###> Up <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Saying Up ranks somewhere right in the middle is like dissing the bottom half of the top 10 titles that any genre has to offer.

770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Basically, it's a videogame masquerading as a movie, but the action scenes are so loud and messily edited that they're tedious rather than tense.

770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> It's brainless fun, but while Anderson's brilliant staging of the flesh-ripping stunts surpasses Bartel's cheap thrills, this update lacks the sardonic wit and satirical bite of the Corman-produced version.

770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> The discombobulated violence that ensues is nihilistic, gratuitous and numb-skulled -- perfect for an action fossil that, despite its near-future setting, is all pre-CGI, pre-eco-friendly horsepower.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.125 <###> Car-crash porn for the modern audience.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.35 <###> Despite all of the action, fists, gunfire, explosions and more, it ends up just driving in circles, constantly banging into the uninspired barriers of mediocrity before crashing in a heap of bad filmmaking.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> What plot exists here is so nonsensical, so hackneyed that it doesn't deserve or need explanation.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> What fans of the original will immediately glean from the quasi-remake, now simply titled Death Race, is just how prophetic Bartel's film was and how desperately the new film needs its forebear's sense of irony.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> If you like primitive, degrading mayhem, this will fulfill your needs.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Thanks to its character interplay, the movie doesn't drag despite taking a good 40 minutes to really rev its engines. And the racing that ensues is as loud, fast, hyper-edited, and pulverizingly destructive as the gladiatorially minded would hope.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Blood, gore. Unlimited machine gun and cannon fire. Bombs exploding. Tires screeching, brakes squealing glass breaking, crash, after meaningless crash. What's not to like?
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> This is still summer trash and no brain cells were injured or even fatigued in the making of it.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Even though the original film was made more than 30 years ago on a short schedule and a miniscule budget, its scenes of car-based carnage are actually more exciting and cinematically inventive than the messes on display here.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> ...it doesn't bore, and it doesn't embarrass the actors who appear in it. For a late summer action flick, that's high praise indeed.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Yes, Death Race is as brutal as a punch in the face. If you have a hankering for B-movie grime and gore, it can also be a lot of fun.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> No fancy talk here, just solid, monosyllabic obscenities; no flights of digital fancy, just souped-up monster cars flipping end over end in a napalm blaze and crashing in a crunch of flaming metal ouch.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.125 <###> It is an assault on all the senses, including common. Walking out, I had the impression I had just seen the video game and was still waiting for the movie.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> Director Paul W.S. Anderson is one of Hollywood's most consistent directors - he can always be counted on to make a terrible movie.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The movie makes no demands on its audience, except to cheer in all the right places.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Like big steaming chunks of charred animal flesh, or a fleeting glimpse of a gal's ample cleavage, Death Race taps into something very primal (and very male) about the action movie experience.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Even though DEATH RACE is pretty bloody, and had some cool moments, the overall experience is mind numbing and a little depressing. It's sad to think that this is Anderson's best effort since 2002, and that it's still as bad as ever.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Yes, it's a big ball of stupid, and yes, it's pretty damn fun.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> The flick is mindless fun. Any guy who wears Chuck Taylors, kills people in amazing ways and just spouts off amazing dialogue is totally cool in my book.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The movie is almost a lot of fun, were it not for the fact that Anderson lacks a knack for clarity and lightness; he shakes the camera too much and cuts so fast that the race becomes a blur.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.125 <###> We're in for a bumpy ride on Anderson's Bi-polar express where the line between homage and ripoff is never as blurry as his action sequences. His Ben-Hur chariot race would have needed nothing more than one set of horses, a couple human heads and a wheel.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.125 <###> Made for that dude down near the front of the theater who screams out, "DAAAAAMN," every time a character meets his untimely demise. Either you're that guy or you are not.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Brit writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson obviously realizes that he isn't there to make Hamlet. He's got a job to do and he does it effectively and competently.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Death Race roars, rages and races down the track, all velocity and visceral violence, unencumbered by logic, sense, reason or dignity.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> exists so critics will have something to put on their year-end "Worst Of" lists.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Mmmmmm... it tastes like sleaze.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Death Race may be a loud, lowbrow piece of pulp, but it's also crackling entertainment -- the very definition of a cheap thrill.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Death Race is a cinematic dreadnought: imposing on the surface, hollow at its core.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> Low-rent, boring, brazenly mindless garbage.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> It's one of those vicious larks that just plain hit the spot. It hits the spot, throws 'er into reverse and hits the spot again, before machine-gunning it and ramming it head-on for the fun of it.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Death Race should at least score points for its title, which is more apt than, say, Feelings Exploration. It's mostly a race, and there's a lot of death.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Anderson's take is ultraviolent, ridiculously stupid and kind of a rush. If your brain has an 'off' switch, you're well-advised to use it. And the carnage is relentless.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Bravely takes on that philosophical quandary every one of us must face: What to do when a ninja breaks into your home, frames you for the murder of your wife and taunts you with a finger-gun motion?
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> Paul W. S. Anderson's noisy, nonsensical remake fails to hold together even in its own paper-thin world.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> ...too brutal and boorish to be a guilty pleasure. It's just guilty
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> A serviceable, forgettable genre film marked by leaden performances, even more leaden dialogue, a few sterlingly gruesome images, and a supremely campy performance from Joan Allen.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.0 <###> A guy movie for guys whose only turn-on is death.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.0 <###> One of the most boring drags of all time.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Anderson - not to be confused with Paul Thomas Anderson, the fearlessly ambitious director of 'Magnolia' and 'There Will Be Blood' - has created a movie worthy of its own video game.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Exactly what you might expect, a mindless action flick that allows you to cheer as people get slaughtered while racing around in armored cars ... anyone expecting anything [else] is obviously in the wrong movie.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> DEATH RACE is going to please non-demanding moviegoers that love their flicks violent and action-packed. But this is like eating a generic brand of cereal, tastes okay until you have the real thing again.
770671911 <###> Death Race <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Paul W.S. Anderson may have a lot of flaws as a filmmaker, but the man knows cheap thrills, and he delivers them here.
770759861 <###> Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.5 <###> More or less what you'd have if Ingmar Bergman had shot The Blair Witch Project...
770759861 <###> Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.8 <###> Severed Ways exudes a specific and unique vibe, and youre either going to get into it or youre not...If youre willing to just stop, look and listen, you might have a good time.
770759861 <###> Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.5 <###> Stone's admirable and persuasive evocation is unfortunately marred by his self-defeating resort to flurries of claustrophobic, fragmented hand-held shots that obfuscate just about every crucial plot development in the film.
770759861 <###> Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.7 <###> That director Tony Stone concocted and nearly pulls off this gruff, truly indie flick, maintaining our interest -- mostly -- through slow, wordless curio makes him a director to watch.
770759861 <###> Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.5 <###> Captivating locations can't overcome deplorable scenes of defecation and actually killing a hen onscreen. This is so slow and lacking in pace it tries one's patience.
770759861 <###> Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.3 <###> A pretentious, tedious, jarring and grueling test of a viewer's patience.
770759861 <###> Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> Severed Ways is one of the oddest movies I've seen in a while -- and that's a good thing.
770759861 <###> Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.6 <###> If nothing else, Mr. Stone, from his tangled hair to dirty feet, has taken himself and his story into the beyond -- way, way beyond.
770759861 <###> Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.333333333333 <###> Largely lacking in dialogue (if not unintentional hilarity), this intensely personal project is proof positive that Bill and Ted grew up to become filmmakers.
770759861 <###> Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.375 <###> Seems more informed by low-budget History Channel programs and the proto-metal Norse lore of Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song."
771412465 <###> Somewhere Only We Know <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> In style and sensibility, [it] echoes another recent Chinese "chick flick", 20 Once Again. Both films are aimed at a youth market, yet both have a conservative slant, encouraging the younger generation to retain the prudent virtues of times gone by.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Under no circumstances would I call Inherent Vice a bad film. It's too weird and fascinating and filled with too many delightful performances...
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> This preposterously funny hippie-noir is a warm, back-to-the-'70's journey of paranoia and intrigue, dentists and dope - a kind of fin de siecle of the Californian '60s.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> A Lebowski-esque adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's novel that's as bewildering as it is entertaining.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.2 <###> The title for this film should have been Incoherent Vice, such is the unfunny, meandering, deliberately confusing plot scribble of Paul Thomas Anderson's attempt at a 1970s crime comedy...seems designed to both infuriate and bore.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Crazy enough to entertain while illuminating the sad reality of never quite getting what you want.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> It isn't one film but many, an anthology of expertly recreated genre tropes, from fog-shrouded noir to sunlit paranoia.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Movies don't need to be better than the book. They only need to be the best movie version of the book. And Inherent Vice is that.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Tune in, drop out, and let this superb hippy noir wash over you.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Anderson is too enamored with his terrific ensemble cast. Perhaps 2 hours 20 minutes were needed for the plot to make any kind of sense, but there still feels like a lot of dead weight, and he is unable to infuse it with the energy of his other films.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> PTA, Pynchon, Phoenix and co. produce something unavoidably brilliant.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> the film's convoluted plot and lack of genuine feeling for the characters undercut even its most impressive sequences, making it feel empty where it should be boisterous, boring when it should be at the very least intriguing
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> On a strictly impressionistic first watch I intensely hated it.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Paul Thomas Anderson's dark-comedy adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's crime-noir/counterculture novel is a thing of cinematic achievement. And it's also one heck of a trip, man.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> I found myself going with it for about two thirds of the time, seduced by its sweetness, suspicious of its sexuality ... occasionally exasperated by its incessant shaggy-doggedness.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> A faithful adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel that feels as if a labyrinthine Raymond Chandler thriller has been thrown into a cocktail shaker with Alice In Wonderland.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> For those of us who cleave to the old-fashioned view that narratives should be vaguely penetrable, the film might as well be retitled Incoherent Vice.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> I think I need to see it again, again.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> A noble failure, perhaps, but whatever you make of its unwieldy plot machinations, Inherent Vice's smoky Californian atmosphere is guaranteed to rouse your senses.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Inherent Vice does gets over-entangled, but, despite the pot haze, a credible plot emerges and Anderson chalks up another triumph.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Watching Paul Thomas Anderson's wonderfully textured and intricate LA-set Inherent Vice, you are easily reminded of the famous story about Howard Hawks' version of The Big Sleep.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice provides a rush of pure hallucinogenic pleasure, but its logic is mighty hard to follow.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The less you try to figure out Anderson's rambling, mesmerising mystery, the better. Just relax and let this beautiful, haunting, hilarious, chaotic, irritating and possibly profound tragicomedy wash over you.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> As rich and strange as we've come to expect from the "late" Anderson films, but doesn't quite achieve the digressive whackadoo majesty of the novel.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> A delirious triumph: a stylish-squared meeting of creative minds, a swirl of hypnosis and symbiosis, with Pynchon's prose partly assigned to a narrating character and partly diversified into funky dialogue exchanges.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> How will this play in the non-Pynchon community? Not at all, sez us. But for the converted or the plain curious, it's something to see, if not cherish.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> The film's charms and strengths are undeniable... but none of it is enhanced by the bloated last hour, or the logy overall pace.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> It's a noble failure, felt all the more because Anderson's films are usually so aesthetically and thematically rich and rewarding...
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Shot in sun-bleach, faded 35mm stock, with a view of California deeply entrenched in cinematic folklore, Inherent Vice is an easy film to fall for.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> A richly intoxicating brew of humour, violence and melancholy.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Like the Thomas Pynchon novel on which it's based, Inherent Vice is an anti-thriller, a loose, lunatic, sun-scorched noir that just keeps piling on the madness.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Pynchon and Anderson's take on this period is more subversive, but also more of a lament than HST's ether binge.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> This is uniquely a Paul Thomas Anderson picture, another expression of his formidable artistry and singular vision.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> When you stop looking at the forest, you'll see the beauty in the trees.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> An unstructured, atmospheric affair ostensibly designed to appeal to folks nostalgic for the hedonistic hippie era.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> A detective story in which a skunky marijuana fog replaces the acrid haze of gun smoke and the spill of stems and seeds is more likely than the spill of blood.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Anderson moves further from conventional storytelling with each new film, and closer to something more intuitive, more damning, more true. He hasn't made it there yet. God help us when he does.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> First things first: the plot doesn't matter. It it all adds up to a breathtaking achievement- my pick for the best film of 2014.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> I had a lot of fun watching this.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Anderson's protagonists long for something different - prosperity, virility, respect, love. For Doc, it's a day when, as Jim Morrison said, "everything was simpler & more confused." His pursuit is witty, wise, ambitious & close to stoned immaculate.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> It's an oddball movie about a bunch of oddballs.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> This isn't for the mainstream at all. Instead, Inherent Vice is for the die-hard P.T. Anderson fan, the kind of fan that studies every frame of his films.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> With so little at stake and a plot that only kind-of-sort-of makes any sense, what Anderson has accomplished is the cinematic equivalent of being stoned (or so I'm told).
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Inherent Vice locates a mystery worthy of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe and basically sends in Cheech and Chong to crack the case.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> ...a dreamy movie that's all about the textures, the flat valley light glancing off the David Hockney planes. It's a movie that revels in its moviedom even as it replicates, in a very naturalistic way, a particular time and place.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> A dense and dreamy trip to the end of the 1960s.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Over this 2.5-hour movie's long haul, the nowhere-bound plot strands don't congeal.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Ignore the stoner humor and hackneyed cliches and appreciate the mood and setting of this most neo of the neo-noirs.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Instead of melting into the holes of the story like so much warm butter, the audience gets scraped across Anderson's room-temperature toast. There's no chemical reaction, which has the effect of leaving the audience cold.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Vice will be remembered as minor Anderson. But even greats can use a romp or two in their oeuvres.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Joaquin Phoenix is perfectly cast as the perpetually befuddled Doc, a private detective of sorts who immerses himself in pot in the Los Angeles of 1970.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Although it's not as hermetic and impenetrable as The Master, Inherent Vice still comes off as a giant inside joke to anyone who hasn't read Pynchon's novel.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Great acting salts this complex mystery involving drug-addled bottom feeders in 1970s Los Angeles. It goes nowhere but typical of Paul Thomas Anderson, nowhere is riveting.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The filmmaker paints a blurry picture of a doped-up dope on a quest to find, well, I don't know. More drugs? Himself? Closure? Does Doc even know, or care? Should we?
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> The film becomes something of a meandering mess of scenes that never adds up to a cohesive whole, stretching on and on for an unforgivable two and a half hours.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> It is difficult to imagine how Paul Thomas Anderson devised the finished product. His visual connectivity, romantic filmic sensibility, and electric narrative drive have vanished without a trace in a thick, aimless, drug-filled fume of smoke.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Inherent Vice is a sun-glared, neon-limned muddle of noir plotline and potheaded jokery that not only doesn't make sense, but actually seems to try hard not to.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Anderson is an auteur's auteur, and his movies are always lovingly shot and uniquely conceived. "Inherent Vice" is no different.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> A stoner's delight that is part fever dream and part bad trip, Inherent Vice is a dark and wickedly wild neo-noir romp. But it's also a thing of unusual density and often incoherence.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.25 <###> Each scene introduces a new character with little explanation, all but abandoning the previous new face that was just presented. It's like that "Too Many Cooks" video minus the entertainment value.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> [Inherent Vice] takes its own sweet time to get places. And sometimes you might wonder if we actually needed to go to all of those places in the first place.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Patience Required to Appreciate Anderson's "Vice."

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> "Inherent Vice" is an aggressively weird movie, which you should take not as a warning but as a compliment and an invitation to see it, to let its stoner vibes wash all over you.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Paul Thomas Anderson's hippie noir seems completely stoned: inarticulate, confused and prone to giggling at unknown jokes. Pynchon fans might tolerate it.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Both times I saw "Inherent Vice," I experienced roughly the same contradictory responses: delight undercut by puzzlement, followed by a happier sort of puzzlement.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> A run-on sentence of a puzzle of a fog, wonderfully disoriented and right in line with the behind-the-beat curiosity Phoenix brings to Doc.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Inherent Vice is sensible and senseless, not as much a story as an experience of one.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> More than just an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's 2009 novel, the film engages with the author's literature on the whole, attempting a filmic analogue to his virtuosic prose.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> A lot of people are going to bend over backwards to give Anderson's latest a rave review. But all you have to do is watch it alongside Boogie Nights to see how far Inherent Vice falls short.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Some may find it sour and even repulsive, with its pathological anarchy of flavours. Some will find it delicious, in a deliriously exotic manner. Count me in the second camp.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.25 <###> A rare (and total) misfire from Paul Thomas Anderson...
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> The plot is a sideshow to Inherent Vice's luxuriant atmosphere, cracked sense of humor, and idiosyncratic characterization.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Anderson's great accomplishment here is that he's created a work where there's no past, no future--there only is, man. Groovy.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Too often, the film gets distracted with things to giggle at, and breaks the spell.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Though it's radically befuddling, the movie is full of surprises, some of them hilarious, inventive, evocative and sexy (frontal nudity and a copulation scene included).

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice is a postcard of the sun going down on California. On second viewing, it was a majestic drift that took me out to sea.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> At first glance, Inherent Vice might seem to be a detective story. Look a little closer, however, and it becomes clear that this is Paul Thomas Anderson's idea of a comedy.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.2 <###> Hollow and pointless - a better title would have been 'Incoherent Vice.'

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> [P.T. Anderson] is a terrific stylist ... and the scattershot pleasures he's peddling in 'Inherent Vice' may well satisfy those who like style more than substance, or maybe who like their style with substances.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> So, yes, if you watch inherent Vice as a whodunnit, you'll be disappointed -- but if you watch not as a whodunnit but rather as a whahappened, it's a film that's both funny and freaky, a pitch-perfect portrait of a time that never was.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> "Inherent Vice" is a film about a stoner which itself seems stoned. This is just one small part of what makes it distinctive.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> This is material more apt for a Coen Brothers treatment. Two-and-a-half hours of pretty, Paul Thomas Anderson-sculpted nonsense is a lot to take.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.05 <###> Anderson succeeds in creating a world all its own, rich in atmosphere and detail... Phoenix holds the film together with his amusing performance as a guy who doesn't take himself too seriously.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Inherent Vice, brilliantly scored by Jonny Greenwood, is an Anderson head trip, impure jazz with a reverb that can leave you dazed, confused and even annoyed.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.87 <###> This film [is] one that must be seen again, if not to better understand it, then to remember the sweet feeling of reveling in its haze.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Anderson, as always, knows exactly what he's doing with the camera. Scenes are often staged in the haze of smoke or fog; sometimes characters are introduced late into the frame, or action happens just out of it.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Phoenix's extraordinary performance pulls the movie's infinite strands together. But this twisty tale takes so many foggy turns that you'll want to approach it with a plan.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> "Inherent Vice," meandering even by Anderson's standards, is easily the worst of his movies, a soporific 2 /&#8322;- hour endurance test.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Anderson had long wanted to adapt Pynchon--this marks the first movie to do so. Is it successful? That depends on what you demand from an L.A. detective mystery.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> A wildly entertaining, beautiful and hypnotic puzzler from a towering talent, Inherent Vice proves to be so much more than just the best film of the year - though it is that too.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.95 <###> There's an inherent wisdom to Inherent Vice that escapes the groovy episodes, farcical humor and pea soup atmosphere, and transforms a nearly perfect piece of entertainment into something truly powerful.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Inherent Vice has a dazzling and often entertaining atmosphere of debasement, like a smiley face rotting from the inside. Yet there's a real limit to its pleasure.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Immersive and occasionally incoherent, stoner mystery Inherent Vice is a bold step for filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson that unfortunately doesn't match the brilliance of his earlier films.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> As with Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love, the director has created another vivid Los Angeles, one that doesn't lean too hard on its pop-culture references to TV's Adam-12 or Neil Young's gentle Harvest album.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Ask not where the film is leading; that's hardly the point. The plot amounts to an arrangement of red herrings and besides, solutions are for squares.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> a hilariously complex stoner noir that weaves around its massive web of characters utilizing a tone that's at times overtly slapstick, yet also deeply spiritual and romantic.
771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> The dangers of filmmakers trying to replicate a golden era rather than embrace the present are part and parcel of Inherent Vice, but the ramifications are political as well.

771325708 <###> Inherent Vice <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.35 <###> P.T. Anderson's most uninspired work to date and mostly a worthless waste of time.

770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> With little more than one actor, a mobile phone, a (very full) Zippo and a few disembodied voices, director Rodrigo Cortes has created a 95-minute panic-attack-made-movie.

770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Buried may well be an allegory for the fates of so many Americans waylaid in sandier climes, but it works first and foremost as an experiential horror film -- the best of its kind in some time.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Reynolds is riveting, and it's possible to appreciate Cortes's bravura cinematic accomplishment. But that'll come much later, after you catch your breath.

770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> Rodrigo Cortes's film is rigidly grim and relentlessly discomforting - thanks to superior sound design, creatively claustrophobic camerawork and a one-man-show from Ryan Reynolds, who leaves no room for sarcasm in this sarcophagus.

770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Buried achieves the rare feat of being both deliriously enjoyable and relentlessly unpleasant. The film -- a furious fusion of Phone Booth, Wait Until Dark, 1408 and Cube -- is a ninety-minute test of endurance.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Buried works not because Ryan Reynolds is good (he is) but because director Rodrigo Cortes is even better.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> ... a clever topical adaptation of the old Lucille Fletcher radio drama (and Barbara Stanwyck movie) Sorry, Wrong Number ...

770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> Somewhere, Edgar Allan Poe is uncorking a bottle of Amontillado and laughing himself silly.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.85 <###> Sometimes Cortes gets carried away with his "angry little film criticizing the world", but hell, when you?re stuck making a movie in a box, it?s easy to see why you?d want to stand up, raise your arms and yell as loud as possible.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> Best ending of the year.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> There?s just not enough material here to sustain a 90-minute movie.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> Cortes similarly crafts a heightened sense of awareness out of the less-is-more scenario. The result is a skillful thriller with a strong point of view that is also confident in its use of genre flourishes.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> This is as un-Hollywood a role as you could ever get, but [Reynolds] nails both the compressed physicality and fried psyche of his character with palpable precision.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Reynolds is an irrepressibly (some might say irritatingly) verbal actor, so there?s something both genius and obscene about subjecting him to solitary confinement by cinema.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Rodrigo Cortes directs and Chris Sparling wrote the screenplay. They and Reynolds should be applauded. But you wonder who on earth is going to submit themselves to a film that is set exclusively in a coffin.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> All film-making is a manipulative art; Buried is just too overtly so.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> It's too long, it loses all sense of direction at the 60 minute mark, and so much of the action is phone-based that after a while it starts to feel like an audiobook.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> The tension keeps building, right to the end. Proving yet again that in movies, even though the space may get smaller, the picture doesn't have to.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> A part of me feels like why waste Ryan Reynolds and his hot abs in a film where he?s buried six feet under but another part of me loves how Buried flips off audiences by using a Hollywood celebrity in a manner that will only piss them off.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.9 <###> One must at a minimum concede that Buried boasts an elegant premise of inordinate simplicity.

770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> The skilful screenplay by Chris Sparling maintains the suspense right up to the will-he or wont-he get out ending, while slipping in some welcome black humour and a quietly effective message about state and corporate ruthlessness.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Buried is one of those movies that make a virtue of their limitations.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> There's something faintly quixotic about a filmmaker who, faced with technical limitations in a script, chooses to embrace them rather than fight them. Such is the case with Buried, an uncompromising suspense thriller from Spanish director Rodrigo Cortes.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> One of the film's great strengths is that Sparling's script doesn't pull any punches with the scenario.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.82 <###> Reynolds and Cortes have to make you believe that you're stuck in that box too, to make you feel, somewhere in your subconscious, that your quickened respirations are going to use up the air around you; and that's just what they manage to do.
770819772 <###> Buried <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> Who would have thought that Ryan Reynolds talking on a cell phone in a wooden box could be so damn thrilling?

771224184 <###> Take Shelter <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Shannon makes the man's dilemma plain and moving, and that gives Take Shelter a resonance that last long after the final fade out.
771224184 <###> Take Shelter <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Michael Shannon is brilliant. One of the big discoveries of this year's Sundance.
381422235 <###> Wallace and Gromit in A Close Shave <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> A comedic gem. A short with more laughs than most full-length films.
381422235 <###> Wallace and Gromit in A Close Shave <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Wallace and Gromit are always amazing. No surprise here.
381422235 <###> Wallace and Gromit in A Close Shave <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A techinical marvel and very funny.
771034059 <###> Beauty and the Beast: A Latter-Day Tale <###> Drama <###> 0.25 <###> Takes itself much too seriously, and as a result some of the supposedly dramatic moments are unintentionally hilarious.
771048847 <###> The Hunters <###> Documentary;Drama;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Family adventure has positive messages, but muddled story.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> This is the proper sequel to the 1997 original, and not the 2002 laugh-free abomination, Men in Black II.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Josh Brolin and a dose of Back to the Future breathe life and laughter back into the franchise.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's been ten years since the last underwhelming Men In Black movie and 15 long years since the brilliant original - and no one particularly asked to have it back.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The hip, knowing backdrop of these films - their winking acknowledgment that what you suspect about aliens is true - is more interesting than the run-of-the-mill plots scampering around in front of it.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Funny, if familiar. Energy and pacing are reasons it's able to skate by. It actually deepens the relationship between J and K, but it's still really a showcase for more of the same offbeat humor and imaginative special effects the first two are known for.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> "MIB 3" doesn't have the same see-it-for-the-first-time magic that the original had, and tonally, with Boris, it's a totally different animal. But it's just as strong of a film.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Discerning viewers will find problems with a few of the film's twists and turns, but moment to moment, there's still plenty of fun to be had with the Men in Black.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The effects and direction make this a pleasant diversion, but with a bunch of clunky one-liners and half-baked scenes this is a film that won't be remembered long.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Too often sci-fi epics miss the balance between spectacle and storytelling. While Men in Black 3 isn't always consistent in humour and pace, Sonnenfeld, with a well-considered script from David Koepp, manages to make it work.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.85 <###> This mostly solid sequel is a return to form for the series and just stellar enough to make it a must-see for fans of summer popcorn fare, no matter your age.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> "Men in Black 3" is fun and entertaining and shows hope that the series is not as dead as it seemed.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Like so many sequels, "MIB3" lacks the charisma of the original "Men In Black."
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> keep you interested enough to leave the cinema without feeling you've been cheated
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.45 <###> At some point in the future, probably not more than a couple of weeks, you'll realize that you barely remember seeing it.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Despite a rough start, "Men In Black 3" is still decent. It's mostly due to the likes of Josh Brolin and Michael Stuhlbarg's fantastic performances along with Rick Baker's exceptionally creative creature designs, but the ending packs an emotional punch.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Here's a case of a second sequel being better than the first because, well, it had to be...Thankfully, reliance on visual effects has been dialled down this time around for the sake of a decent story.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Smarter than its predecessors, and better-looking, 'Men in Black 3' is an entertaining and (I hope) touching wrap-up to the buddy film science-fiction franchise that began 15 years ago.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Beneath all the polish -- and Will Smith's considerable charm -- is a mediocre, lazily written story.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Sonnenfeld strikes a rich vein of comedy in production designer Bo Welch's imagining of the MIB in the 1960s.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.33 <###> Not even a melodramatic last minute twist or a reminder of race relations from half a century ago can inspire us to feel much for this parade of cheap humor and intentionally gaudy special effects.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Not nearly as silly as the others, the time warp gimmick works.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Intelligence and wit make MIB 3 a winner.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The actor and character that most humanizes the movie is Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, the alien with the gift of seeing potential futures. Griffin is both knowing and insecure. Stuhlbarg gives an affecting performance of warmth and fearful anxiety.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Dials down the creepy-crawly alien effects and ups the human element for this trip down the time tunnel, with a running theme of mortality, fatherhood and uncovering the mysteries of the past.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> In many ways, MIB3 is an old-fashioned, alien-hunting Saturday matinee movie - and that's how we saw it.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Director Barry Sonnenfeld was the cinematographer on Misery, Raising Arizona and Blood Simple - and there is no doubt he has a signature, comedic camera style that works for his material.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The main draw is the hanging out and goofing around, something Smith does really, exceedingly well.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> MiB3 isn't as good as the original, but it has a sufficient number of enjoyable moments and a delightful homage to Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K by Josh Brolin.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Sonnenfeld wisely plays to the strengths of the series' longevity, drawing some genuine emotion out of the buddy routine between slick-talking J and granite-faced K
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A clear improvement over its nigh disastrous predecessor...
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> While it's fairly watchable, it's not a particularly memorable film.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Third time's the charm; director Barry Sonnenfeld finally nails a story cool enough for the Men in Black.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.833333333333 <###> The back story plot works fine, but fans will enjoy what they love best about the MIB series - the visuals.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Most of the special effects are repeats of those seen in the first "MIB" movie and the only new element is Brolin's amazing performance as the young Tommy Lee Jones.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The standout here is Brolin, who nails Jones' mannerisms and vocal tics. Every time he calls Smith "slick," hondo" or "sport" you almost expect to see Jones standing behind him.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Silly, lightweight, completely unnecessary but surprisingly fun.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> A lazy, paceless lump of special effects and zero laughs
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.86 <###> The third act resolves into the thrill-park experience high-concept movies of this type typically become, before ending on a note of unexpected (and possibly uncanonical) sweetness. In the end, MIB3 is surprisingly touching. It may make you wet your eyes.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Despite having such a franchise-ready concept, it's becoming all the more clear that 1997's original MiB is a perfectly self-contained action comedy that needn't have been sequelized.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This third installment doesn't do anything notable enough to justify the franchise's revival, critically lacking in ambition, originality and narrative direction.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A fitting, franchise finale featuring all the fixins for a satisfying sendoff!
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Lighting has clearly escaped from the bottle.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Ultimately, it proves to be a bit long in the tooth, but a few bits manage to do the series proud.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Those expecting wanton alien bashing will not be disappointed ... but be prepared for more of a sentimental time-travelling journey down memory lane ...
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> An early surprise for the summer, Men in Black 3 defies the odds as a fun, flawed romp with an unexpectedly sweet, affecting climax. But they need to call it a day here.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The third film manages to remember what the second film forgot about the first film: be fun.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Not bad but not memorable, it seems to only exist as a kind of nostalgic revival piece, a belated attempt to wring one last curtain-call from a long-dead series.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> By the time the credits roll, Men in Black III makes you wish you, too, could travel back in time, skip the movie and see the original for the first time.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Brolin captures Jones' essence to such a high degree that he falls right into the old chemistry with Smith. It's a smooth transition, and happily, the old comedy team is back.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Men in Black III is far better than we had any right to expect.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> a lackluster, overly cheesy film desperately trying to grasp hold of something that was hip and cool more than a decade ago
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The good news is that it is an improvement over the previous film.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> High action, slick humor, raucous fun, MIB 3 is also a surprisingly thoughtful paean to the higher implications of pie, and to the miracle of chance that makes up the unified fabric of the past, present, and future.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> With a budget reported at $375 million, the latest project to incorporate Apollo 11 into its sci-fi rewrite of history represents one small step for cinema, one giant leap for creative accounting.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Men in Black III is a perfectly acceptable summer blockbuster, with all the frenetic action, visual inventiveness and lack of substance that has come to be associated with the phrase.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> This messy, overbearingly loud and barely diverting action comedy happens right in front of you. Then high-tails it out of your memory for good.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Did a third installment in this series need to exist? No, but it offers enough new variations on the formula to make me glad it does.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.845 <###> Surprisingly funny, smart and, dare I say, tender. The first great blockbuster of the summer.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The Smith-Jones duo's return as the titularly clad operatives, while not exactly essential, comes with the charms of reprised, well-liked characters and a "didn't-see-that-coming" conclusion that makes up for the first hour's sequelitis.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Not just the funniest film in the series, Men In Black 3 has the best story, too.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> An eclectic cast and stellar visual effects coalesce to make Men in Black 3 a quintessential kernel of summer popcorn cinema.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Smith continues to make the goofy plot, wild spectacle, and crazed alien antics look good.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> "Men in Black 3" is a bore.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.66 <###> The most important thing is that Men in Black III is actually fun.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> But Men in Black III proves that it's always fun to save the galaxy with Agents J and K, even when bravely facing down the law of diminishing returns.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A film made by committee that doesn't display the touch of anyone with any remaining actual interest in the characters. In the pipeline for years, the film has been fine-tuned to the point that all of its personality was buffed out in the process.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Even if MiB3 exists simply to gobble up cash and rejuvenate some careers, it's a reasonably engaging bit of disposable entertainment.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> It's bright and cheerful and, in a hokey third act twist, generically sweet.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The Men in Black are back, baby.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It evaporates almost as soon as it reaches your retinas.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.65 <###> It's not bad, but it's not great either.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> If, inevitably, it's not as fresh or inventive as the original, it does that thing of riffing on the old favourites in a way that flatters the audience's familiarity pretty well.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The world hasn't been craving another Men In Black sequel as much as Will Smith's agent.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> If there ever is a "Men in Black IV" -- and at this point, it's hard to imagine one -- let's hope it finds that delicate balance between the yuks and the yucks.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> [E]ven though it manages to escape the been-there-done-that feeling of the second movie, Men in Black 3 still never fully justifies its existence.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Almost good enough to neuralyze your memories of MIB2.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> You stop questioning the sight of hairballs launching scorpion boomerangs or shopkeepers dropping their trousers to reveal they're Teddy Ruxpin's pal, Grubby.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A nice throwback to the original and a fun film in its own right.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Third alien adventure is fun, less memorable than the first.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Ups the ante ever so slightly by incorporating some fireworks and daring to the typical gags, but it's still more often than not no great shakes.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> This spirited three-quel comes close to the exuberance of the first Men in Black and is a distinct improvement over its limp 2002 follow-up.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> MiB 3 isn't a bad movie at all; it's simply a vapid one.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> They probably shouldn't make a fourth Men in Black, but then again, they probably shouldn't have made this one either, and it turned out all right.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This is far from [Smith's] finest hour but, rather like the film itself, he ticks all the right boxes, does more than enough to justify the price of a ticket and delivers more than a few genuine laughs.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Enjoyable enough that you won't need neuralising afterwards.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> If you're looking for cinema verite, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a fun, fizzy sequel in a franchise left for dead 10 years ago, have at it.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> "Men in Black 3" has got the MIB mojo back - well, most of it anyway.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> The fresh blood added to MiB3 makes it such an enjoyable movie. Brolin's evocation of Jones never fails to amuse.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Men in Black 3 is almost good enough to make you care about its existence. And yet not quite.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> If it's not nearly as fresh and clever as the 1997 Men in Black, it restores a bit of luster to the series after the dud sequel of 2002.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Rick Baker's creepy-crawly critters continue to impress, but sadly they're the most original and imaginative thing about Men in Black 3. The humans? Don't make me laugh.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The unexpected spark between Smith and Brolin makes MiB3 primo summer fun.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> You've already got a hidden universe of alien inhabitants below the surface of normality, why throw in time travel as well, especially when The Family Guy does it better?
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It's not quite as fresh as the first one, but it's better than the second.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Sonnenfeld depends on crashing action and hyperventilating camera moves to puff up the slack blimp of a story. Unfortunately, there's one effect that computer-animation technicians can never duplicate: a genuine sense of fun.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Happily, it far exceeds the second effort. And while it doesn't quite match the first, it's still a good time - extraterrestrial warts and all.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's like a cross between Looney Tunes and The Naked Lunch - a hallucinogenic popcorn movie you can safely forget the moment it's over. So bring on Men in Black 13!
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It may sound good as a screenwriter's pitch, but it's not much fun to watch.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The movie's a mixed bag, but a cheery, sunny, nifty-looking one, whose emotional strokes count for more than its predecessors' surly attitude.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Smith tries hard here, but that's part of the problem - beads of sweat are all over this thing.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Smith looks younger than ever, and remains impossible not to like, just as it is impossible not to like ice-cream or the first intimations of summer.
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> This sequel is so lifeless and pointless that it moves beyond "unnecessary" into the realm of "unwanted" and "insulting."
771041419 <###> Men in Black III <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Gone is the spark that made the relationship between the exuberant Smith and buttoned-up Jones so much fun.

771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> It won't do the film any harm at the box office that Helen Mirren twinkles indomitably. She's as good as ever, but really - of all the things you want to see Dame Helen doing indomitably, twinkling isn't among them.
771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It makes a dull movie out of a fascinating piece of history.

771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Clearly, the most significant 'Woman in Gold' here is not the portrait nor Adele Bloch-Bauer herself (portrayed in flashback by Antje Traue) but our lead actress, the indomitable Oscar-winner, Helen Mirren,
771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The film is forgivably simplistic and sentimental but also stirring when it reminds us once again of the countless injustices from the Nazi era that can never be made right or forgotten.

771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Despite a debatable focus and dubious moralizing -money plays a pivotal role in the final outcome - "The Woman in Gold" works, largely because of the odd-couple chemistry between Mirren and Reynolds.

771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Director Simon Curtis is lucky to have Helen Mirren on hand, since she can turn the film's art history speeches into something that sounds like conversation. But the screenplay doesn't do either of them any favors.
771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Mirren is her usual stellar self, but the pleasant surprise here is Ryan Reynolds.

771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Director Simon Curtis milks the predictable drama, thrills and heartache of the Holocaust-era story, but it's a paint-by-numbers triumph, a copy of something we've seen many times before.

771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.64 <###> Mirren, sporting an accent that's about as close to Viennese as an English Dame can likely get, imbues Maria with pluck, high dignity and a vulnerability that's kept hidden beneath exterior reserve.
771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.375 <###> A movie that tells a real-life story yet rings utterly false.
771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Even boasting the pooled charisma of stars Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds, Woman in Gold turns out to be a sputtering, clunky machine.

771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Based on a true story about a fight for justice wrapped in passion, memory and determination, and told using the considerable talents of Helen Mirren, Woman in Gold should be a much better movie.
771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> "Woman in Gold" is dutiful and surprisingly dull, rolling along pre-ordained tracks and the familiar cadences of screenwriter Alexi Kaye Campbell's dialogue and situations.
771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Stirring at times, soggy and overly sentimental at others, the film moves surprisingly slow, even though its action, which takes place over many years of legal maneuvering, has been condensed for narrative expediency.
771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The relationship between Altmann and Schoenberg, sometimes testy but always loving, plays out like two actors acting, rather than two actors inhabiting a real situation.

771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Like most dramas, it seeks to connect with its audience and, providing they are open to the story it's telling, it works both as a reminder of past wrongs and an assurance that justice sometimes triumphs.
771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> It's a touching film that entertains with warmth and humor while teaching us something about history, law and justice with enormous heart, subtlety and compassion, brilliantly acted and skillfully written. Is there anything Helen Mirren cannot do?
771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The engaging but perfunctory Woman in Gold isn't exactly an exercise in subtlety, but this eager-to-please film proves that the formidable Helen Mirren can provide interesting nuances even in a story where few exist.

771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> There's a human-interest story at the bottom of this bombast, but it's hard to see the actual people through the weight of history, horror, and hagiography being piled atop them.
771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> It's all a little tired and condescending - like some screenwriter's self-serving memories of his last trip to see Mom - and having Mirren occasionally exclaim what fun or thrills they're having doesn't make it so.
771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Yes, it's based on a true story, a story that is compelling in its own right. But that doesn't mean the filmmakers get a free pass in presenting it to us.

771406253 <###> Woman in Gold <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> When not returning to the Nazi regime's war crimes, the story becomes a rather legalistic quest for justice. Campbell's cumbersome dialogue often sounds copied from legal documents.

329472315 <###> Trapped Ashes <###> Horror <###> 0.375 <###> Dennis Bartok writes this lackluster anthology of four juvenile horror stories dripping with sexual dread and goofball gore.
329472315 <###> Trapped Ashes <###> Horror <###> 0.2 <###> An enormously disappointing waste of time and talent that even the most forgiving of genre buffs will find almost impossible to sit through without squirming in their seats out of sheer boredom.
329472315 <###> Trapped Ashes <###> Horror <###> 0.5 <###> With its gore-comix sensibility and self-conscious flashes of nudity, Trapped Ashes clunks along, and (to be completely petty) never really overcomes its clunky title.

771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Swinton, her hair white and long and her eyes tired and kind, and Hiddleston, moody and resigned, are wonderful - delivering their lines with the dry sighs of a desert breeze.

771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> In "Only Lovers Left Alive," writer-director Jim Jarmusch turns one of his silliest notions into one of the more affecting movies of his career.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> An ultimately enrapturing love story, set on the border of gentility and decadence...Even before the fangs show in the half-smiles, the movie luxuriates in the charm of good-looking actors doing very little.

771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Despite being a film that features vampires as the central protagonists, Only Lovers Left Alive is less about matters of blood and its acquisition than what it takes for love and romance to survive over centuries.

771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> This movie is 130 minutes of awesome, cool-as-a-bloodsicle eye candy. If you like music, this film has the esoteric expertise of a proper rock historian. In short, Only Lovers Left Alive is damn cool.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Exactly the sort of picture about bloodsuckers you'd expect from Jim Jarmusch. And that's a compliment.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> [Their] deadpan joy is infectious, even when they're contemplating suicide, making them the best additions to the blood-freak hall of fame since The Lost Boys, Grace Jones in Vamp and George Hamilton in Love At First Bite.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> It's quite good, it sticks in the memory, and there's very little out there that I would trade it for. But I don't think it's quite a masterpiece, and I'd hesitate to call it one of my favorites.

771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> His anti-Twilight filters various themes and ideas, but they never threaten to become a cohesive plot or offer resolution.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> [Director Jim] Jarmusch, as ever, has the power to sneak up on you. He's a spellbinder. The same goes for his movie.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Like most of Jarmusch's films, the emphasis is not on action but interaction-especially the verbal kind. And atmosphere.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> "Only Lovers Left Alive" marks an artist's welcome return. And the much-needed rescue of a classic monster from the grubby grip of tween novels.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> This is a movie about the transcendent bond between partners who can communicate without speaking a word, so it's only fitting that the gorgeous cinematography perfectly captures the movie's emotional depths.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> It's so elegant and dreamlike-such a departure from most vampire epics-that you won't be bored. It also has a wicked sense of humor you usually don't find in the genre.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive is at its most powerful, and beautiful, when it's concentrating on how the search for immortality, or life's meaning, is found not in time spent, or accomplishments achieved, but in love shared with someone else.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> In addition to unspooling an adult story of bloodsuckers, Lovers manages something few films have done in years: rendering Detroit scenically romantic.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Legendary hipster filmmaker Jim Jarmusch's wryly funny exercise in genre bending hits so many grace notes it ends up being his most satisfying film in years.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> It only makes sense that the warmest film Jarmusch has ever made is about cold-blooded killers.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive excels mainly as a vampire slice of life, functioning beautifully as both an inventory of Jarmusch's literary, philosophical, and musical interests, and a larger comment on the follies of human existence.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Mixing traditional vampire mythology with the director's distinctively aloof brand of cool, Only Lovers is a handsome, compelling, meditative take on the lives of the eternal undead.

771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> You thought there was nothing new to add to the vampire genre? So, apparently, did Jarmusch, which is why Only Lovers Left Alive luxuriates in a curious end-of-an-era melancholy ...
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Hiddleston and Swinton excel as the very refined bloodsuckers, conveying a sense of world-weariness and disillusionment about the behaviour of the "zombie" humans without ever becoming remotely wearisome themselves.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Whenever Jarmusch lets his soundtrack - and his stars - do the talking, the right notes get struck.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> It's hardly surprising that laconic filmmaker Jim Jarmusch (Broken Flowers) has created such an inventively offbeat vampire movie, helped hugely by the ace casting of Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston as extremely long-term lovers.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> If you have ever taken a moment to wonder what a vampire romance directed by Jim Jarmusch would look like, then Only Lovers Left Alive probably comes pretty close to the film you imagined.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The best reason to see this film is Swinton and Hiddleston's achingly sexy double-act as two old, cold souls in still-hot bodies, steadfastly keeping the spark alive even as the world around them slowly snuffs itself out.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Many people love this new movie, which struck me as etiolated twaddle.

771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Enjoyably Jarmuschian take on the vampire movie, enlivened by a literate, drily witty script, a superb soundtrack and a pair of delightful performances from Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> This isn't about action or horror. Jarmusch is far more interested in the modern lives of characters who have lived through every major artistic revolution of the last several centuries.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.68 <###> While Jarmusch's vision is an original take on the genre, it's also hard to fully engage with his efforts, the pace too stately, the script too self-conscious, and the initially intriguing characters ultimately outstaying their welcome.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> There's something magical and magnetic about this world of mature, know-it-all, ultra-cool vampires that Jarmusch creates and somehow it never seems at all silly.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Hiddleston is brilliant. He pulls off a delicate balancing act, never tipping too far into sulky self-indulgence and Swinton is a reliable anchor with her no-nonsense approach to immortal life.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Haunting and idiosyncratic, Jarmusch's vampire marriage preaches to the converted, but he's in fine voice nonetheless.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Self-indulgent? To a point. But Jarmusch makes seductive work of it: the deep, dusty images, the hypnotic pacing.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Hiddleston and Swinton are lovely to watch, but they need more to chew on than this.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The tenets of the director's style (use of dead time, laconic and comic dialogue, deadpan performances) dovetail to satisfying effect here; Swinton and Hiddleston both give sublime performances ...
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> The problem is that both lead characters are interminably dull, with the camera's gaze repeatedly dwelling on their mundane private moments and imploring us to be intrigued.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> As is so often the case in Jim Jarmusch's films, simply spending time in the company of his creations proves engrossing.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Jim Jarmusch's most lucid, satisfying, and flat-out gorgeous feature since Dead Man.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Made with droll suavity - though sometimes quirkiness is still occasionally an alibi for lack of ideas, comic or otherwise. As with all his films, you have to let it grow on you.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> While some may find the lack of explanation frustrating, for others it will enhance the intriguing nature of the characters and their relationship.

771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.66 <###> The stakes may not be particularly high in Only Lovers Left Alive, but that's part of Jarmusch's point.
771323636 <###> Only Lovers Left Alive <###> Drama <###> 0.92 <###> The next great midnight classic.

12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.875 <###> About the only CGI illusion occurs when the bad guy exhales cigarette smoke through the blowhole of his tracheotomy. But Pinkaew isn't blowing smoke: this is the real deal.

12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> Its plot is pretty much standard-issue. But the action is spectacular enough to allow the audience to overlook that problem.

12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.4 <###> Jaa's moves are impressive, but the choreography ranges from bland to ridiculous (as when one dirty fighter resorts to using major appliances as weapons).
12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> No prizes will be awarded to anyone who guesses that Ting beats all assailants and recovers the artifact.

12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.625 <###> Ong-Bak's only agenda is kicking butt, and it does that pretty well.

12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> A knockout of a martial arts movie -- and an elbow to the head. And two knees to the back and a roundhouse kick to the ear for good measure.
12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> If you combined the genes of Chan and Bruce Lee with a dash of Buster Keaton, the result might resemble Jaa.
12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.5 <###> For every moment that inspires vocal awe, there are two or three moments that produce groans.
12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.7 <###> Jaa is not just a martial arts phenomenon but young, photogenic and charismatic.
12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> You can rightly say that Jaa has yet to establish much of a character, but give him a chance.
12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> I wouldn't bet against a kickboxer who sets himself on fire and then crushes an opponent between his flaming fibulas.
12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> The time to catch Tony Jaa is now.
12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.875 <###> Thai genre filmmakers are still finding their pathway, however awkwardly. What they can boast is a homegrown superstar: Tony Jaa.
12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.75 <###> The movie's strong points are its clever chase sequences, in which Jaa outruns (or levitates over) gangs of murderous baddies through obstacle courses of everyday Bangkok commerce and street traffic.
12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.875 <###> Imaginatively plotted destruction abounds.

12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.625 <###> The opening scene is best, of men combatively climbing a huge tree like crazed monkeys. After that, it's a steady slide down into the sludge pond of global junk cinema.
12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.625 <###> Nearly every impressive stunt is repeated in slow motion from a different camera angle, and we get to see the most eye-popping ones three times. Thus a tightly edited, 90-minute action flick becomes a bloated, 105-minute exercise.
12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.6 <###> The meat of the matter is fight sequences, and rather than being goosed with now-common digital effects and Hong Kong-style wirework, it's all real and all breathtaking.

12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.7 <###> It's nice to see a film set in the modern world that lets its combatants punch each other in the skull.
12874 <###> Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.625 <###> The film's middle stretch is an unmistakable tour de brute force.
771362327 <###> Faith Connections <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> While he does a decent job of bringing us into the trivial daily existence of these different characters during the event, Nalin doesn't quite manage to capture its greater significance.

770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.9 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django is a singular work of art that both celebrates those disjointed parts and synthesizes them into a strangely cohesive %u2013 and more amazingly, unique whole.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> ...everything that was supposed to enliven the picture perfect images just seemed to drag them down with lame dialogue and cliched action.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Miike knows how to film cartoonish violence with style, and the sillier the movie becomes in its mayhem, the harder it is to turn away from.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> As much of a hoot as the movie is, it feels like just an exercise well before it ends.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django is Takashi Miike's frantic swirl of a spaghetti western, marrying eastern and western elements in what could be taken as either homage or parody -- or both.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> The chaotic elements never really coalesce into a sensible whole beyond the idea that this is what, at that moment, Miike thought would be really cool...the film is cluttered and not very fun.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Cult director Takashi Miike's English-language Sukiyaki Western Django has style to burn but self-destructs like a wildfire as it attempts to spoof spaghetti westerns -- a passe endeavor -- and Sergio Corbucci's Django in particular.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> An homage to the concept of "more is less."
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> More action, gun fights and swords fail to make this a better film than the spaghetti westerns that came before. Tarantino is great but his small part is too little to lift this Eastern oater much above average.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.74 <###> It's a perfect execution of its genres and offers enough of a gimmick to maintain interest. Unfortunately, Sukiyaki never rises above its roots and, strangely enough, doesn't actually offer up anything new.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> The lurid sets and savage and startling action will undoubtedly have cult appeal as the conventions of physics, history and genre are all ignored in this overblown fever dream.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Utterly deranged.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> It is, of course, a must for Miike's legions of fans, of which I am one. It also should serve as a way for mainstream audiences to become acquainted with Miike.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> A lightweight goof that feels a little dashed-off, the latest from cult director Takashi Miike won't earn him any new fans, but might entertain the many he's already got.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django is comfort food garnished with aural and ocular delights. It's often quite moving, as well; though not the most nutritious repast, few will describe it as forgettable.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> A loving and lurid pastiche of the spaghetti westerns that were themselves lurid pastiches of classic Hollywood cowboy pictures.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django is Sergio Leone on LSD. It's every '60s/'70s revisionist western riff supersaturated in stylized bombast and a purposed perversion of the motion picture mannerism.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Far and away the finest section is the final showdown, smoothly and swiftly shot with excessive violence and gore.

770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Miike's taste for boldly violent and darkly comic action finds glorious craziness in the splatter of blood and mixture of styles.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> For all the visual originality, Sukiyaki seems framed by quotes, a long string of self-conscious references to other films, notably the 1966 Italian Western Django.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Though Miike is a visually accomplished filmmaker capable of staging simultaneous action on more than one visual plane, his knack for aesthetic inventiveness only surfaces in occasional moments of inspiration.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> While the film felt rushed (or ignored) in certain areas, Miike excels to the top of his game in others (oh, the awesome eye candy!).... If you're looking for a Takashi Miike film, you've found it.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Yes, it's completely bonkers but that's what makes it so great.
770677531 <###> Sukiyaki Western Django <###> Western;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Sem exibir qualquer intencao de ser um bom filme, o longa se resume a uma colecao de excentricidades que ora funcionam como magica e ora caem como verdadeiras bombas sobre a plateia.

771359564 <###> Maggie <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Maggie is a one-dimensional portrayal of a father coming to terms with his daughter's zombie diagnosis, with ineffectual characters and more tears than emotion.
771359564 <###> Maggie <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Arnold Schwarzenegger is remarkably good in this indie-flavored horror-drama, with the emphasis on the latter.
771359564 <###> Maggie <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> "Maggie" is a moving drama. Echoing the moods of hard-hitting films but with the charisma of any entertaining blockbuster you would see this summer.
771359564 <###> Maggie <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> I give the odd, small film Maggie all the points in the world for experimenting with genre-blending and subverting audience expectations, but there's just too much about it that fails to connect.
771359564 <###> Maggie <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.65 <###> In a genre practically defined by fatalism, Maggie probably reigns supreme.
771211053 <###> Pure Country 2: The Gift <###> Drama <###> 0.375 <###> ...a shockingly bottom-of-the-barrel endeavor...
771211053 <###> Pure Country 2: The Gift <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> There are, however, three strokes of genius. Bronson Pinchot, Michael McKean and Cheech Marin as the angels light up the screen. Their celestial banter is a joyful hoot to watch.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> A compelling, nail-biting spy thriller.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Russell Crowe has finally realised he's just an ordinary fat guy now, and taken a role he can accurately portray.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Body of Lies is an extremely well paced, tightly wound, and intensely violent thriller. There is no damnation or congratulations here. As Russell Crowe muses as the end: "No one is innocent"
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> ...[Ridley] Scott's most entertaining and involving effort since 2001's Black Hawk Down.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It doesn't help that those action scenes all blend together, relying overmuch on speeding convoys of big black SUVs and surveillance planes that can see you picking your nose from miles up.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Visually, the film is quite striking. Few modern filmmakers handle desert landscapes as well as Mr. Scott.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A certain rawness and despairing urgency is never quite achieved for the message the film wants to deliver, and so it remains a well-intentioned, well-produced, yet generally unmemorable entertainment.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.65 <###> Passable entertainment -- but definitely not on par with the usual DiCaprio, Crowe, or Ridley Scott output.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.68 <###> For those of us who want movies to be about something and not just empty action with minimal shallow 'moral of the story' tacked on, Body of Lies is a disappointment.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> ...better than a lot of the post 9/11 espionage films that Hollywood has made.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> If you're going to have a mall-ready entertainment about the war on terror, you might as well have this one. [Blu-ray]
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> When Russell Crowe gives a lackluster performance, you know how meager a year it's been at the movies. In Body of Lies, Crowe is bogged down in a thankless role in a thankless movie.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Basicamente un buen film de entretenimiento sobre un tema "serio" como el combate al terrorismo, armado de manera eficaz aunque superficial.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Como diversao, Rede de Mentiras merece aplausos. Isto nao impedira, claro, que ele seja relegado ao esquecimento completo dentro de poucos anos.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Better than the vast majority of the post-9/11 terrorist yarns, Body of Lies is both more ambiguous and ambitious than such heavy-handed duds as Rendition and Redacted.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Perhaps Scott's ever-restless shooting style doesn't quite differentiate between the peaks and troughs of the narrative, yet it's still an engrossing account of the intersection between process and ethics.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Like Syriana without either the balls or the brains, Body Of Lies is perfectly presentable. You just expect better from the likes of Leo, Russ and Ridley.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> But despite the immaculate production values, the satire is so unspeakably crude that it ceases to matter. A shame. Scott has been an instrumental director in the Hollywood evolution of war films. But Body of Lies is a one-note rant.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Body of Lies is big and bombastic, confused and irritable - a 20th-century blockbuster struggling to adapt (too little, too late) to a 21st-century terrain.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Scott, at heart, is a pyrotechnician rather than a political philosopher. Sometimes, during the scenes when he shows graphic acts of torture, he seems like a two-penny shock merchant, too.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> With high-class acts to match the hi-tech savvy of Scott and his trusty crew (cinematographer Alexander Witt, editor Pietro Scalia, composer Mark Streitenfeld), this is as taut and engrossing a couple of hours as you'll experience all year.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Syriana, this ain't. Ridley Scott's latest misses the scope, texture or depth to dig into the moral mess of the war on terror. But this entertaining techno-thriller feeds greedily off star performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Strong.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Body Of Lies lacks the epic sweep of Gladiator and the emotional pull of Thelma And Louise. But it's enormously competent, with a couple of fine supporting performances from Crowe and Strong.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> If the starry but soulless crime flick American Gangster wasn't enough to convince you Ridley Scott was a man past his prime, check out Body Of Lies - a starry but soulless terrorism movie.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> For all the enthralling visuals and action, the film feels garbled.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.2 <###> But it's something of a penance to sit through, a token handwringing over American dirty tricks that's just another opportunity for Scott and co to blow stuff up.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Body of Lies can't quite make up its mind whether to be an all-out thriller or a savvy political drama with something relevant to say about Muslim fundamentalism and the American response to it.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> While this film's themes seem to address issues of terrorism and CIA meddling, and the powerful cast suggests we're in Important Movie territory, the result is essentially just a routine spy thriller: entertaining but forgettable.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Over-directed, frequently dull and ultimately disappointing thriller that wastes the talents of its two leads and strands them with a tedious script that somehow manages to be both confusing and overly simplistic.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Ridley Scott does not reflect on causes, only on operations. Body Of Lies may engage the warrior techno-geeks, but its amorality is uninvolving.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Body of Lies proves as generic as its title.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Perfectly workmanlike, unimpeachably prestige-y, achingly contemporary, and a near-complete failure as revelation
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> A timely game of cat and mouse that benefits from the performances by its two leads.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Body of Lies grants Ferris the usual moral rightness -- even as he's committing questionable acts, he means well.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Ridley Scott delivers an involving if sometimes meandering spy thriller and gets in some choice digs about the paralyzed state of American intelligence in the post-9/11 age.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> 'Body of Lies' is an adults-only story about espionage and the politics of war.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> So much of Body of Lies lumbers along in a lazily predictable manner.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> DiCaprio's solid, though I wonder if a real CIA agent could get away with looking so earnest every second. Crowe has the right idea, in addition to all the fun: Just throw it away, throw it away and pretty soon you build yourself a clever characterization
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> It works better as an action-adventure, thanks to Ridley Scott's knack for tightening the screws on the intensity.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> ... a forgettable spy non-thriller ...
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Exciting enough while it's unfolding, but it lacks an original element and there aren't enough scenes where Crowe and DiCaprio are playing off each other.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> A respectable second-rank thriller -- intelligent but muddled, action-packed but thoughtful.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Body of Lies may not tell us anything we didn't already know about the way the US does business in the Middle East, but it's compelling nonetheless.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Body of Lies is the movie Syriana and The Kingdom wanted to be.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Obnoxiously typical, and only its pointlessly convoluted series of double crosses in the middle even gives it the semblance of drama.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Just because Leonardo DiCaprio gets worked like a speed bag doesn't mean Ridley Scott isn't pulling the punches he usually packs. It's emotionless chaos that's more like "Collateral Damage," less a film weighing what collateral damage really means.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Tarred with the brush of the war movie curse
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It looks really good and has really great acting in it, [but it] doesn't amount to much in the end, emotionally.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The fact that Roger could have turned to Ed and said, 'I got to go see about a girl,' comes close to negating the impact this film should have.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Hugely disappointing film, even moreso when considering the talent involved.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> Body of Lies delivers excellent performances along with realistic action, suspense and drama.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> It's official: the Ridley Scott who created such signature visions as Blade Runner and Alien is dead and has been replaced by a pod person that churns out slick-looking, but wholly generic big-budget time-wasters.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Despite a too-long running time, a silly Hollywood ending, and an unconvincing love interest, this is a well-made, high energy, fast-paced film loaded with tension.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Gets across a palpable sense of Iraq fatigue. Which is another way of saying it invites the audience to see the talking-Chihuahua picture instead.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Body of Lies could've been one of those gag trailers at the beginning of Tropic Thunder.

770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Bloated and far-fetched, it's filled with two-and-half-hours of meandering meaninglessness.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> It's an exciting movie, done in the flashy, breath-catching hyper-visual mode we expect from Scott. But in the end, it gets bogged down ...
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Doesn't tell its story clearly, and buries its most compelling aspects beneath action scenes and romantic subplots that detract from them.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> A palpable tension grinds on you for a bit over two-hours and leaves you as drained as the film's characters.

770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The plot occasionally becomes convoluted and murky, but when it trains its focus on matters of treachery and intrigue, Body of Lies is exciting and compelling.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> The result isn't a lecture about American foreign policy, but a smartly updated old-fashioned espionage thriller.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Body of Lies is more than anything a missed opportunity -- or perhaps, given its cellular phoniness, a series of missed connections.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The world of Body of Lies should feel chaotic and dangerous. But Scott's camera, smoothly gliding across one stately image after another, keeps assuring us everything is fine.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> DiCaprio bleeds and curses and emotes all over the desert, but the movie he inhabits seems cold, like a clockwork mechanism...
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> This makes for a movie experience in which the viewer sits patiently for about 45 minutes waiting for the story to kick in, only to realize, oh. So this is it.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Like Blade Runner, the film reminds us of the corrupting nature of power, and how those who look down on others often fail to understand the consequences of their actions.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Though Body of Lies hews a bit too closely to convention, it still engages throughout thanks to DiCaprio and director Scott.

770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> "Body of Lies" is an intelligent geopolitical thriller that ... is really about the manipulation of people like chess pieces on a worldwide board.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Body of Lies is a riddle wrapped in an enigma served with a side of mystery meat. It's very watchable, with some entertaining action beats, kind of a Syriania as scripted by Tom Clancy, a The Kingdom with a little less C.S.I.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> It's a little bit of Syriana, a lot of Traitor -- and an awful lot of scenes of people cursing into cell phones.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Body of Lies is being hailed in some quarters as a 'new' kind of war thriller. While this glitzy production may attract audiences suffering from battle fatigue, it's nothing of the sort.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Art may be imitating life, but it sure makes for dull movies. Body of Lies is the latest example of what a crutch this has become -- show grainy satellite images, cut to a chase in a crowded bazaar, discuss 'intel'. Repeat.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Unfortunately, we've seen variations on this story a dozen times.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> An apocalyptic vision of cloak-and-dagger intelligence, Lies is like a suicide note written by Tom Clancy, but the movie's gloomy inaccessibility actually makes it all the more intriguing.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Body of Lies has its share of exciting moments -- Scott remains a master at directing physical action -- and it certainly couldn't be more timely. But it's also a safe and predictable movie about a subject that is neither.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> As the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> A well-crafted but curiously generic spy thriller that, for its final hour at least, comes off as formulaic as its title.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Even if Body of Lies lacks a huge emotional wallop, it dishes plenty of food for thought.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Given the giga-talent involved -- virtuoso visualist Scott, The Departed's William Monahan adapting Washington Post columnist David Ignatius's novel -- I was hoping for something more substantive than Syriana-meets-Spy Game.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> On this basic premise builds a complicated story plied with onion layers of perspective and cunning.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> High production value and solid performances lay enough of a spit shine on an otherwise dingy pile of drivel.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> [Ridley Scott] has few peers at keeping a complex script clear and tightly focused...
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> The movie is an urgent current-events thriller that falls somewhere between Syriana and the Bourne movies.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> DiCaprio helps turn what could have been a dry-as-sand Middle Eastern thriller into a compelling suspense film that questions the ethics of espionage and counterterrorism without turning sanctimonious or screedlike.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> DiCaprio and Crowe, who both deliver excellent performances, may nevertheless be overshadowed by the outstanding turn by British actor Strong.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Both complicated and compelling, Body of Lies offers an audacious glimpse at the hypocrisy and religious furor fueling a struggle most Americans recognize only as a political catch phrase -- a 'war on terror.'
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.55 <###> Crowe's a delight as a crafty Deputy Dawg from Arkansas; Mark Strong's Hani has an IQ to match his GQ. Surprisingly, the only undernourished part belongs to DiCaprio.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Body of Lies is smart, sophisticated and hopelessly uninvolving.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Yet in spite of the movie's high-tech veneer and its top-billed stars, Body of Lies is depressingly inert.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> By the end, Body Of Lies is revealed as just another big-budget movie designed to cash in on the real-enough Middle East conflicts. It's a gangster movie without cops and criminals.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Some show is made of plunging the viewer into a dense cloud of moral ambiguity, but this is mostly smoke and mirrors: while the American heroes may employ some dubious tactics, the justice of their cause is never in doubt.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The complex plot is rendered with clarity and precision, the action scenes are very well staged, the suspense is palpable, and the performances are first-rate.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.25 <###> I'm not much of a mathematician, but you can say this one is Crowe Scott DiCaprio = Disappointment
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.9 <###> It's a film directed by one of the best directors in Hollywood, written by one of the best writers and has two of the best actors around. How could you go wrong?
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Like the intelligence officers it portrays, Body of Lies uses double-crosses and slight of hand to conceal a fairly formulaic story and a climax as offensively conventional as it gets.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> A cut above some of the other recent spate of Middle East-set thrillers.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Mr. Scott's professionalism is, as ever, present in every frame and scene, but this time it seems singularly untethered from anything like zeal, conviction or even curiosity.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> What begins as a movie suggesting the moral complexity of counterterrorism ends up feeling very much like a thriller as generic as its title.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Anyone who actually sees Body of Lies will have a hard time taking it as seriously as audiences took Scott's Black Hawk Down.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Anchored by an amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio and little else, Body of Lies limps along for over two hours, never amounting to more than a decent, if derivative nailbiter.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> After Ridley's less-than-stellar stretch including Matchstick Men, Kingdom of Heaven, A Good Year and American Gangster, expectations are medium at best and Body of Lies does nothing to raise them.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The film lacks the urgency and, ironically, the intelligence required for something along these lines to succeed.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.85 <###> As disturbing as it is compelling, Ridley Scott has outdone himself with his first modern-day political thriller, delivering his strongest movie since Black Hawk Down.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A bewildering mishmash of double-crosses, cover-ups, and cliches, Monahan's treatment unfortunately undermines some terrific performances and a solid outing for director Ridley Scott.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Body of Lies is most alive while relishing the surveillance and communications tools abused by Hoffman, tools that supply him military intelligence, but not the smarts or scruples to effectively use it.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Oscar voters leery of voting for (gasp!) comic book movie, 'The Dark Knight,' for multiple accolades come award season finally have another option with the release of 'Body of Lies.'
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Body of Lies nearly goes too far. As it is, this heavily political thriller becomes too serious and much too dark at times, and it doesn't seem to be serious enough when it really counts.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> So many like-minded films have beat it to the punch that there's nothing new to offer audiences. The talents of all involved have been wasted, and so has our time.

770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> 'Body of Lies' is a tense, deftly paced meditation on America's role in the Middle East, and if it's not quite a war movie, it offers somber insights into the Bush administration's campaign against terror that recent thrillers like 'The Kingdom' have not.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Body of Lies isn't half bad, sprinkling in well-shot action and some moments of genuine suspense.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> While action-adventure conventions take precedence over socio-political analysis, visceral kicks are in short supply, a situation that throws the film's tendencies toward stale misdirection and goofy melodrama into sharp relief.
770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> The plot devolves into a potboiler, reduced to a series of sequences wherein DiCaprio and Crowe can posture with the requisite machismo

770681151 <###> Body of Lies <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> What distinguishes the book with gripping realism may not be so apparent in the cinematic context. Still, for spy calculus, action, and character realization, I assign you to see it.

770681152 <###> Shutter Island <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Shutter Island is too long and its increasingly surreal tone provides an ending that's a bit of a cheat. But, since it is a Scorsese picture, there's a lot to intrigue on the way.
770681152 <###> Shutter Island <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Since Scorsese is a stylist, the film is enjoyable. It would be more so if you could take out your brain and experience it only with eyes and ears.

771364241 <###> Sleeping with Other People <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A much more conventional picture than Headland's debut: Sweeter, messier and far more determined to charm than to provoke.
771364241 <###> Sleeping with Other People <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It probably adheres a little too closely to a romantic-comedy formula - it hits a perfect, bittersweet ending, and then plows right on through it for another 15 minutes to the ending we all know is coming.
771364241 <###> Sleeping with Other People <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Brie is always a delight, but SLEEPING WITH OTHER PEOPLE is a fairly bland rom-com that too often brings to mind the superior WHEN HARRY MET SALLY.

13659 <###> The Blues Brothers <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The film retains a huge nostalgic kick, thanks in large part to Aykroyd and Belushi's easy rapport, a smattering of daft, shaggy humour and some truly iconic musical sequences.

13659 <###> The Blues Brothers <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> This essentially modest movie is reported to have cost about $30 million, and what did all that money buy? Scores of car crashes. Too many extras. Overstaged dance numbers. And a hollowness that certainly didn't come cheap.
13659 <###> The Blues Brothers <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Big, loud, often obnoxious, but surprisingly sweet-tempered.
13659 <###> The Blues Brothers <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> It's many excesses just make this brilliant slapstick musical even more enjoyable.
13659 <###> The Blues Brothers <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. A classic in all sense of the word.
13659 <###> The Blues Brothers <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Bloated, overlong, too many car crashes, too little humor. A big disappointment.
13659 <###> The Blues Brothers <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> There's not one ineffective cameo in a movie with many because there's no sense of stunt casting or camera hogging.
13659 <###> The Blues Brothers <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The story is thin, but there's a consistently wonderful over-the-top mentality.

11246 <###> Godzilla Vs Mechagodzilla II (Gojira VS Mekagojira) <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> With so little connective tissue of note, the monster scenes feel airless and aimless, existing solely as generic spectacle without context or weight.
19742 <###> A Hole in the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Classics;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Weak Capra light drama does have Sinatra and Edward G.
19742 <###> A Hole in the Head <###> Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Classics;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Overlong, reactionary, but enjoyable with enough of the old Capra magic to make it work.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction is as close to an incoherent mess of movement & noise as cinema gets. Michael Bay is slowly perfecting his brand of blockbuster, and to be honest it's getting quite compelling to watch him fall down this rabbit hole
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> If in doubt, smash everything to pieces - and be as noisy as possible.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction is simply more of the same mindless action, flat characters, and utter boredom that we've come to expect from these bloated mechanical sequels.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Transformers have souls, this movie repeatedly tells us, but does Michael Bay?
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> I'm not going to say that Transformers: Age of Extinction is quite "good." But it is arguably the least "bad" of the franchise.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.125 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction isn't so much a movie as it is a 165-minute propaganda film made to appeal to the widest demographic possible - but mainly for China.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> The Transformers series returns with what just might be the worst entry yet...
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> It's worse than any of the previous three movies in the franchise and the worst, so far, of this year's parade of would-be 'blockbusters.'
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> It is frankly pointless to knock its quintessentially Bay aesthetic of massive mayhem and the equally shameless broad corniness of its humor, for all of that is clearly what the film was meant to be and dutifully delivers.

771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> With each film in the Transformer saga, Michael Bay makes it clear that all he's interested in are massive metallic special effects bashing into each other and usually exploding.

771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> It has the pace of an oscillating house fan, going back and forth between boring exposition and bursts of action in which you suddenly have no idea WTF is going on.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Sweet, swollen with box-office self-importance, and probably just what the kids want for midsummer dessert.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> There remains something undeniably exciting about seeing Optimus Prime kicking ass or witnessing the superbly-detailed Dinobots.

771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Let's just view the latest edition, Transformers: Age of Extinction, on a relative scale: This is probably the best film so far in the series.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.32 <###> At this point, recounting any more of the film's numerous faults would be akin to copying-and-pasting criticisms of the previous three films.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Stupid it may be but it's a lot better than the last two episodes. The plot is easier to follow, the special effects are even more spectacular and, for once, the movie has an acceptable leading man.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.0 <###> AT the centre of our galaxy is a supermassive black hole. Not even light can escape from its powerful gravitational pull. And not even that sucks as much as this movie.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> A movie so mind blowing and awesome, I forgot my own name while watching it.

771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Preferable to syphilis.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> As a visual showcase, Bay's blockbuster delivers. Though the question remains, is that really enough?
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Horrifically garish but undeniably fascinating ...
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Age Of Extinction transforms into a typically bombastic Bay offering. If it's major-league spectacle you want, though, look no further.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> There's no good reason to justify how a film that's essentially about robots bashing other robots can be stretched out to such gargantuan lengths, especially with a plot as hole-ridden and lightweight as this.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The urine you discharge during the inevitable p*ss-break is guaranteed to flow better than any dialogue in this near three-hour movie.

771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Michael Bay's latest exercise in excess is the biggest, longest, loudest, explodiest film ever made.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Long before Optimus Prime hoists his hulking metal frame onto the back of a giant robot dinosaur, wields his mighty sword and rides valiantly away to save the planet once more, Transformers: Age of Extinction plays like a parody ...
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The ploy Bay has used, unsuccessfully, is that as the story becomes more and more stupid, and the stupidity is jaw-dropping in its scope, the effects become bigger and bigger
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Why are we here? What is the purpose of life on earth? And why are alien robots so hellbent on impersonating our automobiles?
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Based on approximately 615 minutes worth of evidence, the series probably won't get much better than Age of Extinction, which is less a recommendation than a statement of resignation.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Abysmal! Unless you're really into techie toys, it's excruciating to watch - a tortuous endurance test.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Unabashed junk, but when historians dig it up it in hundreds of years, they'll find much of value.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.65 <###> The sequel to Transformers I've been waiting three movies for.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> With all of the exploding Porsches and Lamborghinis that its $180 million dollar budget affords, Extinction feels like the cinematic equivalent of big game hunting (especially when it is set in a country where the minimum wage is $2 an hour).
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> You'll get the beer commercial filmmaking you've grown to know... I may end up hating it in retrospect, but I can't deny its mainstream fast food entertainment value.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Age of Extinction won't win over Transformers movie skeptics but Michael Bay succeeds in giving his fans what they are looking for - unmatched CGI spectacle.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> Even by the low IQ standards of the three previous Transformers films, Transformers: Age of Extinction is grave and exceptionally stupid, with a plot as bewildering and incoherent as a caffeinated 5-year-old's explanation of the multiverse theory.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> There are some fun action moments scattered throughout, although they're largely negated by a screenplay that somehow manages to be overstuffed yet still thin.

771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.125 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction, despite the hopeful ring of finality in the title, is merely another chapter in the saga, and far and away the worst one so far.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Waaayyyy too long but not as bad as some are painting it to be. If this is your thing, what I, or other critics think, won't matter anyway.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> [Compared to Michael Bay's earlier work in Bad Boys and Armageddon], the Transformers films resemble out-of-control art school projects - crass without being remotely watchable, as if mocking the very notion of entertainment.

771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The worst part is, with a semi-capable script and a more focused delivery, Michael Bay could have had a pretty stellar Transformers movie, instead of yet another Bay-splosion filled bit of clunky chaos.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.1 <###> Congratulations, Denise Richards; you're no longer the most laughable movie scientist of all time.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> It's just noise, color and movement. It's like a "Baby Einstein" video for teens, but infinitely louder and dumber. And so very, very long.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.1 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction oversimplifies and stupefies what was already a dumbed down formula for a successful summer action blockbuster.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.0 <###> Action can be exciting. But chaos gets boring fast.

771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The film is somehow both over-plotted and yet completely lacking in story and the action just too disjointed to work. I still want a sequel, and that's because Optimus Prime riding on a Dinobot is really freaking awesome.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.45 <###> It is eye-rolling, but Wahlberg and Tucci keep things fun and lively. Don't expect to be moved dramatically in any significant way, however. The relationships and dialogue are written poorly and only act to weakly stitch action set-pieces together.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Well before it finished I was numb from its bludgeoning excess.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.1 <###> The first twenty minutes are great with Wahlberg stealing the show as a wannabe inventor but when the Transformers arrive onscreen, it all goes downhill.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> This is as excruciating a movie as is likely to be experienced by anyone, anywhere.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> The Transformers are brilliant, brave, world-conquering space travelers. Time to morph into something entertaining.

771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Transformers: Age Of Extinction will remind you of every reason why you love and hate Michael Bay.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Little more than a licensing expo masquerading as a Hollywood blockbuster.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> "Transformers: Age of Extinction" isn't a "good" movie by any conventional standards, but as nothing more than empty, stupid, sometimes dazzling spectacle it provides exactly what audiences who flock to this series will be looking for.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> ...all the noise and fights among machines for almost three hours is just too much for any normal human to endure. Cut 90 minutes and you have a pretty good movie.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Turns out Transformers: Age of Extinction actually lives up to its title and chronicles not just the death of our bond with the Autobots, but the death of cinema, and that once-fearsome T. rex called American culture.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> The film sags conspicuously under the weight of its accrued event-movie baggage.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.45 <###> With his fourth bite at the Transformers apple, director Michael Bay escapes from the dungeon of the actively insulting and scales the giddy heights of the mildly obnoxious.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> It is one of the most relentless movies I have ever seen. It just refuses to end.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> This franchise has become a case of judging bad apples, and Transformers: Age of Extinction is the least rotten of the bunch.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> The final confrontation alone lasts close to an hour, and at some point, you may find yourself simply in a daze, unable to absorb any further action into your brain.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> In an homage to such "cinema of cruelty" classics as Andy Warhol's real-time "Sleep," Bay allows the film to run for almost three hours and abandons all pretense of a plot.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> There's only one thing anyone really needs to know about [this] exercise in robot-on-robot violence: at nearly three hours, it's the longest "Transformers" yet. Any mention of the leaden dialogue [and] wooden acting...would just be piling on.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> Say what you will about these movies, but in audio terms they're things of beauty.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> One thing you have to give Bay credit for: He has a knack for bringing A-list talent down to his level.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.125 <###> It's long, it's loud and it's really stupid.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> There are so many action sequences related to so many story lines, that midway through an epic fight, you might find yourself wondering what exactly started this particular battle and what the objective is other than destruction for the sake of it.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> Like a nuclear arsenal launched by an insane despot, Michael Bay's "Transformers: Age of Extinction" aims for a million different targets and incinerates them beyond recognition.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Except for Tucci, the humans possess less personality than the robots as they race from one ridiculously mounted action sequence to another.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> a mind-numbing experience, disorienting in its randomness and ridiculous in its brute force bombast
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.0 <###> Michael Bay has done the impossible. With Transformers: Age of Extinction, the start of a - everyone duck! - second trilogy in his metalhead franchise, the Bay-man has made the worst and most worthless Transformers movie yet.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.1 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction isn't a bad movie; it's the worst possible product of a big Hollywood system drunk on a cocktail of fermented nostalgia and rancid profiteering while driving moviegoing into the ground.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> Michael Bay outdoes himself here, creating the biggest, bloatiest, Michael Bay-est film ever. There is scarcely a moment in its 165 minutes that does not involve frenzied screaming, smashing or shooting.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> If you like ear-piercing explosions and bizarre spaceships and wooden dialogue that serves simply to get from one action scene to another, "Transformers: Age of Extinction" delivers on all fronts.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Bay is used to delivering entertainment by the megatonne, and his latest epic continually tops everything he did in the previous three films.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.61 <###> There are few pleasures in life like having your seat vibrate with the deep, resonant tones of Peter Cullen's Optimus Prime.

771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Parts of 'Transformers: Age of Extinction' are watchable, even thrilling. But [Michael Bay's] supposed to be offensive, wretched, vulgar.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> All that's left to blow up is Bay's contract, passing the reins to someone who realizes that noise and boredom aren't mutually exclusive.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> Imagine if instead of creating new music, a recording artist kept putting out the exact same album, just playing the songs a little louder each time. That's what it feels like watching "Transformers: Age of Extinction."
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> It is scattered, weightless, impossible to get hold of, and somehow, after seven years and more than 10 hours of screen time, I could not tell you what these films are about.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> To say that Age of Extinction is the best installment in the money-minting Transformers franchise is like saying the best episode of The Love Boat was the one that had Charo in it: The praise is so faint, it's close to meaningless.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Hello, police? I'd like to report an assault.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> ...a bloated, incoherent mess that may divert children (and grown-ups who enjoyed playing with the toys) who have turned the last three films into international hits.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Give Age Of Extinction this much credit: Of all the Transformers movies, this is the longest.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Confounding. But not without its thrills.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> One-hundred-and-sixty-five minutes. Think about that.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> If the "human scenes" all reek of adolescent dialogue and dopey snark masquerading as character development, it's a toss-up if that's better or worse than seeing clattering collections of caliginous junk ...
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Loud, ridiculous and nonsensical - even for a Transformers movie ...
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> You will feel dumber for having sat through it.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> It may be loud and stupid, but at least it's loud and stupid.

771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> An overly familiar collage of bombastic bewilderment.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> The race to the title of Worst Transformers Movie has a new contender.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.63 <###> Lovers of all things explosions, visual effects marvels, and Autobots will be granted a wealth of all of the above, plus a few intriguing and unexpected twists. At a certain point it may start to feel like too much of a good thing, though.
771269858 <###> Transformers: Age of Extinction <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Imagine a little boy, playing with his Transformers in front of a mural that he's created from clippings of his favourite films. Now give that boy a couple of hundred million dollars; voila.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> The film is driven more by its concept than by its plot but it's still a fun summer film.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Expensive, a misfire, but perfectly servicable for what it is
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Delivers on the promise of an exciting genre mash-up but, even with a talented cast and revered team of writers, fails to weave a fulfilling story.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Patchy, if enjoyable in parts, but nowhere near as awesome as that title suggests it should be.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Jon Favreau's "Cowboys & Aliens" is a film that starts off with promise, but quickly loses its way as it tries to merge two different genres.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Rather refreshingly what-you-see-is-exactly-what-you-get: a western with aliens grafted on, or a sci-fi invasion film with cowboys grafted on--nothing more, nothing less.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> A mercilessly boring, wasted opportunity that forgets to have a sense of humor, charisma, or aliens.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> While we were hoping and rightly expecting some old school magic from the director of Iron Man, the director of Iron Man 2 showed up.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> 'Reach for the skies' has a whole new meaning now. The science-fiction Western 'Cowboys & Aliens' is an entertaining, genre-blending romp. It's a serious movie, too - a drama with comedic moments - and that makes it all the more exciting.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Not the Boys Own Adventure it could have been, but a fun - if often flawed - romp.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> No amount of gee-whiz techno-wizardry or nifty pop-cultural juxtapositions can save Cowboys & Aliens from two terrible truths: it has a dud script, and a dud director.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> full review at Movies for the Masses
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> we get a standard story, some decent setpieces and only a few funny lines...Take the ride, but don't blame us if you end up saddle sore.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Uma diversao eficiente que, sim, poderia ter explorado sua otima premissa com mais cuidado, mas que ao menos nao a desperdicou com "homenagens" tolas e auto referenciais.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The two marquee stars don't interact much, the "big" action pieces are fairly ho-hum, and the movie just cowpokes along when it seems like it should be having a lot more galloping fun.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> I don't think too many people are going to wander into the theater expecting The Tree of Life. The film delivers exactly what it promises.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> So in much the same way that 'Transformers' is essentially a robot war with a few humans stumbling around trying to get laid; this film should really have been called 'Alien Bracelet Vs. Aliens... With Some Cowboys Falling Off Their Horses'.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The cowboys: great. The aliens: not so much. There's fun to be had here, but it falls way short of the pulp classic it could have been.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> A film where the occasional sense of fun is far outweighed by the omnipresent sense of stupid.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> Overall, a dull, overblown and forgettable farrago.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> There is nothing that fascinating about Favreau's treatment, nor his source material, but compared with similar blockbuster fare of recent months, this curious exercise in genre bending is very watchable.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> There's no doubt seeing a cowboy leap from a horse on to a spaceship is all kinds of awesome.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> I wanted to more than love Cowboys & Aliens. For two hours I wanted to feel 17 again.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The men's relationship is dull and under-explored and the plot is slow, unexciting and silly. Craig is a lot more fun in a tuxedo than a stetson.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> If you can swallow the shameless set-up, it's all highly entertaining.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Jon Favreau handles the big setpieces with competence if no great flair; whenever the plot backs itself into a corner something else will make a sudden, inexplicable interruption.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> A wild and spaced-out horse opera.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> This is definitely a film of two halves - the first is a fantastic western-mystery, the second is a lazy and silly sci-fi.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Why has there never been a film about cowboys beating up extra-terrestrials? This movie will give you a pretty good idea.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Favreau ... allows the material's imaginative possibilities to flare up and fade away.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.0 <###> The density of inanity at the conceptual core of this crass sci-fi western starring Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford pushes outwards, inflating fatuous substance and propelling bric-a-brac in all directions.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> The premise does pretty much what it says on the tin.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> For all its A-list ingredients of concept, cast and director, the resulting mash-up is merely a superior B-movie, as uncertain a fusion as potato on a pizza.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Yes, yes, cowboys punching aliens in the face can be funny. But it doesn't make this silly endeavour worthwhile.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The plot has so many holes and unexplained phenomena that it's hard to know where to begin.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Craig is a bona fide action star who shouldn't be reduced to spitting out lines like "Demons took your gold" in a husky Southern drawl.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Jon Favreau made a really good comic book adaptation out of the original Iron Man but like every director he's dependant on a good screenplay and this one relies on cliches and having taken on this mix of genres it actually isn't wild enough conceptually.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Unfortunately, Cowboys and Aliens takes itself way too seriously to really ignite.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> What started as 'True Grit'-meets-'War of the Worlds' ends up closer to - whisper it - 'Wild Wild West'.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Enjoyable, well made and superbly acted sci fi-slash-Western adventure that duly delivers both cowboys and aliens, though a little bit of humour wouldn't have gone amiss.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> It wasn't unreasonable to expect Favreau ... would at least provide something that felt fresh. Cowboys and Aliens does not feel fresh. But, it does feature cowboys fighting aliens, and sometimes that's all you really need.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> A simple entertainment in a summer of overcomplicated disappointments. Also much harder-edged than you may have expected.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> It's not without its moments but all the imagination seems to have been expended on the title.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> An entertaining Western that sticks very close to the genre and only incidentally features bad guys from another planet.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Favreau's solid adaptation of a popular 2006 graphic novel remains true to both genres while being confidently grounded in western lore for maximum novelty value.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> There is a lot of fun to be had in this sci-fi/western mash-up that plays out as one of the most superbly crafted B-movies you're going to find this side of Tarantino.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Cowboys out duel aliens in clever mash-up.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Enjoyable, but less fun than such low-stakes predecessors as 'The Phantom Empire' with Gene Autry and 'Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter.'
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Feels like a flick that was poked, tweaked, reformatted and re-edited at least a dozen times.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Everything in this movie is borrowed from other movies.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.05 <###> As its title indicates, this is a strange cross of movie genres, and lest any viewers get antsy, it doesn't allow much time to pass before we first encounter UFOs in the Old West. The film takes its time unraveling the rest of the story...
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Cowboys and Aliens isn't the self-aware, campy romp I was expecting...This movie plays its ludicrous idea dead straight and pulls it off with firm conviction.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> It's a good time at the movies -- something all these summer releases aim for, but very often don't achieve.

770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> It's got explosions and horse-riding and fighting and monsters aplenty, but it evaporates almost as you're watching it.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> All the cliches of cowboy films and alien films are there. But I wasn't expecting them not to be. It's a fun western, and throwing in some alien goo makes it all the more fun.

770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Part of the fun in Cowboys & Aliens is spotting all the movie cliches which can be enjoyed for what they are because the film has no relation to any reality other than that of the cinema.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> After a mindless conclusion, I realized that two hours had been wasted on this convoluted mess.

770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford make a terrific, no-nonsense tandem, but there is a certain absurdity to the whole affair that makes the picture seem a bit small in scope.

770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.05 <###> Director Jon Favreau earns his Western bona fides with a sharp eye for casting and locations.

770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Favreau does enough things right to churn out a mostly enjoyable bit of mindless summertime action, just not enough to come close to rivaling his 2008 crowd-pleaser Iron Man.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Solid bordering on stolid. It's Favreau in control again after Avengers advert Iron Man 2 - but given the possibilities, a mild, mild west. More horsing around and another set-piece or two might've helped.

770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> The flaw in Cowboys & Aliens is no sense of humor. What could be more fun than cowboys and aliens? Flaw aside, this is Saturday afternoon matinee fun.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> It's a Western that doesn't feel like a Western, a science fiction film without the allure of science fiction and an action movie without good action. It's disappointing.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Strong performances by the actors helped me buy into this idea hook, line and sinker - it's crazy fun.

770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> It's a fairly decent time-waster, and you could do a lot worse this summer, but I wish that it had conjured up a sense of fun, or a sense of the ridiculous. It should have had a scrappy "B" movie spirit, instead of a lethargic "A" movie spirit.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Over on the aliens side, it's hard to make out faces, but there's no doubt about their place of origin: These slimy, growling, bug-eyed and distinctly non-scary things are straight from central casting.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> If you were curious about this movie because you thought there might be more to it than the obvious, don't overthink it -- the title truly is all you're going to get.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> It squanders its admittedly appealing premise in such a way so that viewers coming out of it feeling even more bummed out because it should have and could have been so much better.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Nothing very exciting happens.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> The action is involving, the characters have a bit more heft than your average gang of desperadoes and the creature design - part "Alien," part hunchback of Notre Dame, part Barbra Streisand (scary talons) - is ingenious.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> It may be two treats in one, but for an audience that's pigged out on spectacle all summer, that might be two treats too many.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> The movie gets by on the strength of agreeable talent who enjoy playing along and can endure the horse manure and space goo being shovelled.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> This sharp-looking, committee-written adaptation of a genre-splicing graphic novel wins points by frequently, smartly and affectionately tipping its hat to classic Westerns and their archetypes.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The idea of mixing cowboy movie imagery with Sci-Fi concepts is a welcome original idea. It's just not executed to the awesome levels that are possible.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Underwhelming and disappointing. With five screenwriters, the film lacked substance and connection to the characters which made the decent action scenes appear worthless.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> ...maybe Jon Favreau would have been better off making a true modern Western, not this shiny bauble of a mashup.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> It has cowboys, and, indeed, it has aliens. Unfortunately, that's about all it seems the movie's five screenwriters ... thought it needed.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> In fact, with this performance and his recurring role as James Bond, Craig may be the baddest man on the planet. To paraphrase a popular joke, Daniel Craig is so bad that Chuck Norris has his poster on his wall.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Might not be the rousing sci-fi action movie some might expect, but there's more than enough fun summer entertainment to make it worthwhile, especially if you're a fan of Westerns.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> One wonders if there is a darker, grittier script for Cowboys & Aliens on Jon Favreau's night stand, dog-eared and tear-stained over what might have been.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> As meticulous and deliberate as the narrative is early on, it is just as clumsy and ineffectual in the second half.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> It's hard to say what is most depressing about "Cowboys & Aliens" - the film itself, or the fact that this was the best movie a posse of major Hollywood players could come up with.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Favreau delivers on the promise of Cowboys & Aliens by delivering cowboys and aliens, but for the first time in his 10-year directing career, there isn't a lot waiting for us beyond the filmmaker's basic plot summary
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> A crowd-pleasing summer movie with more wit than most.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.45 <###> Favreau's film doesn't take any risks, reducing the stakes to the point where the movie descends quickly from its fun exposition to a collection of meaningless explosions and predictable action sequences.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> There is enough to like and to savor in Cowboys & Aliens that it makes for an enjoyable two hours in the dark with a big bag of buttery popcorn.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Director Jon Favreau's competent adaptation of the Hollywood-ready graphic novel delivers on every ounce of its one-joke premise: you'll see cowboys fighting aliens. You'll get very little else.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Cowboys & Aliens is terribly generic -- and mostly joyless, too.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Action-packed yet curiously lifeless, "Cowboys & Aliens" shoots blanks.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.57 <###> Director Jon Favreau certainly puts up a valiant effort to make it all gel but he's working with material from six credited writers. The Frankenstein-ish Cowboys & Aliens feels like it has been pieced together from spare bits.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> The Searchers meet Independence Day. Great fun.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> 'Cowboys & Aliens' is a bland, faceless, callow, moronic, poorly assembled action movie that felt more like playing with plastic cowboys and Indians than shooting an actual gun.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> As far as summer popcorn flicks go, Cowboys & Aliens offers a welcome jolt of originality in a season marked by sequels and brand names. It's just too bad it never quite realizes its full potential.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> "Cowboys & Aliens" (loosely based on a 2006 graphic novel of the same name) provides a slick cinematic vehicle for two of the toughest actors of their generations.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Tonally, the movie is off: not quite as sober and majestic as the John Ford westerns it's inspired by, nor as ironic and irreverent as, well, Favreau's two Iron Man films.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> [Favreau] wavers uncertainly between goofy pastiche and seriousness in a movie that wastes its title and misses the opportunity to play with, you know, ideas about the western and science-fiction horror.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> A rousing action drama that mixes film genres and comes up with a winner propelled by strong performances by Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> It has eight separate screenwriting credits split among six different people, who between them create one halfway decent joke. Brutal math, that.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Alien-invasion aficionados should be pleased. Western nostalgists may be pleasantly surprised. Fans of cowboys-versus-aliens movies, well, it's been a long wait and here's your movie.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> This cross between "True Grit" and "Super 8" is a victim of special-effects fatigue, and an example of how ideas can go wrong when good filmmakers do nothing.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> While I'd love to see Favreau tackle a straight-up western, minus the aliens, COWBOYS & ALIENS is still a fun-filled summer blockbuster. Craig and Ford are great.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.125 <###> If there were a Hippocratic oath for movies, and there should be, it would be "first, do not suck."

770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Cowboys & Aliens is a mashup of a mediocre Western and a mediocre science fiction story. The resulting film is far better than the sum of its two seemingly disparate parts.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The mash-up of cowboys and aliens doesn't do either camp any favors. How are we supposed to work up a rooting interest when both sides are shooting blanks?
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Aside from the idea of mixing two well-loved genres, there is not a single original thought.

770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Cowboys & Aliens is a collision of genres that leaves a mess, but what a mess!

770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> The B-movie marquee title of Cowboys and Aliens suggests a picture that's more irreverent, imaginative, and fun than the turgid movie that stands behind it.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> You'll see cowboys, you'll see aliens, and you'll see the cowboys fight the aliens. The filmmakers seem to think the very idea is clever and bold enough to carry a two hour movie
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> It really is "Aliens'' on the open plains, "Independence Day'' for the nation's centennial, and what the movie lacks in originality and stick-to-your-ribs Western authenticity, it makes up for in pell-mell multiplex entertainment.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Will somebody please stand up and give me some different aliens.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> "Cowboys & Aliens" is exactly what it sounds like: a cowboy movie and an alien movie thrown together, a genre mash-up that's more fun than good, but pretty good nonetheless.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> What makes the movie work, really, is that above and beyond the conventions themselves doing their jobs, the actors seem truly invested...
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Neither a Western nor an alien film, really, just another Hollywood blockbuster massaged and pruned within an inch of its life.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Cowboys & Aliens is one of the silliest movies ever made, but so many otherwise serious people have attached their names to it that, as Arthur Miller wrote in Death of a Salesman, attention must be paid.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> The Jon Favreau film brandishes a literal-minded title as laughable as the rest of its action.
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Favreau slipped from fresh and flamboyant on "Iron Man" to lame and listless on its sequel, and there's more of the latter on "Cowboys & Aliens."
770863875 <###> Cowboys & Aliens <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Cowboys & Aliens is a nearly exact description of the conflict at the heart of Jon Favreau's latest film. A better one is Cliche & Exposition.

770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> This was a film that was so soulless and so lifeless that it had not made a single bit of impact while it was playing.

770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> I LIKEanthroped it.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> I don't think this was meant to be funny, but I found it pretty darn amusing.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Also missing... most of the so-called Lycans who, their appearance in a few respectable action sequences notwithstanding, are now nearly extinct. So is this franchise.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> A sloppy, messy, frankly dumb action/horror hybrid, but at least it moves quickly and delivers the goods.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> UNDERWORLD AWAKENING is definitely gory, but someone forgot to also make it scary, exciting, sexy, and/or fun.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> It's too soon to name the worst movie of 2012, but this one sets the bar pretty high -- er, low.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> A swift, brutal, and thoroughly competent actioner that doesn't balk at a bit of bloodletting. Arriving between parts one and two of Twilight's interminable swan song Breaking Dawn, nothing could be more welcome.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> The directors ignore the hokey and increasingly busy mythology of past entries to serve up a nonstop bloodbath: The violence is surprisingly extreme, goofily absurd and gratifyingly coherent.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> It's not awful, merely functional and lacking an identity now that the lore of previous entries has been abandoned.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> The Underworld series hits a palpable low with this absolutely interminable entry...
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> A typical vampire of the future film, but Beckinsale looks great in leather
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Twilight: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 is coming out later this year, right? So at least this will only be the 2nd worst vampire vs. werewolf movie of 2012.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Brief but bloody and best enjoyed in zombie mode.

770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> The combat quotient, to the movie's credit, is way up, with narrative folderol kept to a minimum.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The most generic entry of the bunch.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> There's not much to this movie beyond a slick procession of dark, gleaming violence.

Don't expect much more than this.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> with Awakening, the vampires-vs-werewolves Underworld franchise has finally decayed beyond the point of repair.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> This is pulp horror with a dollop of science fiction... with the cast elevating the material above the gore and CGI effects.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> Super-slick; and it is irritating and chaotic and dumb as a box of rocks... All the Kate Beckinsales in all the catsuits in all the world can't face that down.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The carnage occasionally pauses to allow Beckinsale a moment to emote over lost love or seek a fleeting bond with a screen partner, but soon more beasts are on hand, and the soulless slaughter hastily recommences.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Kate Beckinsale is back...and ready to cash her paycheck.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.125 <###> The only thing that manages to outpace Underworld: Awakening's ineptitude is its utter soullessness.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Brief but pointless and so incredibly preposterous and ponderous that it feels like an exceptionally weak fan-fiction piece than a professionally-produced screenplay

770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Crude, cheap and pointless, this surely drives a stake through the heart of the 'Underworld' franchise.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> It's hard to get over the feeling that fans are being cheated with a film designed to extract the admission fee from their wallets whilst offering very little in return.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Not a complete disaster, but also not the vampire / werewolf mash we've always wanted.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.35 <###> Murky and perpetually bluish in tinge, Underworld: Awakening does and gets little with the 3-D in which it's being offered, and ends by shamelessly setting up a further and fatally unnecessary installment.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> It's not awful enough to be considered truly dreadful but it's just shockingly asleep for a movie subtitled "Awakening."
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> With no Michael Sheen this time around and Charles Dance stepping in for an AWOL Bill Nighy, there's a distinct sense of sloppy seconds to a film that's humourless throughout and, thanks to murky 3D, visually dull to boot.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> It may not be great filmmaking, and it won't attract new fans, but those already invested will be able to satiate their bloodlust with the return of Beckinsale's sleek and sexy Selene.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> While there's plenty of action, blood and deaths, somehow the storyline, which connected the audience with the characters, got muddled along the way and with a lackluster 3D appearance, the film certainly isn't worth the time or money.
770863877 <###> Underworld Awakening <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> All things considered, 'Underworld: Awakening' is at least on par with its predecessors. By the fourth go-around, it ought to be striving for more than average.

493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Without the aid of substances, Reno 911!: Miami is as much in need of laughs as its characters are in need of a collective brain transplant.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> There are laughs here but the overall levity level seems more in line with a TV movie. I mean, why does the chicken cross the road? No, really. Why?
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> So bawdy, so unfunny, and so unlike its small screen roots that after the first 30 minutes I was so desperate to change the channel.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> An utterly inane whodunit more in search of a cheap joke than the perpetrators of any crime.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Hearkens back to comedy classics like Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach, specifically in the areas of quality control, production value and chuckle quota.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The Reno 911! movie is a lot like the Reno 911! TV show except everybody's naked and it's not as funny.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Broken up into four episodes of the television show, who knows, this might be a masterpiece. Seen at one sitting, it falls well short of that. Not for lack of trying. More for trying a little too hard.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Has its crude little charms, but for a movie based upon such a cutting and acerbic series there is no excuse for how forgettable it ultimately is.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> As a movie, it's like a spandex banana hammock stretched out over Lt. Dangle's crotch. Funny, but frighteningly thin.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> It is marred by a lack of inspiration, some flat celebrity cameos, and the same gay jokes and identical situations over and over again.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> For funny, it's not even on the same map of the former Soviet Union as, say, Borat. But the straight-outta-cable Reno 911: Miami is funnier than Super Troopers and at least four of six Police Academys.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The film's longer running time means more dead spots and the more elaborate stunts demand tighter scripting and less room to improvise, which is a shame since improvisation is the Reno gang's real strength.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The actors behind this show are far more talented than this movie suggests -- many of their funniest quirks haven't made the final cut -- and there's no excuse beyond simple quick-buck greed for such a sloppy effort.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> It's a pure delight that the show's genius performance troupe has assembled one of the highest-concept, lowest-brow, most uproarious movie debuts since the surprise sensation of last year's cable crossover Borat.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> While the characters are funny in Reno 911!: Miami, they really could use a straight man, or at least someone who isn't totally incompetent. There are plenty of Bob Goldthwaits in the cast, but no Steve Guttenberg.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> People unfamiliar with the show might find the movie amusing. People unaware of the Keystone Kops might find it hilarious. But for fans of the series, the movie plays like a stretched-out version of one of the less-stellar episodes.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> A formulaic, unfunny farce that will leave you nostalgic for Police Academy.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The gags vary -- a tattooed-breast mystery kinda sags -- but there are lots of laughs.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's a lot easier to pack laughs into a half-hour television show than a full-length feature film, and if you need proof, you'll find 84 minutes of it in Reno 911!: Miami.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The film is just a loosely connected set of skits in which incompetent, narcissistic Nevada cops prove just as inept and self-absorbed in Florida.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Reno 911!: Miami starts to wear out its welcome right around the 30-minute mark. Had it been made as a two-part episode of the series, with a week in between for our memories to lapse, we might not have noticed this is just more of the same.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> For the most part, this movie feels like a just-missed effort.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> This low-rent, nonsense cop business filled me with a nostalgic twinge. I didn't know I wanted the Police Academy series resurrected with a lot more hilarity, but I'm glad somebody did it.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The humor is arresting, and boredom is thrown into lockdown.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Sadly, there's not much of an arresting development from the lovable nitwits from Nevada.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's a film chock-full of violent slapstick, sexual innuendo (or downright blatant sexual depiction) and dirty jokes... I found myself laughing quite a bit.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> While it's intermittently amusing, none of this was appointment television to begin with, so it's hard to imagine big crowds shelling out for it at the multiplex.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> What feels amusingly anarchic on the small screen feels underdeveloped and disjointed on the big screen, perhaps because instead of commercials gluing the jokes together there's dead air.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Instead of creating a movie, the Reno 911 gang has made a dumber version of their TV show, while adding curse words and nudity, which is what I would expect from 10-year olds.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> As a TV show, Reno 911! is diverting and amusing; as a motion picture, it's overlong and wears out its welcome. The film offers some solid laughs, but not enough to justify sitting through 80 minutes of the faux cops' antics.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> ...moves the group to Florida for a police convention, but its emphasis on caught-on-tape idiocy remains.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Aside from uncensored profanity and unpixelated nudity, the Reno 911!: Miami never really stretches its legs, and instead often feels more like a stretched-out half-hour episode.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Reno 911!: Miami is pretty much a feature-length movie version of a television show that sometimes has trouble finding enough material for even one 30-minute episode.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Reno does manage a titter here and a giggle there. But it's a cheap, dumb, obvious movie. How cheap? The big screen never seemed so small.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Big laughs are spaced out by a lot of dead air in between.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> By all rights, such a slapdash formula shouldn't work. And yet, this is a movie that gives fans of the show pretty much everything they could want.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> While you may laugh here and there, if you wait for the DVD you can skip the slow sections for the high points.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Comedy Central's Reno 911! -- a spoof of the police ride-along show Cops -- takes a shot at stretching the concept into a feature-length film. Unusual for this misfit crew, the shot pretty much hits its intended target.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> For the poor souls deprived by their lack of basic cable, this is a decent introduction to the characters and the show without all those pesky bleeps and blurs.
493912277 <###> Reno 911!: Miami <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Overlong and unimaginative, this inflammation of the usually hilarious Comedy Central show goes to great lengths to justify its extended running time, but winds up repeating its jokes before the first act is over.

16681 <###> Total Recall <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Total Recall's caricaturing of Schwarzenegger, its flip ribbing at his stocks of action-hero cache, signal the deep, almost atomic level at which its satire functions.
16681 <###> Total Recall <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> When the leader of the rebels turns out to be Baby Herman from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, it's clear that the satirical bull's-eyes Verhoeven nailed in RoboCop have here been turned into a more benign state of rib-nudging.
16681 <###> Total Recall <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> It's not a masterpiece, but it is a fast-moving thriller, one worth revisiting (and, evidently, remaking).
16681 <###> Total Recall <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> It's still a guilty pleasure - though the guilt quotient is a bit higher - and that's down to the still-extraordinary presence of the massively gym-built Arnold...

16681 <###> Total Recall <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Say what you will about Verhoeven's penchant for extravagant theatrics, when he's not yanking the arms off people or putting bullets in their forehead, he tells a good story.
16681 <###> Total Recall <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Thought-provoking, flashy, and FULL of action!

16681 <###> Total Recall <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Verhoeven keeps the whole thing chugging along neatly with a huge dollop of ultra-violence and gore. Schwarzenegger is at his best ever.
16681 <###> Total Recall <###> Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> You'd think by the year 2084 villains would have learned they shouldn't mess with Mr. Biceps. But no-o-o-o.

10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.25 <###> A worst-case scenario of what happens when an actor turns director.

10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Certainly more interesting than your standard romantic comedy, yet it is, first and foremost, a Hollywood product, and that necessitates a certain amount of distance from anything that might really make the audience think.

10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Even with its few flaws, it's a decent little film that manages to balance slapstick comedy while not shying away from the lead characters' issues of faith.

10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> It's a gimmicky storyline to be sure, but even the best lame bar joke has never had me in stitches the way this whimsical and ingenuous romantic comedy did.
10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> It's certainly a pleasant enough diversion, good for more than enough chuckles to make it worth a look, but it's surprisingly timid for a film that tries to cover so many thematic elements.
10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> What finally decides the fate of Keeping the Faith is its utter likability.
10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> This is a film that beats a lot of odds to be an intelligent romantic comedy that is constantly entertaining.
10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.7 <###> n an age of cynicism, it's an amiable, old-fashioned romantic comedy, a light-hearted date movie.

10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.25 <###> Just bad from Norton you expect more.
10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Rarely does the material rise to meet the level of competence exhibited by its very talented cast, which tries in vain to make the film better.
10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> It's nothing to, ahem, preach about.
10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> It loses energy and becomes repetitious and unnecessarily cumbersome.

10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Everything seems too glossy, crises are resolved too easily, situations seem pat.
10687 <###> Keeping the Faith <###> Comedy;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Director Edward Norton fails to impose any kind of unique stamp on the rather deliberate screenplay.
10685 <###> Race with the Devil <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> Race with the Devil doesn't quite measure up to Mad Max or even Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry as a drama, but with its thrills, mystery and legitimate scares, this film is an unquestionable good time.

770808669 <###> Terror of Tiny Town <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> That infamous midget Western, and weirdly entertaining. Well worth a glimpse.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> The jarhead action, intentionally crappy parody songs, melange of terrorist gibberish and semi-sensible anatomical analogies for foreign policy all let "Team America" rowdily resurrect the Zucker Brothers' spirit of peerless, puerile genre satire.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Raunchy action comedy from South Park team isn't for kids.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.77 <###> Putting the fun back into misanthrope
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> As usual, heart and soul have been poured into an enterprise that Parker and Stone want you to think they just knocked off after a night of smoking weed.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> ...hurt by Parker and Stone's reliance on speechifying and heavy-handed diatribes...
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Bottom line: nice puppetry, crappy movie.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> So what if the political satire is as thin as wax paper?...In the end, the gleeful action, absurd silliness and crude pleasures outweigh the film's weaknesses.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> The year's smartest, most impressive comedy.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The puppets are extremely impressive and the fact that the strings are constantly visible is used to brilliant comedic effect, particularly during one of the film's crudest scenes.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.87 <###> "Will have you howling with laughter, unable to stop even to catch breath."
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> A hilariously irreverent look at post-9/11 America.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The result seems almost as hypocritical as many of the movie's targets, which ultimately defeats the movie's intentions.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> Why puppets? The form meets function.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Surprisingly good natured given its take-no-prisoners lampooning of ethnic and cultural stereotypes, the war in Iraq, homosexuality, AIDS... not to mention Hollywood's finest.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Screamingly, achingly funny. It's the kind of movie that repeatedly hits a comic high note and holds it for a sustained period.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> I never imagined that the current geopolitical scenario could be boiled down so succinctly, or cleverly, into a five minute speech about "P*ssies", "D*cks", and "A**holes".
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> Like a fantasy project developed by a dirty-minded child, and we can all share in the adolescent stupidity and irresponsibility of it. It's a blast.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Armed with an offbeat intelligence...Team America: World Police is a diabolically spunky punch to the political groin that takes no prisoners... doesn't miss a naughty beat
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's so accurate that it's barely parody.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> [The] real target is the polarized state of society. All extremes get an equal bashing here, as they well deserve.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> makes a surprisingly cogent, if gleefully vulgar, political argument that has legs because it doesn't take easy sides
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Although it can get a bit wearing on me to watch puppets, this is so well written and so tongue in cheek, that it was a pleasure.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The thing is silly as hell and having Kim Jong Il sound like Eric Cartman from "South Park" is a stroke of genius. This is a very funny film and should be seen forthwith.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Juvenile in the worst sense: confused and frightened by the adult world, and begging to be protected.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Shocking, funny, and socio-politically astute
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> About a third of Team America exhibits deliriously trashy bad taste, but most of the rest is just tasteless to the point of being infantile.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Trey Parker and Matt Stone do what they do best - provide the character voices, poke fun at everything, and write semi-genius songs to place between the off-color humor.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Juvenile? Sure. Funny? Certainly -- though not nearly as often as one might reasonably expect from these guys.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The satirical sharpness that defines the duo's at-times incandescently brilliant "South Park" has been shunted aside in favour of vomit gags and screaming homophobia.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Surprisingly free of painful barbs.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There are too many gags that fall flat and the strain of an all-marionette cast shows all too often.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Laugh hard, laugh long, but just laugh at true greatness.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> Gleefully profane, excessively violent, and refreshingly lewd.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It's a mess, an all over the place, everything but the kitchen sink jamboree of potty humor, cheap shots and missed opportunities.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Team America is a poke in the nose, a kick in the pants to namby-pamby types afraid of offending anyone. It's rather liberating, which, is what Team America is all about.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Team America: World Police is controversial, vulgar, and politically incorrect. Bless Parker and Stone for making it.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> I haven't laughed myself to tears in a while, but this movie made it happen... doesn't quite hold itself together all the way through, otherwise it might've been a slam dunk.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Using the "F" word fifty million times is not brilliant script writing
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Trey Parker may not advance the cause of freedom, but he'll go to it laughing, and that's worth several times my buck-o-five.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> ... one of the funniest films you'll ever feel (this) uncomfortable about laughing out loud at... remember: if you laugh, the terrorists win.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Many other critics have praised it, but I find it hard to enjoy a film so offensive. Be sure to keep kids away.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Jonathan Swift said: "Satire is a sort of glass, wherein beholders do generally discover everybody's face but their own." Trey Parker are Matt Stone are fiendish satirists.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Team America puts Michael Moore and company to shame by being fair and balanced in its comic assault on the left and right.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> For giggling, politically savvy homo-repressed teenagers, Team America: World Police is hardly as funny as it should be so it gets 2 stars -- make it 3 if you sniff glue.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A film that earns the phrase satire, Team America is a film thatt understands neo cons and celebrities are really led by their strings.

16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Team America is not as funny as the South Park movie, and some of its juvenile humor falls flat. But when Team America works, it falls squarely into the category of guilty pleasure.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The gags fall flat as often as they hit their mark.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Funny string-driven action satire.

16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> As puppetry, Team America is stilted. As satire, it's gutless and lazy. And as comedy, it barely delivers laughs.
16974 <###> Team America: World Police <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Three times in the course of Team America: World Police I laughed so hard I thought I was crying, and when I checked, sure enough.

10535 <###> Always <###> Drama;Romance;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> For all its Spielbergian action and production values, the film is painfully sappy and wastes its A-list cast by saddling them with a hamfisted script.

314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> There's a lot of tough talk from tough men in this testosterone-fueled thriller, as the thin blue line disintegrates amid gritty give-and-take in William Monahan's excellent script.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.9 <###> The Departed is a near-perfect synthesis of cinematic genius and commercial appeal, quite possibly the most accomplished and accessible film from one of the greatest living directors.

314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> This is Scorsese's Serpico, his French Connection, his Heat, and he brings the same eye for anthropological detail to the boys in blue as he does to his beloved wiseguys.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Scorsese finds himself back in his comfort zone with a crime epic about loyalty and deception that's deeply engaging and viciously entertaining from start to bloody finish.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.9 <###> Urban film making at its best, The Departed is a brutally violent, beautifully crafted, and incredibly well acted piece of film making that will leave you reeling.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.59 <###> The film is superbly shot, and the rapid-fire editing and shaky camera fit the constant flux that the main characters find themselves in time and again.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Much splat, little art
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Scorsese isn't about plots; he's about people, places, and times, and until he departs from that, this film is a return to genius.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> One of the year's very best and most exciting films.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.9 <###> The Departed heralds Martin Scorsese's return to the top of his game and simultaneously secures for the film a place in the pantheon of the very best of American crime cinema. Welcome back to Scorsese's mean streets.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Scorsese revisits old territory in The Departed, and he doesn't do anything he hasn't done brilliantly several times before.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> Probably the director's most taut piece of storytelling since Goodfellas.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> What makes this a Scorsese film, and not merely a retread, is the director's use of actors, locations and energy, and its buried theme. I am fond of saying that a movie is not about what it's about; it's about how it's about it.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.86 <###> Sometimes accused of failing to harness the kinetic energy that abounds in his films, Martin Scorsese has done such a fine job of balancing the heat and the cold here.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The Departed doesn't improve in any way on Infernal Affairs, which served up a return to stylish Hong Kong action.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> An over-plotted, pressure-cooked crime caper directed by Martin Scorcese which touches on every classic theme imaginable.

314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> You'll have to go back to GoodFellas to find a Marty movie this fun, this enamored of language, of ethnic slurs, of "Gimme Shelter," of explosive violence. Scorsese's return to form is the year's most dynamic film. Really, how could it not be?
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> ...the best thing the director has done in years.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> The cast was a blast, playing each part off one another like a great chess match set up via the poetic images swirling through Scorsese's mind.

314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> And is there a better director working today that can find just the right song to capture the mood of the story on screen?
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> No esta entre lo mejor de Scorsese, pero es un buen policial con algunos momentos intensos, una vertiginosa narracion casi sin pausas, y un estupendo elenco (a pesar de Jack, que excede su personaje).
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> A welcome departure from all the banal fare we've been presented with over the last few months. The Departed is how movies are supposed to be made.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Apesar de levemente inferior ao longa chines, este e um filme vigoroso que demonstra a habilidade de seu diretor em conduzir tramas violentas e complexas.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Another very good gangster movie from Martin Scorsese, and a faithful remake
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Suffers in comparison to the tension, subtlety, and top-drawer acting in Infernal Affairs.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> These may not be the streets of [Scorsese's] past, but they are just as mean and just as compelling.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Scorsese has long since proved to be a master at gangland crime dramas and The Departed is no exception.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Sweeps us along helplessly, basking in the sheer energy of it all.

314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> This would not be the movie it is without Nicholson's unforgettable, over-the-top, deliciously-obscene performance.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> Like a sucker punch to the gut, and I do mean that as a compliment.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.9 <###> This is, without a doubt, one of 2006's best movies, another milestone for a man whose career path is paved with such accolades.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> Martin Scorsese nous revient dans sa meilleure production en plus de 10 ans (depuis Goodfellas en fait)...
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> The Departed is an enjoyable, but overlong crime caper with some great performances and plenty of moments that scream 'Scorsese!' But you know what? The Aviator is a better movie.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> [A] glorious mess of a movie.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> An intricate music box of cinematic flair but utterly hollow as a personal statement.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> ... while not glorifying the gun culture of this nation, [the film] exposes it in a sea of blood ...

314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> Stacked up against Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, sure ... this is lesser Scorsese. And 'lesser' Scorsese is still better than almost anything else around.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> It's a testament to the rest of the cast that Nicholson's self-worshipping train-wreck of a performance doesn't sink the entire film.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> Scorsese's best in years-strong praise considering that his last two movies were both up for the Best Picture Academy Award.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8125 <###> The only thing that surprises me more than thinking the former Marky Mark is one of the most talented actors working today is that I think his New Kids on the Block brother Donnie is just as good.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Given the powerhouse punch of a scenario, it's perhaps not surprising that Scorsese elected to rework someone else's property while also embellishing it with his own distinctive style.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> A wholly remarkable work -- one that is considerably deeper and certainly more complex than its crime thriller status might imply.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.9 <###> Scorsese nails nearly every scene perfectly. There's not a moment your mind wanders, your toe taps restlessly or you dare to miss a scene by glancing at your watch.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> Intense and entertaining.

314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> ...riveting and fearless in its intriguing scope. The Departed beats us upside our heads with a flashy fury that stings more caustically than an avenging queen bee.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> This is crime melodrama as only Scorsese can deliver it, even if we sense in the edges of the frame that he's subtly laughing at the over-ripeness of it all.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Martin Scorsese returns to gangland in The Departed, a slick, soulful retelling of overrated Hong Kong actioner Infernal Affairs.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> A great film? To some degree. Great fun? Absolutely. One of the year's best films? Most certainly

314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> Redolent of four-letter words, Scorsese's flatulent Boston massacre doesn't amount to a hill of beans ... It's easily his worst film since Cape Fear. How bad is GoodFellas Does Boston? So bad that even Nicholson is a deadly bore.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> As in most of Scorsese's films, the wages of sin are pretty harsh, but then, so are the wages of virtue.

314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Watching this new film by Scorsese is tantamount to falling in love again with the brash, cinematic bad boy from New York City.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> This is a Martin Scorsese film of the classic sort. It has a high body-count and moments of sublime excess; the master is on form.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.9 <###> Martin Scorsese must have missed the memo stating that Hollywood movies were being dumbed down for mass audiences.

314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.9 <###> Nicholson, as usual, overacts to great effect. But the star is DiCaprio who emerges from this film as a complete actor and a full-fledged star... (with) a big assist from Wahlberg, who is captivating in the few minutes he has on screen.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> Great filmmaking, especially if you don't hold it up to Scorsese's masterpieces or to Infernal Affairs.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> If you like your films loaded with guns, blood and bad asses with dialects this is the film for you. Scorsese delivers a well-crafted story that will keep you engaged throughout.

314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> That Scorsese can hit this kind of material out of the park isn't surprising, and much of The Departed gleams with a certain well-honed perfection.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> As The Departed wears on, it becomes more exciting, more grimly funny and more nihilistic -- and that nihilism has a lasting impact.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Crime stories have become incredibly generic, and though this is not a pit like Miami Vice, some bursts of good staging and imagery only serve to remind us that Scorsese is a streak gambler who can get stuck with the wrong hand.

314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> Scorsese differentiates it from everything else he's ever done. The guy might as well retire now because I don't see how he's going to top this one.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Despite its jazzy energy and many stunning set pieces, Scorsese's latest film is a regrettably uneven addition to the director's canon, paling in comparison to such classics as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> Freed from iconic figures and weighty themes, Martin Scorsese, in The Departed, gets to riff and rock. And the audience gets a huge, bloody, profane entertainment in the bargain.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> The Departed is Scorsese's most entertaining picture in years, dense, violent (more of his screen sadism played for laughs), and satisfying.

314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> As so often before, the body count is high in a Martin Scorsese movie. But where once the bodies pulsated with life in all its vainglorious furor, here they drop like wooden ducks in an artificial pond.
314387087 <###> The Departed <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Scorsese hurries through scenes with an impatience that suggests boredom. Spontaneous violence doesn't shock us anymore in Scorsese's environments. Even the director's reliable technicians let him down.

377510718 <###> The Good Shepherd <###> Drama;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> De Niro deserves credit for the broad, ambitious canvas he's worked on, but his movie is just as mechanical and humourless as his protagonist.
377510718 <###> The Good Shepherd <###> Drama;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> On paper this had "belter" written all over it. Sadly, Damon's lifeless performance in the lead role failed to keep me gripped throughout the movie's bum-numbing 167 minutes.

377510718 <###> The Good Shepherd <###> Drama;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Overlong and a little overstuffed, but De Niro's ambitious tale of the CIA's Cold War genesis is still worthy, smart and relevant.
377510718 <###> The Good Shepherd <###> Drama;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> De Niro juggles the myriad big-picture parts with reserved professionalism; it's the central character, ironically, that's the movie's Achilles' heel.
377510718 <###> The Good Shepherd <###> Drama;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Any time The Good Shepherd tries to get dramatic, it goes limp from the effort, straining to impress us with the human cost of the Cold War spy game.
377510718 <###> The Good Shepherd <###> Drama;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> The Good Shepherd feels authentic because it keeps everything on a human scale. There's no mythologizing the agency; there's just a solid depiction of how it was shaped by human beings.

770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.73 <###> The House of the Devil is not only set in the early '80s, but director Ti West chose to shoot and structure the film in a way so as to make it feel like it was made in the early '80s. In a way, this throwback style is reminiscent of what Quentin Ta
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.625 <###> Although the payoff is creepy, it takes a little too long to arrive -- and when it does, it's about as worn-out as the movie's title.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.6 <###> West's assured way with widescreen framing, long takes and silences followed by sharp if explainable noise are almost cruelly funny in their heart-stopping pleasures.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.9 <###> As much as the slow pacing, the out-of-time quality creates a sense of dislocation, that makes what's coming for her even more unpleasant.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.8 <###> Impressively directed with impeccable production design, this is a note-perfect pastiche of a 1980s horror film that's both suspenseful and scary without resorting to cheap tricks.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.7 <###> After years of vivisectionist splatter, here is a horror movie with real shivers.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.625 <###> West avoids cliche and cheesiness with wise casting choices. Donahue's naturalistic performance is as persuasive as the subtly sinister portrayals by Tom Noonan and Mary Woronov.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.75 <###> A slightly faster set-up, and slightly more drawn-out climax, would make this even better.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.7 <###> skims away so much of the noisy and excessive cliches of today's terror flicks that it feels like a breath of fresh air
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.8 <###> When the Karo syrup finally hits the fan, the film loses its footing some, but only because no concrete explanations could possibly do justice to West's expert buildup.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.875 <###> From his era-appropriate soundtrack to the visual style of his opening credits and his slyly reverential camerawork, West gives his movie the look and feel of a 25-year-old relic, yet nothing about 'Devil' seems stale.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.85 <###> A fine example of how a talented filmmaker can tackle a horror sub-genre in a way that's stylistically reverential but also original in its own way.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.8 <###> Written, directed, and edited by Ti West, this movie is an old-school tension builder, slowly ratcheting up the anxieties of the audience who, of course, is fully aware that something bad is going to happen.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.8 <###> Carefully, perfectly, beautifully built occult horror follows the roadmap of the early '70s and '80s Indie Screams with reverent precision and the occasional, wise reference to the cannon.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.7 <###> Slow, yet oddly spellbinding, horror film ... a living, breathing nostalgia piece oozing period authenticity
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.8 <###> This pitch-perfect genre throwback would be right at home among the creaky and weird supernatural thrillers of the 70's and 80's. (And yes, I mean that as a compliment.)
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.7 <###> Start[s] to add up after a while to a faintly unbearable level of dread.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.875 <###> Puts to shame most major studio horror releases. Classy even while getting down-and-dirty, unusually savvy about the importance of tension and character nuance over viscera and a soulless body count.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.6 <###> Not a bad venture into the "girl meets devil" genre but a few rock songs short of a hit.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.8 <###> To knock this movie for being slow is like knocking Airplane! for being silly. You might not dig the approach, but that doesn't make it a flaw.
770806327 <###> The House of the Devil <###> Horror <###> 0.75 <###> Yet another of this year's homage-facsimiles, The House of the Devil forgoes campy self-awareness in favor of reverential faithfulness--and in doing so, implicitly critiques contemporary horror cinema.
301425174 <###> Evil Aliens <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Before he started turning out $200 million fantasy epics, Peter Jackson used to do this sort of thing while napping, and he was much better at it.
301425174 <###> Evil Aliens <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> While nowhere near as witty as Shaun of the Dead (2004), it has a rude energy and a go-for-broke willingness to try anything.
301425174 <###> Evil Aliens <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Gruesome schlock -- but whether it's beyond or beneath criticism is a matter of individual taste.
301425174 <###> Evil Aliens <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> After a lacklustre start, Evil Aliens builds up a crazed momentum.
301425174 <###> Evil Aliens <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Eventually wins us over, despite a hyperactive, amateurish filmmaking style
301425174 <###> Evil Aliens <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> To be fair, Evil Aliens is going for a very specific audience, and viewers who ordinarily enjoy this sort of thing will probably not be disappointed.
301425174 <###> Evil Aliens <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> It's splattery and loud and frantic and laden with wall-to-wall gore of the nastiest kind. And yes, I mean that in the nicest way possible.

15280 <###> Dream for an Insomniac <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's talky, clumsy and a bit trivial, but the talk is rarely dull, and there's an integrity about its clumsiness: It's harder to be smooth when you have things you really want to say.

321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Never less than enjoyable. All credit must go to Plowright and Friend, who give completely charming performances.

321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Unfortunately, the result is high melodrama, at once patronizing and predictable.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> It's an altogether satisfying drama -- the sort of movie some people complain they don't make anymore.

321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Plowright, who has made something of a specialty of breathing life into stereotypically written older women for the past 20 years, makes the most of a rare opportunity to play someone still open to the surprises the world can bring.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Just as teenagers enjoy escapist movies, so do the elderly. They simply prefer a gentler pace. What is touching about Mrs. Palfrey is that she is allowed to be elderly, and not turned into a hip-hop granny.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Ireland, who made the brilliant, equally unfashionable The Whole Wide World, respects the kindness and concern his characters show each other.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The whole thing feels programmed; the movie's sense of humor lacks understatement. So does the movie's sense of pathos.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Of course, sentiment in such pure form is hard to embrace. Without a realistic edge, it's like a flower arrangement: lovely for a short span, then prone to wilting.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Like a cup of strong British tea with a sugar cube tossed in, Dan Ireland's Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont is at once sweet and bitter, a fairy-tale friendship in the context of an achingly lonely life.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Director Dan Ireland ... pokes his way through the plodding story, but Plowright rides above it all with a performance loaded with grace notes and tenderness.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> It's funny, poignant, sweet, heartbreaking, and thoroughly entertaining. These are the kind of rich characters that make you want to pop round for a spot of tea.

321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The film is a quiet triumph for Dame Joan, who portrays Mrs. Palfrey's late-life journey into independence with a heart-tugging simplicity that can only come from a lifetime of great work.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> ...a terrific homage to the elderly, told in a touching, sometimes humorous, but always sensitive, manner with terrific performances by Joan Plowright and a charismatic Rupert Friend.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> ... tedious heart-tugger ...
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A sweet movie that fails to make the distinction between old age and death.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Humorous, bittersweet drama, proving that family can be found where you least expect it.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Dan Ireland gives us a bittersweet story of a May- December platonic relationship. Joan Plowright stars in what might be the best role of her career.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The story may sometimes overpower you with its honeysuckle sentiment and spiced bathos, but it's a movie that's self-aware enough to make winking references to such films as Harold and Maude and Brief Encounter.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> [A] terrific, long-overdue vehicle for Lady Olivier.
321835370 <###> Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Underneath the sweet, sometimes whimsical friendship of elegant, lonely old Mrs. Palfrey and the handsome young charmer ... lies a serious, melancholy movie about the isolation and marginalization of the elderly.

770679748 <###> Close to Eden (Urga) (Territory of Love) <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> The kind of movie that has no reason for existence, except to keep the viewer bemused. It does that with such sly charm that when it's over, you don't even think to ask why it was made. You're simply pleased that it was.
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> The Friday the 13th saga continues with this typically underwhelming entry...
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.375 <###> Not since Psycho has a movie taken such advantage of the phallic nature of slasher horror. [Blu-ray]
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.3 <###> ...the casting director continued to find young performers who were wonderfully cute people and woefully bad actors.
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> With this film, there's more sex, more nudity and more creative kills.
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.375 <###> easily the worst film in the series up until that point, partially because it was so redundant, but also because it is the most technically clumsy
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.375 <###> Shot in such a way to capitalize on the brief fad of Reagan-era 3D movies, there's less memorable POV shots from the killer and more images from the perspective of the victims.
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> As a tried-and-true slasher film, it has its moments, but ... it grows tedious by the end.
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.625 <###> Funky fresh disco chi chi chi
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.1 <###> So appallingly, overwhelmingly stupid that it is stupid even by the standards of the Friday the 13th franchise.

14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.0 <###> Let's see...13th x 3 = at least 39 beheadings.
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> Eventually, the novelty wears off, and what remains is the now-familiar spectacle of nice, dumb kids being lopped, chopped and perforated.
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> tends to play like Dr. Tongue's 3D House of Hackneyed Sight Gags.
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> It was great on the big screen in 3-D, but there's really no reason to watch it on video
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.6 <###> Without the 3-D it's nothing to get excited about.
14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.2 <###> It's in three dimensions, and all of them suck.

14236 <###> Friday the 13th Part 3 <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.27 <###> The film was shot in 3D and looks pretty bland on video or DVD.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This film is inventive, fascinating and endearing but also sketch-lite, a trifle dull in colour-muting 3D and emotionally detached.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> This DreamWorks release avoids emotion in favor of toon-time movement.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> I'll be doggoned if 'Mr. Peabody & Sherman' isn't a refreshing 'paws' from the run-of-the-mill movies that often serve as family entertainment
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The film has an excellent pro-education, pro-history, pro-science, pro-geek, pro-nerd, pro-smart message, a swathe of historical tidbits, and awesome progressive details such as a schoolmate in a wheelchair for no plot reason (and never commented on).
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> ...a vehicle that's as empty as it is entertaining.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The film has been a monster hit, so it's doing its dance with the demographic the way its supposed to. Still, one wonders whether fans of the original show will go with the bandwagon. This reviewer found the film plastic and too predictable.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Mr. Peabody proudly announces "there's no doubt about it...every dog should have a boy." And every boy (and girl) should go see "Mr. Peabody & Sherman."
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The Mr. Peabody and Sherman segments that aired on The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show were brief, witty, and charmingly slight, but this big-screen version is long, loud, and visually exhausting.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Too dull and mediocre to be interesting or interestingly bad.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> I thought it was really sweet. We've seen a couple of movies about adoption lately and there's something very sweet about that whole scenario as well.

771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> What's more surprising is how much of the original's spirit DreamWorks is able to inject into a feature film that'll entertain young 'uns as well as potentially cynical parents.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Nevertheless, it breezes by in a whoosh of colour, fan and good humour that will win it more friends than enemies.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> maintains just enough of the irreverent charm and ironic humor of the crudely drawn original series to balance out the sleekness of its new digital presentation
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It does right enough by the characters to please older fans, while also having enough appeal to capture the interest of children previously unacquainted with them.

771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The father-son emotional arc is a clunky and strained framework to the zippy entertainment, but like historical accuracy, it's very easy to ignore.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> as a lark for children that might give them some interest in the history of the world, Mr. Peabody & Sherman definitely does its job
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman has a heart and mind but the film is still a second-tier contender when compared with similar CGI animated movie offerings.

771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> "I forbid you from fighting in the Trojan War!" It's something any father would say to his son, provided that the pair regularly traveled through time.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Fifty years ago, animated entertainment was a lot quieter. But that was my "Mr. Peabody & Sherman." This is someone else's. And it should give them, and even a few open-minded parents, almost just as much giggly fun.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Designed to make a kid wonder why a throwaway joke about Einstein struggling with a Rubik's Cube is so darn funny.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It's better than OK, and a few elements sing; but overall it frustrates. Its delights come from its willingness to depart from formula, but formula still rules it.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman has a cool, midcentury-modern look (dog and boy live in a populuxe Manhattan penthouse) and a voice cast that may not be A-list but fits the bill nicely.
771169232 <###> Mr. Peabody & Sherman <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Mr. Peabody is fast-paced and jammed with rib-poking historical references, but it couldn't be called witty, even on the broadly winking level of the original cartoon.

771321139 <###> Maps to the Stars <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Ultimately, "Maps" doesn't take us anywhere we haven't been before, but it's an occasionally fascinating, if messy, ride.

771321139 <###> Maps to the Stars <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> David Cronenberg, master of horror both of body and mind, offers a Machiavellian tribute to Hollywood; an elaborate circus of errors that's not too far from the fake smiles and boardroom handshakes of the real thing.
771321139 <###> Maps to the Stars <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The dialogue bites and scratches and there is the sting of something like the truth in certain situations, but as the clunky plot laboriously joins the dots towards a melodramatic finale it all feels desperately obvious and not a little silly.

771321139 <###> Maps to the Stars <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Cronenberg's film takes place in a kind of pharmaceutically heightened hyper-reality of its own: it's not so much a twisted dream of making it in show-business, as a writhing, hissing, Hollywood waking nightmare.

771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Effie Gray is peculiarly compelling, even if the issue of sexual repression, all the Victorian manners, seem light-years gone and close to unfathomable.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Fanning feels wafer-thin and out of her element. She's appropriately wan, but as we never know Effie's potential, her loss of identity has minimal punch.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> While it has some lovely moments, "Effie Gray" is a bit underwhelming; it's odd that an artist so acclaimed for her wit would produce a script so chilly, so dour.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Thompson herself plays a sort of proto-feminist advisor, but the enemy here isn't misogyny so much as it is gynophobia.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Visually voluptuous, though the pacing occasionally suggests watching a Pre-Raphaelite dry.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Insomniacs should seek out Effie Gray if only for the sound night's sleep they will get after experiencing this inert snooze-fest.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The counterpoint of styles comments on Ruskin with irony and subtlety; as such it succeeds as criticism - and as art.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Listless and airless, and we yearn for Effie's emancipation largely so we can escape ourselves.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> "Effie Gray" is a powerful look at early feminism. Instead of accepting her fate in a bad marriage like many Victorian women advised her to do, Effie fights her way out of it - scandal be damned.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> This period piece, directed by Richard Laxton, is shot in such a grim and grainy fashion you long to turn on the lights - which is fitting, because you also wish the filmmakers had illuminated the characters a bit more clearly.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> It's a sumptuously elegant picture, but a disappointingly timid and decorous work that takes more care in outlining oppression than in creating a compelling protagonist. Her suffering is interesting, but she is not.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Thompson makes Ruskin such a cardboard villain, playing on stereotypes of the cold, stuffy intellectual, that she turns Gray's story into a tastefully dreary domestic-prison saga.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The movie has a very methodical pace, which sometimes verges on sluggish. And the soft focus of certain light-filled scenes doesn't make Effie look angelic so much as it makes the director appear amateurish.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The film itself begins to feel like Gray, a pretty bird in a gilded cage with nowhere to fly.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Fanning is a worthy muse for Thompson. She has developed into an actress who can convey considerable depth and feeling behind those haunting pale blue eyes.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Like watching paint dry on an exquisite masterpiece.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> We'll never know how mismatched Ruskin and Effie were in real life, but in Ms. Thompson's tactful but muted version of the truth, they seem to be in a stupor.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The Victorian melodrama in "Effie Gray'' works better than the Victorian suffering.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> A painfully obvious attack on the past and its regressive mores that does little but reward viewers for (hopefully) not being sexist pigs.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> The rare period piece that resists a helpful infusion of modern-day freshness, Effie Gray is entombed by the same emotional repressiveness that frustrated its namesake.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> When it comes to casting Fannings, if you can't get Elle, no Fanning is better than any Fanning available.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> A peculiar slice of 19th-century cultural life is mined to minimal effect in Effie Gray, a stillborn labour of love that doesn't justify the long slog from screenwriter and supporting player Emma Thompson required to bring this tale to the screen.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> It spins the narrative of one of the Victorian art world's most mysterious marriages into a study of life lived and life merely examined, a fecund fairy tale in reverse.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The tragic sadness of a Victorian wife and the unraveling of her marriage might be a worthy subject but, as brought to the screen by so reverently and bloodlessly, Effie Gray is a bit of a drag.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> A stultifyingly dreary costume drama that's far too timid and tasteful for its own good.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> It may be billed as a "love triangle", but there's precious little love on display, even in our heroine's growing affection for pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Set in London, Venice and the wilds of Scotland, Effie Gray is a very beautiful, elegant period drama.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> A fascinating, albeit strangely downbeat, costume drama.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> If ever a story cried out for the richly saturated, passionate tones of melodrama, it's Effie Gray.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Based on a notorious true story, this film takes a muted approach that matches the Victorian period and attitudes, which somewhat undermines the vivid emotions of the characters.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The film generates potent, often claustrophobic drama while never losing our sympathy for the fragile, resilient Effie.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> A marriage cut down by Victorian prejudice is at the centre of this intriguing, Emma Thompson-penned historical drama.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Well scripted, efficiently directed, handsomely dressed and furnished, and vigorously acted.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> An unexpectedly entertaining movie about this marital disaster and Gray's subsequent romance with the painter John Everett Millais.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Handsome, well-mounted but dull, dull, dull.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> There's little humour and - despite the best efforts of the cast - it's all a little stiff and one-dimensional.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> There are clever and sensitive touches right through, and a moving ending. But Fanning seems wholly uncomfortable, and not always intentionally.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Ultimately, this is an enjoyable, if slightly sluggish biopic that overcomes its flaws thanks to Thompson's way with dialogue, although it doesn't tug on the heartstrings as surely as you might hope.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> While admiring director Richard Laxton for this brooding, somewhat elusive piece, the audience are left to crave a defining, dramatic moment, or an impactful crescendo to illuminate this narrative.
771376039 <###> Effie Gray <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The result is dark and offbeat, but as a murky anti-romance, Gray is undeniably effective.
18352 <###> Top Hat <###> Romance;Musical & Performing Arts;Classics;Comedy <###> 0.56 <###> Most of what I liked about Top Hat centers around its two stars: full of energy and grace, they breathe life into the film whenever it threatens to lose its luster.
18352 <###> Top Hat <###> Romance;Musical & Performing Arts;Classics;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> If you want only one Astaire-Rogers musical, Top Hat is obligatory.
18352 <###> Top Hat <###> Romance;Musical & Performing Arts;Classics;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Top Hat does not glorify wealth or upper class status - if anything it continually pokes fun at it.
18352 <###> Top Hat <###> Romance;Musical & Performing Arts;Classics;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Because we are bound by gravity and the limitations of our bodies, because we live in a world where the news is often bad and the prospects disturbing, there is a need for another world somewhere, a world where Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers live.
18352 <###> Top Hat <###> Romance;Musical & Performing Arts;Classics;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> ...even after seventy years, the same elements delight us all over again. Good songs, good dancing, and good stars never go out of style.
18352 <###> Top Hat <###> Romance;Musical & Performing Arts;Classics;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Every musical number works, and the mistaken identity plot is pleasant enough, even if there's too much emphatic dithering from the supporting players towards the end.

770955414 <###> Underground Zero <###> Musical & Performing Arts <###> 0.875 <###> The results vary wildly, from long and rambling to minor masterworks.
770955414 <###> Underground Zero <###> Musical & Performing Arts <###> 0.6 <###> It's a little tacky but not unexpected.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Araki never digs deep enough, wasting the opportunity to expose Kat's resentments.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> This should be a profound character study, but the cliched use of flashbacks and the mawkish elements to the piece detract heavily from our own enjoyment.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> This dreamy/nightmarish weirdie finds Araki reining in his anarchic excesses with rewarding results, as his satirical sensuality reaps the benefits of a heavily orchestrated deadpan formality.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Araki blends film noir-like elements with an engagingly offbeat, Adrian Mole-like look at adolescence.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Shailene Woodley stars in a mystery thriller/coming-of-age drama that earns its third star from a kicker of a twist ending.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Is cinema broken? How is that a film by a director as significant as Gregg Araki ends up with such a tiny release? And an excellent film, at that?
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Araki has a habit of slowly fading from one scene to the next, perhaps in an effort to create a brooding atmosphere, but it's just plain soporific and the occasional bit of dry comedy offers scant relief.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The film is uneven, but it's fairly effective as a portrait of sexual awakenings during adolescence, even if there's nothing in it that you haven't seen before.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Not unlike most teenagers, it's a bit strange but a lot deeper than it looks. And it knows how to keep a secret.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The film falls to pieces at the end, but this is a watchable, well-acted drama, and Woodley gets better and better.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A more restrained effort from Araki than the headrush of Kaboom, there's plenty of fun to be had in Eva Green's Joan Crawford-esque turn as the vanished lady.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> An absorbing portrait of a woman, Gregg Araki continues to play exquisite corpse with film form.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> There's an unusual honesty to this film, which is an odyssey into the inner life of a teen girl...
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Is this a coming-of-age story or a whodunit? This heightened, luxurious melodrama...makes you wonder if the two genres are quite as different as you first thought.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Misses the energy and vitality of Gregg Araki's best work, but there's more going on here than immediately meets the eye.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> What's behind the surface of Araki's film is just more surface... little of its psychological explorations hold great weight.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> "A melodrama about numbness and detachment, writer-director Gregg Araki's adaptation of Laura Kasischke's novel is a paradox on paper and an anesthetized dud on screen."
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> "White Bird in a Blizzard" lingers in the mind long past its conclusion, a coming-of-age mystery with a dynamic lead heroine and an oddness that never loses sight of its resonance.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Green in particular seems to be channeling the bride of Frankenstein for half her scenes. It's an awkward mix of styles, and it doesn't work.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> An enjoyable, if uneven, adaptation of Laura Kasischke's coming-of-age novel about a teenage girl whose mother vanishes into thin air.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It's not a perfect film by any means - it moves slowly and meanders at times - but "White Bird" looks terrific, and for the most part features acting that's smart and subtle.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> 'White Bird in a Blizzard" develops engine trouble early on, right around the time it asks us to accept Eva Green as a desperate suburban housewife.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Oh, the small-town/suburban horror of it all.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> "White Bird in a Blizzard" is an odd little concoction, a coming-of-age story that, only in passing, is also a mystery.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There's a fine line between stylized and campy, and Araki defiantly crosses it, in any number of cringe-in-your-seat, can-you-believe-this-dialogue, my-gosh-that-feels-fake moments.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> There is absolutely no sense of danger ... for that matter, there's little urgency at all to answering what should have been the story's primary question.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> I'm not suggesting that all films need a grand purpose, but "White Bird in a Blizzard" doesn't work as mystery or character study.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> "White Bird in a Blizzard" is a film that doesn't quite know what it wants to be.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Woodley's depiction of Kat is low-key, natural and utterly unaffected; as she has in every role, she makes the character her own, with her scratchy little voice and level gaze.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Araki's beautifully told films make you feel warm and fuzzy... revealing a latent darkness that leaves you unsafe and unsettled. And these warring sensibilities have never felt more at odds (or at home) than in the campy, creeping dread of 'White Bird.'
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's a highly digressive film that keeps getting lost in worm holes - at once meandering and, in its individual passages, tightly focused.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> If [Woodley's] so capable in a film misfire like this, imagine her next solid production.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> With Woodley and Green nailing every note, and Araki infusing each beautifully shot scene with creeping menace, White Bird In A Blizzard's somewhat familiar story remains altogether mesmerizing.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> There's simply not enough of the rude passion that must have drawn Woodley to work with Araki in the first place.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> [A] clunky, ugly and dull mash-up of a mystery about a missing housewife - and her daughter's sexual coming of age.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> White Bird In A Blizzard has a distinctive, candy-coated look, sort of like if David Lynch designed snow-globes.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Araki has never made a boring movie, even if his brand of too-fast-too-soon sexual awakening has become something of a crutch.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Shailene Woodley, she who can do no wrong, finally makes a misstep in this embarrassing erotic coming-of-age mystery/thriller
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Gregg Araki's film suggests a hothouse melodrama that's been drained of the hothouse, the melodrama, and any other discernably dramatic stakes.

771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Loss pierces every moment of this melancholy mystery where everyone appears to be frozen in time and evil lurks behind suburbia's respectable facade.
771371845 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> White Bird in a Blizzard is styled like a Sirkian melodrama in which the bright and shiny surface conceals a bitterly ironic critique of American suburbia.

771307054 <###> Spring Breakers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Comedy;Cult Movies <###> 0.7 <###> Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers is rough around the edges, visually pleasing, experimental and a downright bizarre film, but one that's worthy of at least one viewing.

771307054 <###> Spring Breakers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Comedy;Cult Movies <###> 0.4 <###> Traditionally, spring break flicks are teen angst induced romantic comedies. Brain death is the best description. Spring Breakers is a totally new way to do that brain death.
771307054 <###> Spring Breakers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Comedy;Cult Movies <###> 0.7 <###> Arthouse filmmaker Harmony Korine (Mister Lonely) comes dangerously close to making a mainstream movie with this blackly comical thriller.

771307054 <###> Spring Breakers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Comedy;Cult Movies <###> 0.4 <###> You start the film wondering what the moral take on all this uninventive debauchery is going to be - is it a satire? - but then realise with dismay there is no take on offer at all.
771307054 <###> Spring Breakers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Comedy;Cult Movies <###> 0.2 <###> It's the kind of 'experimental' movie hailed as edgy, subversive and transgressive, when in fact it's inept, amateurish and loathsome.
771307054 <###> Spring Breakers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Comedy;Cult Movies <###> 0.4 <###> A tedious attempt to inject some style and artistic flair into the teen movie, combing outrageous behaviour with arty, slo-mo cinematography and a monotonous voiceover.

771307054 <###> Spring Breakers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Comedy;Cult Movies <###> 0.4 <###> The trouble is all in the film's wildly anxious structure, which feels largely dictated in the cutting-room by Korine going out of his way not to be accused of a message.
771307054 <###> Spring Breakers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Comedy;Cult Movies <###> 0.4 <###> As a director, Korine certainly has visual style (most of it seemingly knocked off from MTV Beach Party) but doesn't seem overly concerned with fleshing out any his buff bodies with character let alone dialogue.

771307054 <###> Spring Breakers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Comedy;Cult Movies <###> 0.6 <###> It's campy and comic at times, but Korine also gives the film a downbeat, melancholic edge, with voiceovers, pointed repetition of dialogue and images, and hallucinatory camera work, sound and editing.
771307054 <###> Spring Breakers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Comedy;Cult Movies <###> 0.6 <###> For all its absurdity and voyeurism, Korine brings to it a real authorial style.
771307054 <###> Spring Breakers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Comedy;Cult Movies <###> 0.4 <###> However self-aware Spring Breakers' sleaze is, there's something creepy about it as a male perspective on young women.

771307054 <###> Spring Breakers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Comedy;Cult Movies <###> 0.75 <###> Korine's story is a searing indictment of today's hedonistic, nihilistic youth, and his script is loaded with sharp, telling dialogue that exposes the rotten moral cores of its characters.
771307054 <###> Spring Breakers <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International;Comedy;Cult Movies <###> 0.5 <###> The subject of the film is the perversion of youth, and its greatest achievement (if one can call it that) is how it somehow manages to pander to a youth audience while also cinematically chiding them.

771379877 <###> Monsters: Dark Continent <###> Drama;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> This works as a standalone picture with its own distinctive take on alien invasion but also expands what now seem like a franchise with potential to deliver more and varied snapshots of human behaviour in extreme circumstances.

771205009 <###> The Strange Case Of Angelica <###> Drama;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Some dreamlike photography and a soothing musical score are pluses but slow, draggy telling is likely to frustrate the viewer.
771205009 <###> The Strange Case Of Angelica <###> Drama;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> The Strange Case of Angelica is indeed strange and unsettling. What it isn't is compelling or satisfying.
771205009 <###> The Strange Case Of Angelica <###> Drama;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> An uneven but intriguing piece of whimsy that veers from powerfully symbolic cinematography into self parody.
771205009 <###> The Strange Case Of Angelica <###> Drama;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> A quiet tale, told through a rarely moving camera and a playful, bewitching smile.
771205009 <###> The Strange Case Of Angelica <###> Drama;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> The narrative unreels with the simplicity of a silent movie; many scenes are shot from a single camera set-up with few cuts, the shadowy, stagy interiors backed by Chopin, as if it were a live piano accompaniment.
771205009 <###> The Strange Case Of Angelica <###> Drama;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> Nearly every shot in this new movie contains one glory or another.

771205009 <###> The Strange Case Of Angelica <###> Drama;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> "The Strange Case of Angelica" tells its tale of love and death with a captivating mix of formality, ambiguity and offbeat humor. On the surface a simple fable, it's actually much more.
771205009 <###> The Strange Case Of Angelica <###> Drama;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> While it is evidently the work of an artist with great stores of wisdom and a long view of history, it also has a playful, wry quality that can only be described as youthful.
771205009 <###> The Strange Case Of Angelica <###> Drama;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> We think we're in for a weighty, Hitchcockian treatise on artistic obsession; Oliveira's intentions are a bit more impish, however, though no less profound.
771205009 <###> The Strange Case Of Angelica <###> Drama;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Probably too film school for most, this is a masterpiece by a master. A hard look at the disjunction of film and art in a ghostly setting.
771205009 <###> The Strange Case Of Angelica <###> Drama;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> After a century on this planet and seven decades in the cinema, Manoel de Oliveira has earned the right to turn out whatever type of film he chooses.
770685259 <###> The Piano Lesson <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> There is an element of magical realism to this story, not unlike Toni Morrison's Beloved, and that comes across well.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> Perry aims high, and doesn't embarrass himself in tackling this iconic but dated play.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.1 <###> "For Colored Girls" features a lot of heartache and pain, but lacks any sense of purpose. It sacrifices depth for despair and suffers because of it.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> Best" and "worst", "good" and "bad" are judgment calls that seem unusually difficult to apply here... [Tyler Perry's] strangest and most endlessly fascinating film.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> Perry's awkwardly constructed screenplay and equally muddled direction is one 'metaphysical dilemma' not even these strong, and strongly gifted, women can conquer.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.4 <###> Tyler Perry movies certainly have their place in society, as they undoubtedly have a strong moral core and are made with noble intentions. On the evidence of For Colored Girls though, he should leave the serious drama alone.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.2 <###> Almost everyone in the cast is too talented for this.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.4 <###> It's refreshing to see an all black cast, in a film that places black women's stories front and centre; it's just a shame that the stories are such downers.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Director Tyler Perry has taken on a huge task in bringing Ntozake Shange's stage play For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf to the screen.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> 'For Colored Girls' doesn't do justice to the play it's based upon. However, the talent Tyler Perry has assembled here cannot be denied.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.2 <###> While gunning for the same empowering vibe as Waiting To Exhale, enduring this miserable effort from Tyler Perry is more like praying to expire.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.4 <###> Excruciating when it's bad, which is far too often, but a brave failure in lots of ways.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.4 <###> Perry crafts poorly paced soap opera, playing out in the most obvious and crass manner possible the situations that the poems subtly dance around. Shange's original text...
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.4 <###> At least an interesting failure.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.4 <###> Tyler Perry's drama is beautifully acted but Ntozake Shange's multiple, interlocking narratives ultimately defy his efforts to bring them to the screen.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.4 <###> So thickly does Perry lay on the sanctimony and self-pity, you begin to wonder if it's all a spoof. Stick a Wayans brother in there and you could call it Tragic Movie.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.7 <###> Tyler Perry goes art house with For Colored Girls -- and it's both alarming and wonderful to behold.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> The basic plot and acting are good but those stilted monologues are entertainment killers.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> ... Tyler Perry at his best, delivering at last on his promise ...
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.7 <###> [Perry] pulls off disturbing moments by finding conviction and vulnerability in his performers.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.375 <###> Can a mid-'70s play consisting of 20 monologues delivered by seven women survive the transition to movie screens in 2010? The short answer: not if it's adapted by Tyler Perry.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> The thought-provoking material about women paying a high price for making bad choices and ultimately finding their own voice may work on stage, but it's like putting a square peg in a round hole for a film.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.55 <###> Women may appreciate the message and sentiments expressed in Shange's words, but they would have been even more effective if incorporated into a stronger story.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> Director Tyler Perry's For Colored Girls is a bold example of an artist's reach exceeding his grasp. And it's hard not to applaud his determination and grade for ambition.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.875 <###> It has two undeniable virtues, however: Perry's bolder attitude as a writer and uniformly good work by his cast.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> Tyler Perry melodrama deals with intense, disturbing themes.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.4 <###> Characters barely described in the play get turned into Tyler Perry cliches.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> The entire film is suffocated by an inflated sense of self-worth - we are making a crucial movie of great pedigree about major underreported issues is the general attitude.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.375 <###> Any time [an actress] excels in a scene, its in spite of Perry's uninspired contributions behind the camera and not because of them.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> It's not a perfect vehicle, but the one thing that stands out is the amazing acting by the ensemble. If anything, the performances outweigh whatever flaws one sees.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> The movie ends with a group hug, but it takes date rape, STD's, a 'down-low' husband, teen pregnancy, girlfriend-beating, exorcism and even baby defenestration to get there.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> Retains some of the inherent power of it source and features some strong performances in the process but never finds the narrative cohesion needed to translate it to modern movie audiences.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> Perry gets points for persistence, yes, and for ambition. But that's not enuf.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.375 <###> Shange's words retain their power despite the melodramatic incidents Perry has woven to fill in the spaces between poems, his flat, TV-style direction and the highly variable performances of an all-star cast.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.25 <###> "For Colored Girls" may, in fact, be Perry's best film (not saying a lot, I know). It's certainly his first bid, as a director, for art-house respectability.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> While these two hours of hopelessness seem to argue that being an inner city black woman is the unluckiest roll of the dice, these ladies - even at their weakest - carry themselves with the confidence of winners, and we cling to their strength.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.25 <###> The film is a mawkish mess, only occasionally alleviated by the performances or Shange's poetry.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.7 <###> [Tyler Perry] sings the song the way he likes it - with force, feeling and tremendous sincerity.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> As often as Perry's melodramatic storytelling hits the mark (Thandie Newton's performance), it misses at least as often (Whoopi Goldberg's).
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> Perry uses a very heavy hand to create melodrama when the material is dramatic enough.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> Loopy, ill-paced, but often endearing, For Colored Girls owes everything to its powerhouse stable of actresses who manage to grab at the heart of Shange's words and lift the film past its flaws.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> It's better to reach for the stars and not always succeed than to lazily play it safe, and For Colored Girls is nothing if not courageous.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> Shows a mastery of tone, a capacity to elicit strong performances and also to bring out different colors within those performances so that, when it all comes together, it's not the same note sounding over and over. This is smart, lovely work.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.65 <###> Perry's ambition in translating the work to the screen is determined and true; the film's main fascination is that of watching a director struggle to honor Shange's choreopoem and then lose the battle not with the material but with himself.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> The writer/director behind the exceedingly broad comedy of the Madea franchise approaches the hit 1970s Ntozake Shange play with a pragmatism that succeeds in form but not in function.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> Fans of the original may be dismayed by his often-awkward adaptation, which turns too many of Shange's survivors into victims. But it's equally likely that his blunt, emotional approach -- using her words to create his own melodrama -- will connect ...
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.375 <###> Monologues and melodrama rarely work in contemporary movies exploring social ills.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.7 <###> It is a film destined to polarize. Many will hate it. Hopefully more will love it, or at least allow room for it, for its raw brutality, its extremes, its difficult truths.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> By casting a raft of magnetic actresses and focusing his work around their talents, Perry gives his film a power beyond the melodramatic twists and flat-footed dialogue.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> Who could imagine, 35 years on, For Colored Girls would become a star-studded mess of a movie directed by a black, male Hollywood mogul?
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> Shange gives us archetypes; Perry trades in stereotypes.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> For Colored Girls raises the question of whether Perry, having made more money than he could possibly spend, will now turn his attention to ever more challenging, if not so popular, stories and themes. If so, this film is a good first step.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> The audience I saw it with didn't seem to know whether to clap when it was over or start taking Lipitor.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.0 <###> I used to think there was nothing worse in modern moviemaking than Perry's unfunny, incompetent stooping for profit. It turns out that when he boldly and blatantly panders for prestige, he reaches even newer lows.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> daring, provocative, and a little arrogant
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.375 <###> The appeal of the original went far beyond the specifics of being black or female, in the '70s or any time. The adaptation's limitations make the play seem quaint, out of date.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.25 <###> Perry has built a lucrative and beloved niche from films aimed specifically at black women, but none of those pictures bore the painfully theatrical artifice of For Colored Girls...
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> Perry tries to be faithful to the play and also to his own boldly and simply told stories, and the two styles don't fit together.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.4 <###> The centerpiece tragedy ... is so incompetently and appallingly staged that the film literally jumps the shark before your eyes -- no recovery is possible.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.2 <###> Perry has taken a groundbreaking, radical work of theater and turned it into just another cardboard Tyler Perry movie.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> The film comes off as one long litany of lament and tragedy that never fits together.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.375 <###> [Perry has] made what amounts to a tone-deaf musical of women's hardships, one where stereotypes soliloquize rather than sing.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> Herein lies an invitation for us all to move beyond victimhood ... and, in some cases, simply to get over ourselves.
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.875 <###> All that was missing was a pistol-packing granny in drag, chirrun!
770860166 <###> For Colored Girls <###> Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.375 <###> For Colored Girls's undiluted hysteria would be completely obscene if it weren't so unintentionally hilarious.
9922 <###> Ride in the Whirlwind <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Classics <###> 0.7 <###> There's a pervasive feeling of hopelessness to Ride In The Whirlwind that points the way to later gloomy counterculture favorites like Bonnie And Clyde.

19266 <###> Promises <###> Documentary;Drama;Special Interest <###> 0.875 <###> If there's one big point to Promises, it's that nothing can change while physical and psychological barriers keep the sides from speaking even one word to each other.

398053947 <###> The Abandoned <###> Horror <###> 0.7 <###> At its best, it's an effective shocker with an atmosphere that seeps into your very bones. The problem is it's not always at its best, and when it isn't, it really isn't.

647845018 <###> Black Sheep <###> Horror;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Shaun of the Dead has set the bar pretty high for this sort of thing; Black Sheep just isn't nearly as funny or suspenseful.

462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Given his built-in appeal, Perry has the opportunity to broaden the subject matter of so-called black movies. He takes a stab at it in Girls, but he could do so much better.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The script isn't much better than Perry's Madea's Family Reunion... but it helps that Perry doesn't show up in the crass, cross-dressing role of Madea and that he has hired some excellent actors.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> This particular Tyler Perry movie offers some glimpses of the graceful comic talent its one-man entertainment empire can be if he turns down the volume more often.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> In terms of direction, this is the sharpest film Perry has made. It moves at a deft pace, and the comedic sequences continually score. He also knows how to create a mood.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> In Daddy's Little Girls, Tyler Perry merits an A for the messages he wants to deliver but only a C-plus for the way he delivers them.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Perry will never get an Oscar nomination, but he has something better: an audience.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> [Union and Elba] are such expressive, extremely thoughtful performers. They have chemistry and they have class. What they don't have is a filmmaker who knows yet how to use either to make real movie magic. I'm rooting for him to figure it out.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There are fewer laughs and more lectures... but there's plenty of sass and soul in between.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Daddy's Little Girls is maudlin and manipulative, but compared to movies with awful stereotypes like Norbit, is that such a bad thing?
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Don't let the brightly colored poster with the cute little girls on it fool you -- this isn't a comedy, either, but is meant to be a drama with a message. Daddy's Little Girls has its funny moments, but overall it's fairly somber from the start.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Daddy's Little Girls is a serviceable dramedy that's slightly outlandish but nevertheless strives to touch the heart with its well-intentioned vibes.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It is exciting to think that someone in Perry's position is indeed challenging himself, as he could presumably coast along on tried-and-true formulas for quite some time.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Regardless of how silly the storyline becomes, Perry's admiration for single dads who take care of their kids and people who take their faith and their families seriously comes through...
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> [Perry's] gotten comfortable behind the camera. And without Madea, his obese, smart-mouthed alter-ego auntie, to portray, the man in the dress shows he really can direct.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Kindness, graciousness, nurturing, and support is the message for couples and community, so even if it's not saying anything new under the sun, all that syrup makes the cardboard taste better.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Suffice to say that everybody in this totally TV-tempered, finger-waggingly reactionary movie learns a valuable lesson in getting back to basics.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Daddy's Little Girls is the kind of movie where you look the other way as regards to minor offences, so devoted is it to making a positive statement.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Daddy's Little Girls is [Perry's] best-looking film to date. Is it asking too much for a script to match?
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.45 <###> There'll always be a place for Perry in a world where there are moviegoers who find Spike Lee's films too challenging.
462957579 <###> Daddy's Little Girls <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Almost a real movie.
19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> Horror movies today rely on gore and as many jump out of your seat moments as they can throw at you. This one relies on old fashioned atmosphere and acting ability and that's all it really needs.
19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> This Universal classic not only established Lon Chaney Jr as a horror star but also instigated most of the cinematic werewolf lore concerning pentagrams, the Moon and the fatality of silver.
19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Even with a canon that includes the definitive versions of (among others) Frankenstein, Dracula and The Phantom of the Opera, this 1941 classic has always remained my favorite of the studio's prolific output.
19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Most horrifying is the potential inability to sway our own innately darker tendencies.
19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Chaney may appear to have had a bad run-in with a hair dryer, but he's still the definitive villain as tragic hero.
19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> A film of sometimes uncertain greatness that is nonetheless the most entertaining and effective Universal monster movie since Bride of Frankenstein.

19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> In spite of its age, the emotional impact, and sheer terror hasn't lost its punch with great performances, and a tragic ending.
19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> It's a good, solid film, held together by Chaney's appealing performance and great supporting players like Lugosi as Bela the gypsy who turns into a wolf.
19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Charming & fun 40's monster schlock.
19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> It's not as boring as Dracula, but not nearly as inventive as, say, Bride of Frankenstein.
19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> A wonderfully campy horror film that made a star of Lon Chaney Jr. Despite its hokiness, it stills holds up.
19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Apesar de ter se transformado em um personagem tragico e fascinante nos filmes posteriores da serie (com seu constante desejo de morrer), Larry Talbot e apenas um monstro convencional e nada interessante neste primeiro capitulo.
19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Bad moon rising.
19319 <###> The Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Classic horror with somewhat misused cast

771355938 <###> My Sweet Pepper Land <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> An amusing, touching and subtly transportive film set in a place you'll probably never get to visit.
771355938 <###> My Sweet Pepper Land <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> A solid foreign twist on gunslingers and damsels in distress
771355938 <###> My Sweet Pepper Land <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> As well as being another contemporary example of gutsy, engrossing drama coming from foreign filmmakers, it is also telling that we have to look to foreign language films such as this and Wadjda for female characters worth a damn.
771355938 <###> My Sweet Pepper Land <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> If you get right down to it Baran represents the new sheriff attempting to bring law and order to an unruly and violent town while dallying with the local schoolmistress. The result is a film of great cultural interest plus suspense and humour.
771355938 <###> My Sweet Pepper Land <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> One of the notable achievements Saleem's quietly surprising film is a combination of off-beat comedy and a strong sense of menace and danger.
771355938 <###> My Sweet Pepper Land <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Admittedly, the denouement is slightly off the pace and it all fades to an anticlimax, but wide blue skies, craggy bluffs and sure-footed mountain ponies are all put to good use.
771355938 <###> My Sweet Pepper Land <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Director Hiner Saleem takes the trappings of an old-school American Western, and infuses them with a distinctively Kurdish feel.
771355938 <###> My Sweet Pepper Land <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> The film's outcome may be predictable, and its framework decidedly retro, but the themes are anything but, including a healthy dose of feminism.
771355938 <###> My Sweet Pepper Land <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The lead actors have chemistry, and with Baran's hazel eyes and Govend's high cheek bones, what else do you need?
771355938 <###> My Sweet Pepper Land <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.74 <###> An interesting blend of classic cinema tropes set in the extremely specific (and rarely discussed) liberated Kurdistan.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.375 <###> ...a little needless brutality would've almost certainly elevated the proceedings, albeit temporarily...

128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> - Aspirante a Terror em Silent Hill (jogo e filme) que, repleto de cliches e personagens caricaturais, revela-se apenas cansativo e previsivel.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> ...if the filmmakers could have dispensed with the actors and plot altogether, they might have had a better movie.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.2 <###> Never has a title been more horribly at odds with the way you're actually going to feel while watching the movie.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.2 <###> A cool idea rapidly falls apart. A completely missed opportunity.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> Something of a disappointment and nowhere near as scary as The Ring, which it rips off shamelessly.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.2 <###> Stuttering like a busted console, the film's lack of invention is only rivalled by a paucity of gore which will seem positively comical to gamers long since inured to cyberspace slaughter.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> A lack of logic infects this film like a virus.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.2 <###> The dialogue seldom rises above the level of twaddle -- unspeakable in every sense of the word.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.0 <###> The filmmakers are so at a loss for fresh ways to shock that they even dredge up the twitchy, girl-with-hair-hanging-in-her-face trick from The Ring and The Grudge.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.2 <###> Never mind staying alive. You'd be doing well to simply stay awake through all 85 interminably inert minutes of Stay Alive.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.0 <###> Implausibly tedious, Stay Alive has none of the vicarious thrills of, say, Konami's Silent Hill 2. It's barely even Pong unplugged.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.375 <###> The bloody 16th Century saga of Hungary's Countess Elizabeth Bathory is transported to pre-Katrina New Orleans in this occasionally spooky but cheap and inconsequential thriller.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.06 <###> Boring!!!
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.3 <###> Seriously, Bell, answer me something: does the game kill you when you die on the game? Does the game kill you because you have it in your possession? Or does the game kill you period because you played it? Which is it?
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.2 <###> Since the director and co-writer William Brent Bell does little to contrast the contrived and mechanical horror of the game with the mounting horror of the story, we can't invest much sympathy in the plight of the characters.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> A typical offering in the PG-13 horror-movie genre, "Stay Alive" won't surprise anybody, especially the young demographic toward which it is aimed.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.6 <###> Really silly, but there's nothing inherently unlikable about the movie's silliness.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.25 <###> It's unlikely that Stay Alive could ever have been a good movie in the traditional sense, but it might have been better if Bell and co-writer Matthew Peterman had done more to exploit their gaming premise.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> It's too tame to be scary and too silly to take seriously. What it does seriously is waste time, which is fine if you really don't have anything better to do, like, say, count cracks in the sidewalk.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.2 <###> Perhaps the worst horror film to not have Uwe Boll's name in the credits.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.2 <###> The star of Stay Alive is a cutting-edge video game, but the film still has hackneyed horror at its heart.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.3 <###> This movie will bore you to death
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.125 <###> A notion of an outline of a rough draft of a killer video-game flick.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.375 <###> There's a fascinating and terrifying story to be told about Elizabeth Bathory, the dramatically depraved 17th century sadist known as the Blood Countess. This ain't it.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.375 <###> Here's a movie that tries to be a video game but is less entertaining than a vending machine.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.375 <###> The hybrid of cyber antics and bayou creepiness doesn't quite jell, but it all ends bloodily, and in an efficient 85 minutes, too. I'm not complaining.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> With all the gamer product endorsements (Alienware, PS2), you'd think they could afford someone to write a better ending for a decent idea.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.3 <###> makes minimal sense, displays minimal style, and provides minimal entertainment
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.125 <###> A complete cinematic joke.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.7 <###> While the plot device is quite innovative, the execution remains pretty true to the PG-13 thriller formula.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.5 <###> The movie equivalent of junk food: It's not good, but it's predictable and even satisfying, in a low-expectations way.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.25 <###> Dead on arrival.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.25 <###> What will terrify the audience very early on is the realization that there's better acting in the video game than on the big screen.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.25 <###> It's amazing how little Stay Alive actually knows about the videogame culture in which its terror-lite tale is set.
128388213 <###> Stay Alive <###> Mystery & Suspense;Horror <###> 0.6 <###> Stay Alive isn't a total wash if you're looking to kill a Saturday afternoon or night if you get off on hearing little kids scream.
11676 <###> Rocky II <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Although Rocky II builds itself around a rematch between Rocky and Apollo, the movie is anything but a lazy sequel.
11676 <###> Rocky II <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Sly sequel is as predictable as a gym workout.
11676 <###> Rocky II <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Pretty good sequel, among several that followed, this time directed by Stallone.
11676 <###> Rocky II <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> Considerably less satisfying than the original Rocky, but head and shoulders above the later installments.
11676 <###> Rocky II <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> ...can't help but come off as the most needless installment of the bunch...
11676 <###> Rocky II <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> "Rocky II" represents far more than just a good-looking fight. It's all about trusting in yourself and overcoming fear in striving for greatness.
11676 <###> Rocky II <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Rocky II has a waxy feeling, and it never comes to life the way its predecessor did.
11676 <###> Rocky II <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> The best of the sequels. Explores the aftermath of Rocky's success.
11676 <###> Rocky II <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> While cruder than the first film, Rocky II successfully drives its hero back to the underdog status needed to make the final fight as exciting and satisfying as it is.

13308 <###> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly <###> Western <###> 1.0 <###> The uncut new print reclaims the widescreen majesty of Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography, allowing you to see every iconic wart and furrow on every bad guy's face.
13308 <###> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly <###> Western <###> 1.0 <###> [Leone] weighs every movement carefully; every footstep, every squeeze of the trigger, screams epic. Everything is important and nothing is insignificant.
13308 <###> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly <###> Western <###> 1.0 <###> The most ambitious of Eastwood's collaborations with Leone
13308 <###> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly <###> Western <###> 1.0 <###> May lose some of its jolt on the small screen, but this flick features some of Clint Eastwood's and Sergio Leone's finest moments.
13308 <###> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly <###> Western <###> 0.9 <###> Both epic and intimate: The sun-baked panoramas of the West (actually Spain) and the gigantic battles of North against South have a counterpoint in the dramas that play out between the three men.
13308 <###> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly <###> Western <###> 1.0 <###> Sergio Leone sure is a great director. He has a unique visual style, combining gorgeous establishing shots of Western landscape and tense close-ups.
13308 <###> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly <###> Western <###> 0.8 <###> The movie that solidified Eastwood's iconography. Leone's dazzling Techniscope cinematics far surpass the familiar plot.
13308 <###> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly <###> Western <###> 1.0 <###> Pure spaghetti western perfection.
13308 <###> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly <###> Western <###> 1.0 <###> Morricone's soundtrack is one the most powerful in the history cinema and it alone is the reason why this film should be so highly appreciated.
13308 <###> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly <###> Western <###> 1.0 <###> The film runs about two hours and forty-five minutes, but is absolutely absorbing, and goes by quickly and smoothly.
266544717 <###> L' Appartement (The Apartment) <###> Drama;Romance;Art House & International;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> ...at least this version isn't saddled with a lead performance from the notoriously stiff Josh Hartnett.

9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> Can't compete with Disney classics, but still fun.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.4 <###> Quite insipid and wretchedly unengaging.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.375 <###> The computer-assisted animation is relatively stiff and inexpressive.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.4 <###> Lacks the classic Disney charm that works for adults as well as kids
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> The animation is clumsy, the songs are forgettable, the attempts at late-80s relevance now come across as dated and slightly embarrassing.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.375 <###> I guess I can cut the Mouse House a little slack when it comes to paint-by-numbers mediocrities like Oliver & Company.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.66 <###> More notable for what it isn't than what it is, it's one of the gangly middle children of the Disney animation family, not quite sure how to fit in, or even if it's valued.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Animated Dickens makes for a surprisingly successful translation, and in my book Billy Joel can do very little wrong.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> Cute but forgettable cartoon musical; a solid voice cast does a decent job.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> ...the virtual nadir of the Disney oeuvre.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> Simply put, Oliver & Company didn't work for me not because I'm many years past my sixth birthday but because it never scared me into forgetting that fact.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> "catchy songs, a cuddly hero, perfectly pleasant"
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> The film offers a fanciful, lush urban setting, unusual for Disney animated features, and a couple of good songs.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> Mostly harmless.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.25 <###> Seen today, Oliver & Company comes across as a rather shabby transitional work, one that lacks the sophistication of today's 'toons and doesn't hold up to the Disney classics of yesteryear.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.625 <###> Despite three screenwriters and 13 names credited for the story, the script quickly sinks into a predictable 'girl-meets-pet, girl-loses-pet, girl-and -pet-reunite' sap-trap.
9542 <###> Oliver & Company <###> Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.375 <###> Why these juvenile delinquents and their even worse masters are considered appropriate material for the 3-8 set that is most likely to see this movie is a conundrum.
9540 <###> The Parent Trap <###> Kids & Family;Romance;Classics;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Hayley Mills rocks in her dual role as twins.
9540 <###> The Parent Trap <###> Kids & Family;Romance;Classics;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> An enjoyable, corny Disney picture with a memorable soundtrack featuring tunes sung by Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello.
9540 <###> The Parent Trap <###> Kids & Family;Romance;Classics;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> ...irrelevant and dated...
9540 <###> The Parent Trap <###> Kids & Family;Romance;Classics;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Easily one of the best Disney live-action films, with Mills shining in a dual role.
9540 <###> The Parent Trap <###> Kids & Family;Romance;Classics;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Pretty good family film. Helps that Hayley Mills was my first crush, when I was 10 years old.

770728293 <###> 14 Days in Paradise <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Intended as a farcical tale of love in a tropical locale, 14 Days in Paradise is far too sloppily conceived and executed to do more than strain viewers' patience.
14826 <###> Thick As Thieves <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> One of those self-consciously quirky crime films that feel more dated as each passing second brings the film world farther away from Pulp Fiction.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> (500) Days is a funny, seductive, and surprisingly honest dramatization of the ways we snooker ourselves into incompatible love.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> It manages to deliver a love story that gets you invested even though you know it can't end neatly with either happiness or tragedy, but rather with a bittersweet mishmash of imperfection -- one that that everybody can probably relate to.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Inventive, original and hugely relatable, (500) Days Of Summer is the perfect screen deconstruction of a relationship, for once, from the man's point of view.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Tom and Summer may not be the most emotionally stable people on the planet, and if they were my friends, I'd have little sympathy for them.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Movies like this are the reason why I love movies.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> As Summer, Zooey Deschanel is an enchanting, blue-eyed mixture of nearness and distance. You can see why Tom loves her, even as she stomps on his heart.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> You've seen this movie before (just usually with a fakey big-kiss ending; extra points here for the blunt honesty about breakups) but this one is just right for Right Now.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> (500) Days of Summer is as close to perfect as a movie gets. A highly subjective claim? Sure, but so are all movie reviews, and this is hardly the time to get into that argument.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Zany visuals and spirited performances makes 500 Days of Summer an entertaining chronicle of the making and breaking of a modern secular relationship.

770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> We have been trained by Hollywood to react a certain way to a certain kind of movie and 500 Days of Summer seeks to un-train us through shock therapy.

770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> At last, here's a movie that takes the wimpy, tortured, hopelessly-in-love boys from the other movies and tells them to grow up.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Le tout est execute avec un tel enthousiasme que nous ne pouvons que nous laisser emporter par cette vague on ne peut plus rafraichissante, et surtout profondement desarmante.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> a nicely played but all-too-preciously eccentric romance
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> (500) Days of Summer is a classic independent film, taking a bunch of risks and trying to break as many rules as possible, yet it is in many ways a traditional ode to love, and it will leave you yearning for the opportunity to be dumped yourself.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Despite the tricky punctuation, (500) Days of Summer might be the most truthful rom-com about the sort of people you're likely to know; not inhabitants of some movie version of Fairyland.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Heartbreak is rarely enjoyable, but in this case, it's very easy company -- as are Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Tom is a prime example of what happens when you grow up listening to too much sad British pop music: unrealistic expectations for romantic love and a taste for skinny ties and sweater vests. Now he's fallen, and fallen hard, for Summer. How could he not?
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Too timid to be truly cynical about love and too eager for box-office success to try to be a really new kind of romantic comedy, the film fails the ultimate romantic-comedy test: not only does it lack enough laughs, but you're never emotionally involved.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Director Marc Webb's debut feature is as far from a Sandra Bullock or Hugh Grant vehicle as you can imagine. What better reason to go see it? From start to end his subtle movie feather-teases your funny spots: it amazes, refreshes and it delights.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Perfectly played, simultaneously serious and light, endlessly inventive, this is a strong contender for the most original date movie of the year. (Terrific) stuff.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> If it just misses being this generation's 'Annie Hall', it's still deliciously refreshing, sweet and fizzy. A sherbet dip of a movie.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It is hardly the freshest romantic comedy of the past 20 years. Taking the best bits from other movies and rearranging them in a non-linear sequence does not make for an original film.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Despite clever moments and Hornbyesque touches of melancholy, it's let down by sitcom cliches, and by being weirdly incurious about the inner life of its female lead.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> An ideal version of this film would be painful and playful, and a good deal less cluttered. But the one we get certainly has delightful moments. After any exposure to this year's unfailingly smelly mainstream romcoms, it's a breeze.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> (500) Days of Summer is a great film - a step in genre and gender development that will be referenced for years to come. And aside from all that, it's really good fun.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> An endorphin rush of a movie, which even in its saddest moments is uplifting funny.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A clever, refreshing, non-formulaic antidote to your average, bog-standard Hollywood romcom.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Unabashedly indie heartstring-yanker 500 Days of Summer- while mercifully rejecting the rom-com template - is less than the sum of its well-played parts.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A playful, witty, disordered telling of a fractured romance. Bringing fresh zing to a genre prone to predictability, Webb crafts a (not-in-) love story about feeling bad that's infectiously good.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> There is more cinematic joy in five minutes of (500) Days of Summer than there is in a packed weekend of mainstream romance movies.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A sharp spin on the usual rom-com formulae, this is funny, sensitive and challenges the genre's gender conventions.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> By a wide margin the outstanding romantic comedy of 2009.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> An energetic, enjoyable affair with plenty to say about unrequited love.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> A modern romance for grown-ups... a sweet-natured, funny, deeply-romantic tale that brims with energy and is blessed with top-notch performances.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> (500) Days of Summer is an above average rom-com that dares to venture towards an appalling conclusion.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> I've read somewhere that (500) Days of Summer is being called the Annie Hall de nos jours; that's a slur on a great movie, not to say on nos jours.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Comparisons with Woody Allen are misplaced - the lines don't punch the way Woody's used to - but the cinematography does a good job of making unfashionable corners of Los Angeles look like Allen's Manhattan.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> A charming, funny and wonderfully inventive romcom that's easily one of the best films of the year.

770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> It comes replete with all the try-hard affectations of the whimsical American indie film - a third-person narrator, quirky animated title cards, an obligatory shout out to Belle & Sebastian - but manages to transcend its influences enough to appear fresh.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> In a cinema season overflowing with ho-hum rom-coms , it's a delight to come across one that moves off the well-beaten track and entertains at the same time.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> I loved (500) Days of Summer for many reasons, but for this one the most: I felt more during this movie than I have in any other romantic comedy in years.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> exceeds its whimsical indie-film touches because it is rooted in the kinds of recognizable truths that give weight to what would otherwise be simply amusing

770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Told in brilliantly written non-linear clumps, it is more of a falling-out-of-love story than a traditional tale of boy-meets-girl, they struggle but live happily ever after.

770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> There she goes, a chestnut mare who can't be lassoed, an elusive butterfly traveling to the beat of a different drum.
770801801 <###> 500 Days of Summer <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The lead male character is shy and even gentlemanly, which is not just a novelty but a relief in this Age of Apatow.

2864413 <###> Grandma's Boy <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> The chief value of this stinker is as a glimpse of how bad Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle and The 40-Year-Old Virgin might have been if they'd been written by Covert, Barry Wernick and Nick Swardson, and directed by Nicholaus Goossen.
2864413 <###> Grandma's Boy <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Covert is so obnoxious, so lacking in the basic understanding of comic timing, that we understand why he has to get his buddy Sandler to give him work.

2864413 <###> Grandma's Boy <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It's gross, it's cheesy, and it's baked beyond all reasonable limits, but this everything-and-the-kitchen-sink comic souffle still manages to be goofily entertaining beyond all expectations.
2864413 <###> Grandma's Boy <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> "Grandma's Boy" is a pot- and potty-mouthed relative of an Adam Sandler movie.

2864413 <###> Grandma's Boy <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's plenty stupid, often funny and occasionally pithy. That may add up to a movie you want to see, or it might add up to a movie that will make you ill.
2864413 <###> Grandma's Boy <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Sufficiently oddball and the performers sufficiently likable to keep the whole thing from being painful.

2864413 <###> Grandma's Boy <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> While '06 is still young, chances are, 12 months from now, Grandma's Boy will rank as one of the year's worst comedies. Munich offers more laughs.

2864413 <###> Grandma's Boy <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> I won't even bore you with the horrendous way this project was shot, cut, or scrawled with crayon onto a roll of toilet paper. This thing makes the Police Academy movies look like the collected works of Billy Wilder.

2864413 <###> Grandma's Boy <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> This is one of those movies where you stay rooted in your seat just to see how bad it can really get. And every time you think it has hit the bottom, the filmmakers find a passage taking them lower.

2864413 <###> Grandma's Boy <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Just as a few bong hits would probably make the movie a tiny bit funnier, they would also probably make all memories of the film blissfully vanish.
2864413 <###> Grandma's Boy <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> It's a miracle that Jones, Knight and Roberts emerge with most of their dignity intact. Too bad the same can't be said for everyone else involved in this total waste of time.

377650642 <###> The War Within <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> You just can't believe Hassan can see so much innocent humanity and still choose mass murder. And then Hassan quietly intones "God is great," and you realize he can no longer see them at all.

377650642 <###> The War Within <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The picture couldn't be more topical, but in the end it feels schematic, and you sense that the filmmakers are trying too hard to be even-handed.

377650642 <###> The War Within <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> This is the sort of material guaranteed to disquiet anyone who lived through 9/11, but rather than exploiting the memories for easy genre thrills, director Joseph Castelo tries to confront the underlying situation.
377650642 <###> The War Within <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.875 <###> In a brisk 100 minutes, we get to know the conflicted, but driven Hassan so clearly, intimately and, most of all, humanly, that you have to keep remembering not to root for him to succeed in his quest for death and destruction.
377650642 <###> The War Within <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Of all the feature films and documentaries to emerge since 9/11, few have been as bold, perceptive or as downright chilling as this thriller from co-writer/director Joseph Castelo.

377650642 <###> The War Within <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A movie about a sympathetic suicide bomber in New York? Producer Mark Cuban would probably bankroll a movie about a sympathetic Nazi in 1944.

753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> There is no wisdom or critical acumen in evidence in Shoot 'Em Up, however. Just 100 or so cool scenes masquerading as a movie.

753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> With its absurd anti-gun "message," the film certainly could be called a satire, yet it remains firmly within the genre it is satirizing.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Ridiculously violent, comically bloody and so over-the-top that one can only view it as a cartoon that just so happens to be live-action. As for the says-it-all title, it is truth in advertising taken to the extreme.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> For sheer audacity and adrenaline-fueled carnage, Shoot 'Em Up hits its target pretty much dead on.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> For those who can stand the nonstop assault on their sensibilities, it's delightfully trashy, albeit irresponsible.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> Really, this thing is pretty rank.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> The most amoral action film since Crank.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Everything about this neo-noir version of an Itchy & Scratchy marathon is casually ludicrous, right down to its back-handed advocacy of - wait for it - gun control.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> Seems in pursuit of being the ultimate 'guy movie,' but fans of this sort of glamorized killing spree aren't the kind of guy that most guys want to be.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> A vulgar, smug and willfully stupid movie that's both a lazy pseudo-parody of action films and a particularly egregious example of the genre itself.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> Not one second of the film is anything other than ludicrous, which is exactly why it rocks.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> If you're impressed by the way Owen takes out bad guys while holding an infant, wait until you see how he manages mid-climax (yes, I mean that sort of climax).
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> This hyperkinetic, ultra-violent, guns-a-blazin' actioner from writer-director Michael Davis can be accused of many things - stupidity, misogyny, the death of American film as we know it - but false advertising is not one of them.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Drinking the full adrenaline-with-a-wink cocktail might be too much, but there's nothing wrong with sampling it.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> a high-impact, adrenaline pumping, laugh-out-loud film that is so preposterously over the top that it is almost poetry
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> This wet dream for action junkies leaves out logic and motivation -- you know, all the boring stuff.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Getting worked up over Shoot 'Em Up's excessive bloodshed is playing right into its hands.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Casts aside some of the sillier macho cliches of the genre for an over-the-top action flick full of dark humor and cartoon violence.
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.68 <###> The biggest problem I have with a spoof of action/ carnage/ car chase/ gunfire movies is that this genre is a spoof of real life to begin with. What's with spoofing a spoof?
753391596 <###> Shoot 'Em Up <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Not only riffing on John Woo's Hong Kong flicks but cranking up the action until it becomes quite literally a madcap cartoon.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Emphatically weird, watchable and niche.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> It's hard to see what, if anything, Lanthimos is saying about modern Greece. And without that clear focus, the film feels a bit off-piste.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> From the Greek filmmakers behind the acclaimed anti-thriller Dogtooth, this fiendishly inventive drama is just as complex and telling.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.4 <###> Lanthimos is such a distinctive film-maker and nothing he does is without interest - but this is a misfire.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> The movie's morbidly funny once you get the hang of it, and climaxes deftly, but for too long Lanthimos feels like he's stalling for no especial purpose.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Requires multiple viewings to pick this one apart.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> The reality it takes place in is heightened just enough to make the concept feel ironic, but then all attempt at genuine sentiment subsequently falls flat.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Lanthimos delivers another heady dose of weirdness. Loopier than a frog sandwich but rather wonderful.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> Absurdly amusing (in places), rigorously directed, and more interesting on an intellectual level than an emotional one.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> An hour and a half of darkening absurdism.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> Helps make the case that Lanthimos might be a worthy, more entomological successor to Luis Bunuel.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> The film takes some deciphering, but once a viewer cracks its code "Alps" opens up into something expansive and rich.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> Lanthimos' vision still compels and challenges, but Alps offers a big idea in place of a better movie.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> A film peculiar beyond all understanding, based on a premise that begs belief.

771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> A strange story. A strange world. And strange characters doing even stranger things.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.7 <###> This cinematic experience was weirdly fascinating.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> Lanthimos continually keeps you guessing about both the procedural and emotional logic at work in "Alps," and his actors are with him every step of the way.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> The tone is one of deadpan discombobulation, a world turned 45 degrees to the left but presented with a clear, dry perspective.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.875 <###> The movie focuses tightly and obviously on role playing, but the most unsettling observations concern how fragile it all is - our health, our minds, our denial of death.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> Oblique connections are the threads that hold this film together, as Mr. Lanthimos moves from one somber, deliberate scene to the next.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Puzzling and provocative, Alps has a lingering power and an effect that is thrillingly difficult to define.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.875 <###> Both a companion piece to and in many ways a reversal of Dogtooth, it builds on that film's surreally terse style and notions of communication and identity without diluting its singularity or concentration
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> Lanthimos' film, with its emphasis on death deferred, holds the chilly fascination of a gaping skull.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> ALPS is a real mind trip with strong acting, and it leaves you to wonder what Lanthimos and Filippou will do next.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Feels very much like a companion piece to Dogtooth; albeit a subtler, less confronting, and also less powerful one. How could it possibly compare? But Alps does have one trump card; a profoundly sad beating heart.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> The premise is fetching and feels like a mystery, particularly as the film orchestrates its story to make the work of the Alps group seem like a kind of heist.
771244503 <###> Alps <###> Documentary;Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> An overly elaborate riddle

771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Once blood starts spurting and the old pros take control of the show, Patino's clever plotting wins viewers over.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Quite apart from the equally apparent lack of the Coens's extraordinary visual acuity, Cut Bank comes up short because it simply presumes that guilt and evil already live in town, just waiting for us to arrive and see the show.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> This is one script that no doubt read a lot better than it was ever going to look or sound.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Deficient in charisma, Hemsworth lacks both the grit and grin that his complicated role demands.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> In this sort of film, plenty of characters hope to get out of their small-time town, while viewers hope to get out of the theater.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> Like many of its brethren, the movie seems to love itself while hating its characters.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> It could have been so much more, and maybe that's its greatest flaw.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Just a generic exercise in pulp fiction.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> While there's some undeniably inherent joy in just seeing some of these great actors play off each other, the sum here is a shockingly dull affair, almost made more disappointing by the talent it wastes.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Predictable thriller has lots of violence, some swearing.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Violent and on-the-edge of funny, "Fargo Lite," right up to the end, where the wheels come off.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> This Bizarro-universe Coen brothers mash-up has the decency to be sporadically fun, even when it isn't especially original or steady.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> Cut Bank is well told with a different twist.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> If the film is meant only as a pulpy genre exercise, Matt Shakman's competence in various modes actually works to strip it of any sense of coherent vision.
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Generic yet entertaining...
771361096 <###> Cut Bank <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> If it be fated that every state eventually gets a Fargo knockoff to call its own, Montana will be disappointed that there's turned out to be as bloodless as Cut Bank.
19511 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance;Art House & International;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> This version of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, made A.G. (After Garbo), was not a success when it was first released, and it's still a failure now, but it's an often exquisitely sumptuous misfire, all the same.
19511 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance;Art House & International;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> Superb film version of the Tolstoy novel, with an extraordinary Vivien Leigh at the peak of her beauty and talent.
16315 <###> Ed Gein <###> Drama;Horror <###> 0.8 <###> Steve Railsback gives us probably the definitive cinematic Gein, and the movie is eminently worthwhile for him alone.
16315 <###> Ed Gein <###> Drama;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> Not really terrible, but way too dry and dull for any self-respecting serial killer biopic.
16315 <###> Ed Gein <###> Drama;Horror <###> 0.4 <###> Manages to make Ed Gein dull. An amazing feat.
770673390 <###> Emmanuelle <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Though it is more historically significant than any other softcore porno ever made, it just isn't that memorable an exploitation film.
770673390 <###> Emmanuelle <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> One of the classics of soft-core erotic cinema.
770673390 <###> Emmanuelle <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> It's a relief, during a time of cynicism in which sex is supposed to sell anything, to find a skin flick that's a lot better than it probably had to be.
770673390 <###> Emmanuelle <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> First time director Just Jaecklin's film is the movie that set the cliches for the soft core films to follow.
17315 <###> The Pink Panther <###> Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Funny and entertaining after all these years.
17315 <###> The Pink Panther <###> Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It is fun to look back and see how Peter Sellers completely stole the film from its bankable star, David Niven.
17315 <###> The Pink Panther <###> Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> All the ingredients for a great evening at the movies: lively music, eye-catching scenery, larger-than-life comic set pieces, suave men and beautiful women, and odd-man-out Clouseau, played to perfection by the one and only Peter Sellers. [Blu-ray]
17315 <###> The Pink Panther <###> Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> A good beginning
17315 <###> The Pink Panther <###> Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Hilarious no matter how many times you watch it. Slapstick for the sixties.

17315 <###> The Pink Panther <###> Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Wall-to-wall exposition courtesy of talking tuxedoes
17315 <###> The Pink Panther <###> Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Clouseau (Sellers) is...a character that must go down as one of the great comic creations in motion picture history.
17315 <###> The Pink Panther <###> Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The first in the series -- and strangely enough -- the least amusing.
17315 <###> The Pink Panther <###> Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Sure, it gave Sellers his classic role, but on its own, it's not that great
771412725 <###> Drake: Homecoming <###> Musical & Performing Arts;Special Interest <###> 0.2 <###> For fans of rap superstar Drake - and of bad editing, sloppy continuity and squandered opportunity.
771412725 <###> Drake: Homecoming <###> Musical & Performing Arts;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> There's little here for casual Drake listeners, but the film will definitely appeal to diehard fans.

494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Ultimately, a passable new Die Hard movie is more than anyone of us ever really expected, and that in itself is worth a jolly old Yippee-Ki-Ay.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Brainless? Sure. Entertaining? Yup.

494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.65 <###> Live Free or Die Hard needs a sense of joy, a sense that despite the harrowing nature of the situation, there is something entertaining - even to the participants - about the absurdity of the situation ... it doesn't have that.

494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> The Die Hard series was about as animated as Rocky's face until director Len Wiseman restored it to its kinetic essence...

494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> Live Free or Die Hard is as close as we are going to get to reliving the good old action films of the '80s.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> I was actually nervous with all the gunfire and near misses. But then it kept happening over and over again. So instead of being involved, I studied the action sequences.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> As more and more movies rely on massive CGI enhancement and Hong Kong choreographed wire-rigged fights, Die Hard revels in good, old-fashioned fist fights and real, immaculately executed stunts.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> An extremely proud throwback that has the basic decency to steal from the very best.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Esta cuarta entrega de la saga entrega todo lo que promete: accion, accion, sentido del humor y mas accion, con un Bruce Willis ideal en el papel que lo lanzo al estrellato.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> With an infectious laugh when he blows up the bad guys and the power to stay alive no matter what, Bruce Willis' John McClane is a welcome sight back in theaters.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> One of the surprises of the fourth instalment, apart from how good it is (who expected that?) is that the threat is internal.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> What's the fourth "Die Hard" called? I keep forgetting. "Die Hard: With a Pension"? "Die Hardened Arteries"? "Die Laughing"?
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Pure escapist fiction and has no relation to anything, which if you think about it, and you shouldn't, is perfectly fine.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> Now that this film is here, I'm going to need to see another "Die Hard" flick every three years or so until Willis dies. Hopefully by then they'll have perfected the art of replicating Willis as a Virtual Actotron 3001.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> As clueless about the original's appeal as the previous two follow-ups.

494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> You know how this is going to turn out, you just don't know what all is going to get blown up in the process... and it's still entertaining.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Action-packed, ridiculous and fun, here's another appearance by Bruce Willis as cop John McClane.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> ...Wiseman proves himself a master of on-screen excitement
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Duro de Matar 4.0 cumple con lo que promete: grandes dosis de accion, un heroe del pasado al que siempre es emocionante mirar y un argumento practicamente inexistente que sirve solo como sosten de las secuencias cargadas de adrenalina.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> More fireworks than any other film this summer. Bruce is back in the one role that fits him like a glove.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> It's peppered with thrilling computer-generated action, but there's still something endearingly old-fashioned about McClane and his bare-knuckled way of dealing with bad guys.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> This fourth episode of the Die Hard series, with its plot that seems to have come straight out of Marvel Comics and its preposterous if dynamic action sequences, has only a battered 52-year-old Bruce Willis as John McClane to commend it as a drama.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> At least I hope it's the last. Willis does OK for a middle-aged guy, but as another famous die-hard once said, a man's got to know his limitations.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> The most important thing is that director Len Wiseman stays true to the original formula. He could have gone for showy CGI or tried to be too self-referential. Instead, we get an uncomplicated plot, real stunts and a script which makes the most of Willis.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> For the most part, it's an enjoyable rollercoaster ride featuring lots and lots of explosions and some great special effects. Alas, it's not up there with the first three movies.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Older, balder. Better
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Given Wiseman's lack of style or guile, Die Hard 4.0 is pining for the freshness JJ Abrams pumped into M:I:3. Dopey story, so-so script and mostly ordinary action. It's the ever-enjoyable Willis that makes it worth your while.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Willis was entitled to one more kick-ass action outing. But please, let this be the last. Anything more would be dying soft.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> The aesthetic point might be elusive, but that's Bruce. Like this film, he has little time for detail.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> Chasing the ghosts of past glories in the name of product allegiance, Die Hard 4.0 clatters noisily down the lift shaft into oblivion.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> It's less yippe-kay-yay, more yippee-kay-maybe.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Yippee-ki-yay! Willis still has the goods. Credit to Wiseman, who keeps the thrills coming, and pass the popcorn.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.9 <###> At last! A real summer movie, the first real satisfying action blockbuster since 28 Weeks Later. (That was two months ago, for anyone keeping score.) It recaptures the gruff wit of the first, classic installment, while expanding upon the destructive insa
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> This attempt to resuscitate the Die Hard franchise, after the passage of 12 years and the remainder of Mr. Willis' hairline, is surprisingly effective.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> the dialogue and one-liners of Die Hard 4 are cheeky and clever, and it proves Bruce Willis still has his game against younger, faster kung-fu maniacs like Maggie Q
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> The type of ridiculously excessive adventure that summer moviegoing should be about.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes gang can only wish they could do some of the things John McClane executes so effortlessly here.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Live Free or Die Hard is surprisingly satisfying, largely because it is such an unapologetic throwback to pre-CGI mayhem.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> As a summer popcorn flick, Live Free or Die Hard delivers the goods.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> The rest of the movie can't keep up with its truly cracker-jack premise, turning it into a series of action sequences that might sound imaginative but play just as ludicrously as they sound.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> He's commenting on his own indestructibility, for sure, but he's commenting, too, on the burden of the convention that he be indestructible.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Far from the crass, just-for-the-money sequel it appeared to be on paper. It's a genuine blast.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Action movies don't get any more mindless than this, but sometimes mindlessness is fun too.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Even when Live Free or Die Hard is at its most outlandish, Willis gives the enterprise a humanist grounding.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> No pun intended, but I had a blast watching this film.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Willis' working-class hero gives the mayhem spunky soul and the human touch.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Bruce Willis is back in action to remind moviegoers that spandex-clad superheroes and swashbuckling pirates are no more heroic than a hardened cop.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Disappointingly generic...slips into last place in the series.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Send John McClane to Iraq. Even the title of 'Live Free or Die Hard' suggests that Bruce Willis' supercop is just the one-man troop surge the President needs to restore order to the world's No. 2 failed state.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> If you only see one film this summer, you need to get out more. But make this the one you choose.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> a pretty crummy comeback... (the) ridiculous stunts might have been dreamed up by a group of hyperactive 12-year-olds in the midst of a Red Bull binge; they should not have been staged by filmmakers old enough to know better.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> For a summer blockbuster, it delivers the goods. Just, please, no more Die Hard movies, okay?
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> The film moved at a clip, never bored me, offered an 'interesting' enough story-line for me to follow, and again, slam-dunked about half a dozen fun action sequences around the great McLane.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> The superlative action makes up for the glaring plot holes and limp dialogue.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Live Free is an homage to itself -- unpretentious, yet not campy -- a nostalgic and enjoyable thrill ride.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Feels like a throwback to the days of movies before computers, with actual cars blowing up and actual stunt men falling down shafts.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> I can safely say I've never seen anything as ridiculous as Live Free or Die Hard.

494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.9 <###> Bruce Willis is still a bada** and this series might not be dead yet...I'm just sayin'.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> Len Wiseman's movie charges hard and crunches bones with an old-school ethos of hellacious stunts and thrills. John McClane doesn't verbalize it as he has, but the yippie-ki-yay is alive in what will be hard to beat as 2007's best action film.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Live Free or Die Hard is positively entertaining.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> Four films in the franchise, all of them good. McClane has plenty of life left in him.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Live Free or Die Hard may be overblown and cartoonish, but it's also a helluva lot of fun and may become the surprise hit of the summer.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Live Free or Die Hard's goofy generation-gap gambit pays off decently and proves, again, that nattily dressed terrorists are no match for Willis, the once and future Patron Saint of Bang.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.67 <###> Makes the same sort of fool out of Bruce Willis today as 1960s and '70s old-style flag-waving did of John Wayne decades ago.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> Could a fifty-two year old guy like Willis still have that old magic? The answer is a resounding 'Yes!' ... Hey, sign me up. I'm ready for Die Hard 5, and the sooner, the better.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.9 <###> timely, terrifying, and terrifically entertaining
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> This is action at its most entertaining and proof that there is a lot of life left in this franchise.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Live Free or Die Hard may work better for an audience that doesn't know much about the series than it will for Die Hard die hards, who will be wondering who that impersonator is and what he did with the real John McClane.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Willis' star power and willingness to mix it up, along with thrilling action sequences, keep Live Free from collapsing into B-movie silliness.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> As spectacle goes, this is, ah, spectacular.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> This paradox comes with an attendant fallacy: that the best way to solve the static problem is to make the stunts even larger, the bangs even bigger. Wrong: More action just stops the film longer.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Live Free or Die Hard is indeed a worthy successor to the original -- not perhaps quite as good, but close.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> The post-9/11 techno-terrorist stuff works, the fights are creative and funny, and Willis is in top form in his career-defining role.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> If you think you've seen it all, you haven't. And what's best is that McClane/Willis enjoys it as much as we do. Yippee ki yay.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Sorry, boys. After two decades, the first film still does more with one skyscraper than Live Free or Die Hard does with an entire country.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> It's a total blast, an exercise in excess that defies logic and plausibility in a fearless effort to entertain.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> You can stop cringing at the idea of another Die Hard installment. Bruce Willis nails it in this fourth go-around...
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Like McClane himself, this is an analog movie in a digital world -- proudly outdated, yet guaranteed to get the job done.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Welcome to the new millennium John McClane, where the portions are huge but the quality isn't what it used to be.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> First, the good: it's f*cking Die Hard. John McClane is back and killing improbably large numbers of bad guys while causing extraordinary amounts of property damage.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Willis may be beyond what some consider an action star's prime. Yet like Clint Eastwood in the drama arena, he just keeps going out there and getting it done at a high level.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> What I love most about this, and movies that steal from it, is that plausibility is dispensed with early on, and there's never such thing as Too Much when it comes to piling on the threat or destroying property.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> [Willis] can handle it; he's in great shape for his age, plus he's been through this sort of thing many millions of dollars before.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> Give director Len Wiseman credit for making the ridiculous (some might say 'imaginative') retain some semblance of gravity.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> The third weak sequel in a creaky franchise that should have remained dormant.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Suspenseful and rousing and rarely stopping long enough to wear out its welcome. As crowd-pleasing spectacle, Live Free or Die Hard fits the bill.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Luckily it's not long before the not so technologically savvy McClane picks up a laptop and uses it to bash someone over the head.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Live Free or Die Hard is like the anti-Die Hard, a big, dumb cartoon that makes Bad Boys II seem restrained and realistic.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> Like every movie where they blow stuff up, just with some nostalgia thrown in. And so over the top and silly the movie borders on campy. Then, it blows right through the campy border with an 18-wheel semi truck.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> ...a pointless and thoroughly misguided sequel that tarnishes the series' overall effectiveness.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> More unpleasant than the notion that Matt's nationalism and manhood can only be validated with a gun, though, is the misogyny that creeps into Mark Bomback's script.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> That this implausible stew works as well as it does is in part a tribute to the unlikely but enjoyable rapport that forms between old school McClane and his youthful computer-savvy companion.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> [McClane] still has the same knack for trouble, the adrenaline-pumping, cheerfully anarchic kind that causes cars to ignite, bodies to fly, eardrums to pop and hearts to race and gladden.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> It's brainlessly exhilarating until the fighter-jet scene, at which point the high-octane idiocy becomes too preposterous to bear... and there's still a solid half hour to go.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> There's still some 'Yippe-ki-yay' left in this franchise.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> If your sense of the credible isn't awfully flexible, you're the wrong audience for movies like this. The nonsense bounces along at such a breathless clip that most viewers should willingly give the improbabilities a free pass.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Ultimately, Live Free or Die Hard so completely slacks our jaw and so successfully suspends our disbelief that the highest praise goes to the crew of first-class technicians who pulled it off.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> As implausible and over-the-top as certain elements are, this is the one big summer movie that's actually fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and it features so much action that you don't really have time to think about plot inconsistencies.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Live Free or Die Hard is the most creative and exciting Die Hard film since the original, though it's hardly the original's equal.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> The action in this fast-paced, hysterically overproduced and surprisingly entertaining film is as realistic as a Road Runner cartoon.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> This time the hype is real. The latest Die Hard film, the first in a dozen years, is the best in the series, an invigorating return to the style of blockbuster that dominated summers back in the early 1990s.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> Bruce, Justin, and the screenwriter's well-worked banter between the two, make all that action add up to a cohesive production that commandingly entertains.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Willis has a firm grip on what has made his character popular for nearly two decades, and maintains a firm hand on the wheel. Like almost everything he drives, he keeps the movie airborne. Yippee-ki-yay.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.9 <###> Step aside Captain Jack. Swing that web the other way, Spidey. You let us down, Silver Surfer. Yes, John McClane just kicked the $#%# out of all of ya'll. "Yippee Ki Yay Mo...!"
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Goofy fun.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> Live Free or Die Hard gets the action job done and you better believe that Bruce is still the man.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> It's the movie equivalent of a cop on the eve of retirement: he knows what he has to do, and he gets it done. But his heart isn't really in it anymore.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> It's a pulse-pounding, bad-guy-pummeling exercise in action excess, peppered with bad, bad dialogue.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.25 <###> If this is living free, you might consider pulling the plug.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Mostly, the flick relies on old-school stunt work rather than computer generated effects.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> This fourth installment in the franchise delivers when it comes to kick-butt, action-packed mayhem but bogs down focusing on key characters staring at computer screens, typing madly on keyboards or spouting techno-babble.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> There's no point in whining that Die Hard is mindless. That's like complaining about the sound of people eating popcorn in the theater.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> The usual pyrotechnics are intact, the corpses pile up and McClane even gets to spit out his signature battle cry.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> Director Len Wiseman never lets the movie slow down enough for us to think about what's happening. And he gives us some amusing things to keep us occupied, including one particularly fitting cameo.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> Just what we want from this franchise: social commentary!

494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> Marrying punishing action set-pieces to an unnerving disaster movie scenario, it grips the viewer with vice-like intensity, while never forgetting to revel in its own amiable absurdity.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> ...a throwback to a time when action movies were measured by the number of cars they crashed.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> A solid summer popcorn flick ... it successfully captures the feel of the Die Hard movies with a few cool modern-day twists.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> In this fourth film, there's a zip to the dialogue and a lift to the storytelling that recalls the spark of the original '88 Die Hard.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> As long as you understand that [LFODH] is nothing more or less than a three-ring festival of intricate stunts and pyrotechnic effects, punctuated with clown routines, you may not mind that it's about a half-hour longer than it needs to be.
494020502 <###> Live Free or Die Hard <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> It's efficient and entertaining, but even more preposterous than the first three films.

12794 <###> Divided We Fall <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> A provocative Holocaust drama saturated with tension and streaked with dark comedy.

12794 <###> Divided We Fall <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The cast ... performs with such subtlety and ingenuity that all sense of narrative artifice vanishes.
12794 <###> Divided We Fall <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It's both appallingly self-congratulatory and unconscionable.
12794 <###> Divided We Fall <###> Drama;Art House & International;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The settings are authentic, but the acting comes across fairly flat.
10330 <###> Don Juan DeMarco <###> Drama;Romance;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Iconoclastic acting by Marlon Brando, Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway elevate this likable comedy about love, illusion and delusion way above its inconsequential text.

351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> The movie's horrifying and beautiful conclusion becomes more poignant and powerful with each passing year.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> "Pandora's Box" is a German silent film that Paris Hilton could relate to. She wouldn't like the way it ends, though.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> Bold for its time, this restored, uncut version is a touch slow at some points, but its star glows throughout.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> Brooks overwhelms the lens with her magnetic eyes.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> If you've never seen Brooks -- or Pandora's Box -- you've missed one of the most extraordinary personalities and films of the silent movie era.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> Pabst was a psychologically astute filmmaker, but it's the shockingly sensual, charismatic Brooks that makes the picture.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> The movie remains one of the most insightful depictions of the elemental incongruity between man's nature and woman's.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.7 <###> It's something that should not be missed.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.7 <###> More than a little overbaked and frequently veering from the artistic to the artsy. But Louise Brooks is, herself, every inch a classic.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> Neither an expos&#233; of social conditions nor a psychological case study and certainly not a moral parable G. W. Pabst's Pandora's Box is a tour de force of cinematic eroticism.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> This is a stirring vision of the world gripped by a sinister moral vice--a nosedive into a carnal abyss of despair lined with visionary chiaroscuro sights and thorny mythological references.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.875 <###> One of the great films about the mysterious allure of the female form and the destructive power of the male gaze that's inflicted upon it.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> Miss Brooks is attractive and she moves her head and eyes at the proper moment, but whether she is endeavoring to express joy, woe, anger or satisfaction it is often difficult to decide.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> It's a stunning film, no question, with sexuality that is quite frank for its day, effective atmosphere and, of course, Brooks' stunning performance.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> One of those revered classics, so steeped in critical hysteria that it's almost heresy to question its greatness.
351527026 <###> Pandora's Box <###> Drama;Art House & International;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> This synopsis could apply equally to a great or a laughable film. Brooks makes it a great one.
10334 <###> The Man Who Knew Too Much <###> Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> James Stewart is superb, and Bernard Miles and Brenda de Banzie make admirable adversaries.
10334 <###> The Man Who Knew Too Much <###> Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> Making marvellous use of settings and locations, Hitchcock treats the viewer to superbly choreographed set-pieces.
10334 <###> The Man Who Knew Too Much <###> Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> ...a decent thriller that's ultimately saved by its stellar performances and absolutely enthralling last act.

10334 <###> The Man Who Knew Too Much <###> Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> Each version has certain elements superior to the other, but both films rank as minor Hitchcock works.

10334 <###> The Man Who Knew Too Much <###> Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.84 <###> The result is a typically memorable Hitchcock thriller, with great dialogue, building tension, and innocent people forced to get themselves out of trouble on their own.
10334 <###> The Man Who Knew Too Much <###> Mystery & Suspense;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> A road trip with James Stewart and Doris Day traipsing from Morocco to London, it's two hours of red herrings and intense scenes, one of the least apologetic adventures he ever made.
771387846 <###> Margarita, With A Straw <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Bose has to handle a difficult balancing act, to empathise with the difficulties Laila faces but also appreciate the effect they have on those that surround her; she pulls it off with dignity and some style.

16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Pearl Harbor is a bomb, make no mistake. But the movie is such a noisy, persistent bomb that it is guaranteed to draw a crowd.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> Bay seems temperamentally incapable of holding a shot for much more than five seconds.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> Weaknesses of plot and characterisation are only amplified by the film's unwieldy size and patriotic portent, and the script is toe-curlingly bad.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> While the film manages to drag the actual attack out to 45 minutes of its ponderous 183 minute running time, that still leaves a lot of movie to be taken up by what passes for plot -- a convoluted romance of the heavily cliched kind.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Watch, enjoy, and then forget about it entirely.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.25 <###> Even the much-vaunted depiction of the Japanese attack, while often visually arresting, still suffers from over-frenetic editing and more emphasis on adventure thrills than befits the tragedy of Pearl Harbor.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.25 <###> There's a certain symbolic symmetry here. The Navy and Walt Disney have teamed up on the production, and both view history as something to be managed and exploited.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> This violent movie is worth seeing, but only once.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.2 <###> May be the closest thing to a good movie Michael Bay will ever direct; unfortunately, it's still not very close to a good movie.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> The filmmakers would like you to know that this isn't typical action fare yet they've still created the most spectacular action scene in recent memory.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> [Michael] Bay didn't set out to make a film about Pearl Harbor. He set out to make a TITANIC clone that would go "Ka-ching" at the box office . . . Try TORA TORA TORA instead.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.7 <###> It's just a bit unfortunate that such an incredible, noble story, one which turned a nation around and galvanized a generation into action, should be told by such weak storytellers.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Bay's clunky and mammothly plodding Pearl Harbor is one movie that tries to do too many things at once without concentrating on any one specific point...the romance and action sequences are fussed over yet they deliver nothing really spectacular
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> A huge steaming pile of cheese with an admittedly spectacular central sequence that is ultimately worth the price of admission.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Ambitious, reverent and beautifully photographed though it is, Pearl Harbor ultimately is not equal to its aspirations.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> Sure, some twists are forced (I didn't buy the way the love triangle was set up nor how it was resolved), but for the most part, the movie worked me like a puppet. I laughed, I cried, I shuddered, I was thrilled... The works, basically.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.3 <###> Pearl Harbor is what you get when you cross Independence Day with Titanic, with the result possessing the good qualities of neither. The movie gave me a stomachache, literally.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Bay is the most dangerous of directors, a hack who believes himself an auteur.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Pearl Harbor es un perfecto claroscuro. Tiene momentos realmente brillantes, asi como pasajes cursis y aburridamente melodramaticos.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> So mesmo um diretor como Michael Bay poderia transformar o tragico ataque japones a base naval americana de Pearl Harbor em puro entretenimento - e isso nao e um elogio..
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.25 <###> [Pearl Harbor] makes no attempt to teach a lesson in history, for fear of losing the interest of 12-year-olds and high-school teeny-boppers. Insulting.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.25 <###> A mindless action movie passing as a serious war epic that is dragged out, unsure, and quite random.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> Ultimately, what can be said about the film is that it is a disappointment ... It also confirms what most industry people suspected: Michael Bay is no James Cameron.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> It's big, bold, inspiring and spectacular ... but it's also mind-numbingly stupid.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> The cast has the right stuff to meet the requirements set forth by director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> ...cliched... stereotyped... commonplace. The words 'unmitigated hokum' kept going through my mind as I watched it.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> As subtle as any Michael Bay movie.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.2 <###> Boring, unpleasant and ghoulish. Surely the people who died at Pearl Harbor deserve better than this.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.125 <###> A cheerfully offensive rape of history.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Su falta del factor humano termina por hundirla bajo el peso de sus desmedidas y desorbitadas pretensiones
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> Pearl Harbor is product, not film.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Arrive late, leave early, go home satisfied.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.2 <###> Director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer's World War II behemoth has only three operating modes: sub-Titanic romantic mush, jingoistic hokum and lovingly rendered carnage.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> The melodramatic love triangle that fuels the movie's story until and beyond the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor is both clumsy and unmoving
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> "Pearl Harbor" isn't anywhere near what it could have been as a movie, but the battle scenes are astonishing and it has a passable love story.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.25 <###> ...the ending seems so unfinished that it leaves audience members feeling like they've been stranded in an active battleground.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> It's safe to say that the battle scenes are terrific, while the love story is not.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> A thoroughly well-built dramatic actioner.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> "Why is everybody so determined to hate this movie???"
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> Pearl Harbor's love story is tailor made for daytime soap operas.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> The actual war wasn't this dang long.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> For sheer eye-popping spectacle, makes Titanic look like a kiddies' bath toy.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> This is definitely an epic action blockbuster. It's trying to be with out shame.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.25 <###> On December 7, 1941, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. On May 25, 2001, Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay did it again.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.375 <###> Bay and company chose to prop up a poorly written romance as an epic, with death, war, and mayhem as plot devices.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Two-thirds processed cheese, one-third pure gold
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.69 <###> The action is great, but the human side of the film sinks like a torpedoed battleship.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Affleck, Hartnett, and Beckinsdale look gorgeous and do their best to give some depth to the cardboard characters, but they cannot overcome a soapy plot and dialogue that is often wooden and sometimes wildly anachronistic.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Ships, planes and water combust and collide in Pearl Harbor, but nothing else does in one of the wimpiest wartime romances ever filmed.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Clearly, neither screenwriter Randall Wallace nor director Michael Bay ever met a cliche he didn't embrace.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Bay takes the easy way out with this movie, shunning the real pain of the attack to concentrate on the shallow feelings of his stars.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> It gets the job done.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> Eager viewers will encounter an extravagant, often breathtaking, sometimes trite, old-fashioned Hollywood spectacle, an ultra-romanticized wartime epic that owes much more to Titanic than to Saving Private Ryan.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> The bulk of the three-hour epic is third-rate schmaltz that pays only lip service to history.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.25 <###> The attack sequence in Pearl Harbor shows technical smarts to spare. Where matters of emotional and political truth are concerned, it's crude and jingoistic beyond compare.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> The date that will live in infamy has been reduced to a movie that is mired in mediocrity.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.375 <###> An unremarkable action movie; Pearl Harbor supplies the subject, but not the inspiration.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Intermittently cliche, the film finds a way to answer each indulgent (sometimes laughable) moment of schmaltz with a genuine solid silver edgy moment someplace else.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> While sheer spectacle may be good enough for an ever-easy-to-please moviegoing public, it cannot be for Bay, who so clearly, desperately strove for so much more.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.1 <###> "Titanic" meets "Saving Private Ryan" with a good dose of "Gomer Pyle" added to the brew... could have been subtitled "World War II for Dummies."
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> There's nothing more debilitating than filmmakers who do not trust their own source material.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> When Bay eventually delivers his precision-choreographed action, he elevates the strike above the schmaltz and nearly achieves epic status.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> A script with the most underdeveloped characters and spectacularly realized visuals since Titanic.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Better to wait until it's available on video and you have the option of using a fast-forward button.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Unfortunately, pasted around that stunning [action] sequence is a story so clogged with cliches of every description, so overblown, bombastic and agonizingly sentimental that it's hard to watch it with a straight face.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> An average flick that doesn't need to be seen in the theatres unless you really wanna check out all of its awesome visuals on the big screen.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.2 <###> A bloated, waterlogged catastrophe that looks and feels phony in every detail, from the mossy cliches of Randall Wallace's script to the gleaming computerized perfection of its curiously bloodless battle scenes.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Call it WWII Lite.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Weak on script but BIG on action.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> As impressive as the two immense battle scenes are, they're just not worth suffering through the other two hours of the movie to witness.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.375 <###> You probably at least feel like crying that such an important event in our country's history has been turned into a silly romance with one cliched line after another. What a colossal wasted opportunity.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Pyrotechnics and romance but, like 'Moulin Rouge,' without soul.
16950 <###> Pearl Harbor <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Romance <###> 0.25 <###> Middlingly racist, humorless, and downright inept, Pearl Harbor is solely for fans of fireworks factories.

And both groups will chuckle more than once.
770669872 <###> No Country for Old Men <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.9 <###> A terrific return to form on a par with Fargo and other Coen classics.
770669872 <###> No Country for Old Men <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 1.0 <###> Written almost exclusively in taut dialogue, the book already reads like a screenplay, and the Coen brothers have taken full advantage.
770669872 <###> No Country for Old Men <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> In a sense, the film is a lament for old certainties which are cruelly swept aside, perhaps purged would be more accurate, by Bardem's extraordinary monster.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.2 <###> Lions for Lambs is movie mutton.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.375 <###> The film's points are made obvious the first minute and then monotonously drilled ad nauseum the remaining 87.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Slowly, you suffer the creeping realization that nothing is going to happen. Nothing.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> The absence of activists in the streets protesting the war in Iraq continues to confound; the empty seats at theaters showing Lions for Lambs will be somewhat easier to explain.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It attempts to conquer social, political and military all in the same film, but it doesn't knock any of them out of the park.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> For all of its good intentions and clear-eyed idealism, Lions for Lambs is not a movie, it is a political science lecture.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> The interwoven narrative strategy that gradually reveals hidden connections is so old hat at this point that it feels more hackneyed than revelatory, even in such highly concentrated form.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.3 <###> I'm not sure why Producer-director Robert Redford and writer Matthew Carnahan thought this was cinematic, but they were wrong.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> The long-winded speeches were made tolerable by the superb acting, but I got the point long before the speeches were over. I would have liked more of Luke and Pena. Still, Meryl Streep could easily grab a nomination. Meryl never whimpers - she roars.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Say this for Hollywood: At least it's trying to inject some semblance of sane debate into the Iraq War debacle ... But do its recruitment tools have to be so ineffectual?
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Una pelicula tan bienintencionada y oportuna como demagogica y sensiblera. Plantea un atendible debate de ideas, pero carece de personajes interesantes y, en definitiva, de fuerza dramatica.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Carnahan and Redford show that politicians bank on public apathy, and the film ends up as a call to action for people to simply become more engaged.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Gushing about Streep is almost embarrassing, but...
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The film is built not upon characters and plot but upon ideas. That would be fine if the ideas were revolutionary or interesting, but they're fairly commonplace.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.2 <###> An uninvolving and depressing serving of talk about the inadequacy of politicians, the power of the media, senseless deaths overseas, and the apathy of youth.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Polemics can be very entertainment. Intellectual argument films are just boring.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Has the good sense to get in, make its case -- however clunky it may be -- and get out in under 90 minutes. The sad thing is that even at that brief length, it feels padded.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> It's a great muddle from the word go.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> "Lions for Lambs" could talk pro-war and anti-war coalitions to sleep.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Why aren't these actors helping troops' families or give injured solders jobs in movies so they can support their loved ones? No matter what side of this issue you support, standing on the sidelines and throwing stones only leads to more stone-throwing.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Plays the same bloated Hollywood strings.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.25 <###> Pontificating aplenty in Robert Redford's preachy anti-war polemic.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> One successful story out of three is not good enough as Redford steps up to the plate. Too little first rate photography and too much collegiate tedium.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Score one for Robert Redford.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> This is an unapologetically liberal film. Does it preach to the choir? Absolutely. My own left-leaning views being what they are, I liked it on those terms, even as I acknowledge that some complexity would have been nice.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Agree or disagree, love it or hate it, you won't be able to turn away. It's Robert Redford's urgent, impassioned wake up call for America.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.25 <###> Meryl Streep gets yelled at by Tom Cruise in Lions for Lambs. A no-name actor gets yelled at by Robert Redford. And us? We get yelled at by everyone.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> In the end, it all remains a dramatically inert set of talking points, and not even the high-caliber cast can make much more out of it.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.375 <###> There is much talk of paralysis in Robert Redford's what's-wrong-with-America movie Lions for Lambs, and there is a whole lot of the same in the movie itself.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Though these dialogues are worthy, the medium doesn't seem right for the message.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> When a filmmaker directs himself in a role that's hopelessly dull, is that professional suicide, or just kindness in not burdening some other actor with the part?
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> It's a fictional tale that has the immediacy of something hot off the presses -- something raw and clunky, but plugged into the moment - with characters talking about the same things people are talking about outside the theater.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Lions for Lambs is insightful and provocative.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> This sometimes heavy-handed sermon about political apathy among the young, the stakes of media collusion with government, and the fog of war is almost certain to scare off the people it is intended to reach.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.375 <###> Lions for Lambs is Redford's latest film as a director. It's also, sadly, one of his weakest.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Unfortunately, a single, compelling plot would have been far more effective than earnest lectures in triplicate.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It's commendable that the filmmakers didn't make a strident screed, but did they have to settle for a waffling yak-fest?
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Unlike other recent dramas such as Rendition, the film never feels like it's preaching. Instead, it just urges: Whatever you believe, do something.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Lions for Lambs is Hollywood's latest casualty of war, a movie undone not by its heart (which is in the right place) but by its stilted, obvious and one-sided presentation.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The filmmaking is a bit clunky, and the three stories don't quite add up; what we have here is just not fully engaging.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Lions for Lambs marks Robert Redford's seventh film as director...and it's certainly not his best. But I'll say this for it: It's his bravest.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The film doesn't so much end as just stop. We're left thinking less about what we've heard than about what we haven't seen -- a satisfying movie.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Lions for Lambs is a civics lesson, necessary to be sure, but leaving us drained of resolve, wading in the morass it hoped to pull us out of.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It does not feel good to report that a movie with Robert Redford, Meryl Streep, and Tom Cruise makes the eyelids droop. But that's what Lions for Lambs does.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> An arresting political expose punctuated by stellar acting and resonant messages about leadership, sacrifice and responsibility.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Redford and Carnahan would like us to ponder our role in their fate. And maybe we would, if the lecture weren't so dull and self-satisfied.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> ... a relevant message unfortunately wrapped up in an oddly discordant, moderately self-righteous package which is probably going to go right over the heads of most of the people at whom it's targeted.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Feels like a really good off-Broadway play - stripped of artifice, its sharp commentary to the point, making its stinging points more through words than action.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Lions for Lambs simply isn't fresh or courageous enough to make an impact let alone a difference.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.2 <###> Tedious, preaching-to-the-converted drama with lifeless direction and a shockingly ham-fisted script.

770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.2 <###> Pure fence-sitting liberal agony is all that's on offer here, in a muddled and pompous film about America's war on terror.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Fortunately for [Redford], Lions for Lambs is a less ham-handed effort than Sayles' Silver City, but it's a near thing.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Unexpectedly riveting.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> There's a message behind Lions for Lambs, Robert Redford's latest outing as a director. And my goodness don't we know it by the end of a 94-minute hectoring that feels far, far longer.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> ...impassioned and mercifully brief.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Not a lot of entertainment with this edification. It's thought-provoking, but so's CNN.
770669875 <###> Lions for Lambs <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Preachy, worthy and far too wordy, Lions For Lambs doesn't roar so much as bleat. Less a movie than a bungled party political broadcast on behalf on the United Artists party.

771313374 <###> Rush <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> As well as brandishing his usual mastery for pacing gutsy dramas, [director Ron] Howard's command over his division of digital artists results in some great sequences once the action moves to the track.

771313374 <###> Rush <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> [It's] about auto racing... but it's much more interesting in showing how two men compete with each other without losing their souls in the process.

771313374 <###> Rush <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> Howard pulls off a dramatic switcheroo in "Rush." He presents characters in competition, one a golden god, the other a repellent Ratso - and by the end, we root for Ratso.

771313374 <###> Rush <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> No need to rush right out and see this one. Barely made fresh in my book. Other than the last half-hour, this one has zip for tension, action or interest.
771313374 <###> Rush <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> RUSH has some well crafted racing sequences, but the two lead characters are a pair of the biggest jerk faces! Good direction doesn't mean anything when you couldn't care less about its unlikable, egotistical characters.
771313374 <###> Rush <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> Rush has an elemental simplicity about it. Two men in competition, driven (so to speak) to win. They are enemies. But they need each other, too, and as they roll around at 170 m.p.h., they come to understand why.

771313374 <###> Rush <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> ... one of Howard's best. Maybe it was going back to the era of his directing debut, 1976's Eat My Dust, and revisiting its subject matter (fast cars) that kicked Howard's aesthetic drive into gear.
771313374 <###> Rush <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> There is a certain romance to men risking death for fame and glory, but try as it might this movie can't manage to dive beneath this superficial level.

771235536 <###> Risen <###> Art House & International;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Stodgy fare that eulogises the man rather than delving deeply into his compelling life.

771317257 <###> Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow <###> Drama;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> It's harder to bear how the film fuses its sci-fi premise with an action movie's sensibility: one in which the characters become living, breathing video-game avatars, rather than human beings.
771317257 <###> Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow <###> Drama;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> It seems to know what we've all been forgetting since 1985: science fiction can be funny, blockbusters can be kooky, and Tom Cruise can, and should, be a jackass.

13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Dealing with urban paranoia from a White POV is a good, timely idea, but film can't decide whether Michael Douglas is an ordinary or psychopathic man and whether we should feel sympathy or pity for the "victimization" of this yuppie.
13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Douglas' tortured misfit is a chore to watch.
13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> A powerful, gripping, darkly humorous film with a dynamite lead performance by Michael Douglas. One of 1993's ten-best films.

13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Falling Down offers an interesting concept that is handled with the grace of a psycho wielding a baseball bat.
13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Great action and commentary on the working man. Kinda wished for a more ironic ending though.
13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> Schumacher's hostile study of urban angst and the breakdown of a fragile crewcut crusader (Douglas) is downright suspenseful if not wryly witty in its caustic conception
13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> It turns one man's slide toward madness into a wickedly mischievous, entertaining suspense thriller.
13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> It's hard not to root for this embodiment of white man's angst ... the ending seems stilted, as if to say "we must openly condemn him while we secretly admire him."
13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> A sweaty and fascinating look at one modern man's descent.

13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> Douglas' portrayal of a man heading for the abyss is utterly convincing.
13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> The film ... is actually about a great sadness which turns into madness, and which can afflict anyone who is told, after many years of hard work, that he is unnecessary and irrelevant.
13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> While the morality of D-Fens methods are questionable, there's a resonance about his reaction to everyday annoyances, and Michael Douglas' hypnotic performance makes it memorable.
13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.75 <###> At its heart, this is very dark satire, and there are a good many laughs. But there are times when one wishes that the comedy could remain with the problems being solved in less violent ways.
13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> Schumacher at first seems like an odd choice to helm this taut, over-the-edge thriller but at closer inspection, it's obvious that The Powers That Be chose him for his ability to add the necessary action-genre punch...
13534 <###> Falling Down <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> An uneven and frequently pretentious story that is never as important or dramatic as it thinks it is.

326299226 <###> A Cantor's Tale <###> Documentary;Drama;Musical & Performing Arts;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> It's Mendelson's love of chazzanut, and of music in general, that drives this engaging film; anyone familiar with the power of music to transcend language and cut straight to powerful, transformative emotions will find his passion irresistible.

98822848 <###> The French Connection II <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics <###> 0.73 <###> If you take away comparisons with the original, it's a reasonably solid, if flawed, crime thriller; but it does shrink into the shadow cast by its vastly superior predecessor.
98822848 <###> The French Connection II <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics <###> 0.75 <###> More conventional than its predecessor, but it's still unconventional by the cop thriller standard set by a wash of anonymous, lesser films. [Blu-ray]

771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> A silly inane story lacking strong characters and ay sense of adventure.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> A creaking "star vehicle" for two stars who should have known better, and maybe had a little chemistry.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> [The Tourist] is very entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable from the very start and doesn't let up until the screen goes black, which is something that very few films are able to pull off nowadays.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Overall an interesting and at times very gripping film, but one that perhaps could have done with taking a few more risks
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> It's a self-conscious attempt at a Hollywood caper with the mix of comedy, romance and conspiracy watered down to the point where you can see straight through it.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Depp and Jolie together create a chemical black hole. They couldn't produce sparks with dry hair and a comb.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> Something has gone really, really wrong here.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> I'm afraid the stars' vacation videos are probably more interesting than this poorly handled mistaken-identity caper, which isn't funny enough to be a comedy or dramatic enough to be a thriller.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> An incredibly dull low-key thriller barely driven by its two A-list leads.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> On paper, The Tourist sounds like a dream film -- two of the hottest actors alive, in a charmingly frothy romantic crime caper set in one of the most beautiful cities on earth. So why didn't it come alive on screen?
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The Tourist is best considered an expensive travel ad for Venice rather than the sexy, action-packed, sassy thriller we were all hoping for.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> The Tourist is a mildly pleasant cinematic journey.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Teria sido melhor acompanhar a viagem da personagem em tempo real ate a cidade italiana do que ve-la percorrendo sonambula as maquinacoes estupidas de um roteiro sabotado pela falta de entusiasmo de um cineasta com preguica.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Hampered by its lack of narrative tension or palpable sense of romance.

771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> It is disheartening on a profound level to see a group of talented actors and filmmakers come together at the height of their powers and produce something of such soul-killing drudgery as The Tourist.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> While this farcical thriller can certainly be classified as a no-brainer, it is only on the grounds of sustained mindlessness that the tag truly sticks.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> It's a beautiful film to look at. Unfortunately for The Tourist, looks ain't everything.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> A bland, badly directed, star-driven cinematic molestation of Jerome Salle's tight-as-a-drum 2005 French thriller Anthony Zimmer.

771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> "Sure, the plot is preposterous, but the two stars look great, the scenery is spectacular and the supporting cast is a hoot."
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Tepid romance and sluggish action can't match the beauty of Venice.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> The film bears less resemblance to the vintage international-intrigue movies it tries to imitate than, well, an e-cigarette does to a Gitanes.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> What's not to enjoy?
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Except for the opening surveillance sequence, you'd never guess that Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck also directed the Oscar-winning The Lives of Others.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Is it really that bad? No, instead it's that indifferent, which is somehow more distressing.

771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Frequently feels as if it has been assembled in some strange parallel world, one where Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie possess none of the charisma or subversive appeal that has consistently made each of them a magnetic screen presence...
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> It bides time while watching extras watching Jolie do her fashion-model strut, her famous lips pursed just so. It doesn't help that she is so icily imperious that she seems more like a creepily gorgeous space alien than an actual human being.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> The damn thing's been soundtracked within an inch of its life. Whenever Ange glides into a room it sounds like a concert harpist's having a coronary.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> The only thing worth noting is that the film is beautifully shot, but too bad 'The Tourist' is a just a lifeless, boring romantic mess.

771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The movie changes tones like a chameleon and is unable to decide if it wants to be a thriller, a romance or a comedic parody. It never amounts to much and runs on empty through most of the 104-minute running time. Don'tbe among the...
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> It's actually rare for me to see a film that is such an utter failure on so many levels.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Fraudulent where it should be smart, impotent where it should be sexy, and dull where it should be exciting, The Tourist is a big star misfire of epic proportions.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> A rather goofy action comedy that deflates the suspense by telling us pretty much everything from the start
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> A multiplex trip that's only slightly less annoying than a case of Montezuma's revenge.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> This unthrilling thriller is burdened by two superstars with no chemistry between them. There is one good line, the last one uttered, hardly worth waiting for.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Venice is pretty alright, but like its namesake (or, for that matter, like a kidney stone), The Tourist is just passing through.

771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> As is often the case with movies like this, it looks like the stars are having a whole lot more fun than the audience.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.0 <###> In a year of craptaculars, The Tourist deserves burial at the bottom of the 2010 dung heap.

771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> What can be said is that von Donnersmarck, who shot so claustrophobically in The Lives of Others, does know how to shoot wide to capture beauty and opulence as well as action.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> The Tourist is memorable for one thing, at least. It's the first movie to make Venice look boring.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Johnny Depp is such a talented chameleon that when he portrays someone who is supposed to be boring, he actually is boring.

771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Star power can cover up a multitude of shortcomings in a film. Turns out stupidity isn't one of them.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> So deficient in the genre's essentials - such as witty dialogue, intriguing characters and surprising yet credible plot turns - that you're embarrassed for everyone involved.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Too bad most of the fun on-screen seems to be reserved for the people who actually made "The Tourist" - while all we get is a postcard.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Undeniably the big misfire of the season. Good looking locations, and sexy stars don't make up for a lack of chemistry, and a tepid plot.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Depp can't sell the "tourist" look. At the very worst, he looks like he could be working as a coffee kiosk barista at the Alitalia terminal in Rome's Leonardo Da Vinci Fiumicino Airport.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> A movie that is glamorous and handsome, but no more so than a six-page Vanity Fair fashion spread shot on location on the canals of Venice and starring these two overqualified model/stars.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Pretty people. Pretty scenery. Pretty bland.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> ...a limp Vogue layout: easy on the eyes, completely devoid of anything else.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Von Donnersmarck, who brilliantly depicted government surveillance in East Berlin before the fall of the wall in his earlier German film, astonishingly can't even find a way to make Interpol's spying interesting here.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> The high wattage of stars Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie cast the film in a spotlight that would be unflattering for most movies, least of all an insubstantial, tension-free thriller like this.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Tries to make up for the story's complete lack of significance or motion with some very nice scenery and a few very nice people. It does that so well that at times, it's almost enough.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The defining characteristics of The Tourist are its overt efforts to emphasize that Angelina Jolie is beautiful and that Johnny Depp is a 'regular guy.'
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.8 <###> This movie is like a fancy sundae, a concoction of sweet thrills and empty calories. We shouldn't take too long admiring it, because it'll melt if we do. Just scoop it up, enjoy the sugary rush and smile.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> Enjoyable but light on substance...
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> As the closing credits begin to roll, I found myself wanting to say, "That's nice Florian. Isn't that cute. Now put away your toys and get back to work."
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> There are all kinds of bad movies in the world, but it's really only stardom that can create the exact variety of cinematic abortion we find in "The Tourist."
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> It's nice to see a movie resurrect the playful banter that was standard procedure in the '50s. A better idea, though, would have been to address the foundation of the house (story), rather than the window dressing (dialogue, star power).
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.3 <###> ... it's a bit of a shock to see this caliber of star power and big-budget production and location juice... yield such dismal results.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> If the film were any less significant, it would simply evaporate from existence.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> There is a moment in "The Tourist" when Johnny Depp turns to Angelina Jolie and asks "Why is all this happening?" It's a question moviegoers will be asking themselves as well.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Showing off your stars, ogling the Grand Canal and draping everyone in Colleen Atwood's glamorous threads is not enough in itself to pass as Hitchcock homage, unless your favourite Hitchcock film is To Catch a Thief.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Unfortunately, the funny side of the film is abandoned quickly, and the muddled plot disappears bubblingly into the lagoon.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Jolie is gorgeous, but photographed in reverent profile, like a Roman coin. Depp is amusingly droll, but it turns out that "mild" for this great actor looks a lot like "sleepy."
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.125 <###> Enduring "The Tourist" is like going for a ride in a sinking gondola.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> It may be the only movie ever to feature a bad performance by Johnny Depp, one of the best actors working in films. Who knew he could be wooden and unconvincing in a role?
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The good news is that Jolie and Depp accessorize nicely together. He rarely gets to spar with women in his weight class, and his slovenly approach to stardom might be the antidote for Jolie's solemnity.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Think about adding To Catch a Thief or Charade to your Netflix queue instead.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie, benchmarks for sexual arousal in other movies, have zero emotional and physical chemistry in The Tourist.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> As a thriller, The Tourist makes a good travelogue.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.375 <###> A frothy bit of cloak-and-dagger intrigue where the cloak isn't billowy enough to cover the script's multiple plot inconsistencies, and the dagger's about as dull as a butter knife.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> It all comes down to chemistry, and Depp and Jolie don't have it. At least not in these roles.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The Tourist is like a beautifully decorated shop window -- with no shop behind it.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> The Tourist has all the hallmarks of a sleekly diverting Euro-thriller, and sets about proving that hallmarks are not enough.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> One of those frustrating almost-good films which never really catches fire.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.9 <###> It's the kind of espionage caper that doesn't get made anymore, a visually sensuous picture made with tender attention to detail and an elegant, understated sense of humor.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> Yes, it's dreck, but we've all seen duff movies. What makes this so painfully exasperating is that 'The Tourist' is so bloody pleased with itself.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.2 <###> Depp's character is an uneasy blend of hammy matinee idol and Clouseau-like farceur, while Jolie is in the running for the most annoying and insipid ice maiden in cinema history.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> There are worse ways to spend two hours than watching lush visuals of Venice. But the city's sinking fast -- and the same goes for The Tourist.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Let's not mince words; The Tourist is one of the most outstandingly atrocious films of the year.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> The Tourist gets sillier as the plot crawls along, its pace so slow that the movie could well put Ambien out of business once it starts showing up on late-night cable TV.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> "The Tourist" is a facsimile of a masquerade of a gloss on "Charade," and on all the lesser cinematic charades that followed in the wake of director Stanley Donen's 1963 picture.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.25 <###> When not simply functioning as a sorry excuse for a thriller, The Tourist also operates as the Angelina Jolie Ego Trip Show.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> The plot is preposterous. So what you need is a movie that floats with bemusement above the cockamamie, and actors who tease each other.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Jolie has never been more Jolie, Depp has never been less Depp, and it adds up to nothing.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Another painfully dull movie about an American in Europe hoping to capitalize on the looks and fame of its stars.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.0 <###> Do anything. Arrange an appointment in Sumatra. Go to the moon. At all costs stay away.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.4 <###> Beautifully shot thriller that gains points for sheer star power but ultimately delivers very little in terms of action, adventure or romance.
771035591 <###> The Tourist <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Pretty stars in exotic settings with a hint of excitement and an air of mystery. Ah, Salt by Chanel.

13753 <###> Devil in a Blue Dress <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 1.0 <###> The role of Easy looks as tailor-made for Mr. Washington as his suit, and it shows off the full effect of this actor's movie-star dazzle.

13753 <###> Devil in a Blue Dress <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> I liked the movie without quite being caught up in it: I liked the period, tone and look more than the story, which I never really cared much about.
13753 <###> Devil in a Blue Dress <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A hoary Chinatown knock-off wrapped in a seductively novel black-culture veneer, with a dash of Laura added for bad measure.

13752 <###> Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The results are uneven and occasionally mind-bogglingly bad (which is partly the point), but they're never what you'd call dull.
13752 <###> Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> And what, pray tell, is the Big JC doing wasting his time helping Canadians?
13752 <###> Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter <###> Action & Adventure;Horror;Musical & Performing Arts;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The basic premise alone is worth the price of admission for this one.
771211716 <###> Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> ...the characters are appealing, and the plot is pure hokum, just as in the cartoon series.

771253877 <###> Union Square <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Long stretches of "Union Square" are kind of irksome to watch, as you just have to wait for all the bickering and chatter to calm down in order for the true drama to begin. But once we get to the emotional boxing, we see how hurt these women really are.
771253877 <###> Union Square <###> Drama <###> 0.44 <###> Lucy's general unpleasantness is a hurdle the film can't clear.

771253877 <###> Union Square <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Propelled by a rangy, superbly colorful performance by Mira Sorvino, the film grabs hold of the viewer from the jump and snowballs toward a deftly moving and concise third act.
771253877 <###> Union Square <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Just when it seems to be going [for] an amusing family Thanksgiving comedy, it zings sharply (and awkwardly) into exposing raw emotions from painful wounds sisters share.
771253877 <###> Union Square <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> It doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is - a slice-o'-life domestic drama/dark comedy of manners savvy about its limits and sufficiently disciplined to keep its convolutions to a credible, impactful minimum.
771253877 <###> Union Square <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Sorvino brings a spark, but neither she nor Patti LuPone, in an amusing cameo, can overcome the clockwork-like plod to the end.
771253877 <###> Union Square <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> An interesting study of families, of class-consciousness, of little passive-aggressive tricks.
771253877 <###> Union Square <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> "Union Square" has the busy, hemmed-in talkiness of a theater piece, with too much forced to happen in too short a time. But it also has a lively, nervous energy and an expansive sympathy for the mismatched women at its heart.
771253877 <###> Union Square <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Despite its problems, there's a touching sweetness at the heart of Nancy Savoca's intimate family drama about estranged sisters trying to reconnect.
771253877 <###> Union Square <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The look is minimalist but the two lead actresses add pleasing layers to characters of estranged sisters who parted ways for reasons Lucy refers to only cryptically.
771253877 <###> Union Square <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Character-driven drama about two estranged sisters who reach a point where they must choose either reconciliation or permanent separation from each other.
771253877 <###> Union Square <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> With its small cast and focus on performance, Union Square promises to be a welcome showcase for Sorvino, and the early rhymes with Miss Linda are intriguingly open-ended.

770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Plays out with such daunting high-mindedness it makes The Reader look like Transformers.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Fugitive Pieces reduces the Holocaust and its aftermath to a cosy soap opera.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.666666666667 <###> One of the most delicate, approachable and rewarding Holocaust movies of recent years.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Given the source novel, Podeswa's attempt to adapt Fugitive Pieces is admirable in itself. Yet despite an enthusiastic cast, this fails to transport you in the same way. Tying itself in narrative knots, the end result is stilted.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The movie has little dramatic momentum, and its journey is essentially Jakob's incremental acceptance of his fate. But Dillane and the writer-director Jeremy Podeswa create such a compelling central character that it hardly matters.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> His journey towards peace of mind involves lots of lyrical philosophising, which presumably comes straight from the film's source novel, by Anne Michaels, and doesn't lend itself to dramatisation, despite Dillane's typically intelligent performance.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Anne Michael's complex, poetic novel is here adapted into a stolid, somewhat po-faced film, but one that still manages to tease some affecting drama out of its scholarly premise.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Despite a rich premise, the soul-searching of the older Jakob is, at best, curiously colourless; at worst, positively grating.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> An intermittently powerful, if not entirely successful, piece.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> But while there's life, there's hope, and Jeremy Podeswa's delicate, deliberate adaptation of Anne Michaels' novel follows Jakob's heartrending progress from the darkness to the light.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> There are fleeting moments of poignancy and poetry, significantly when the script features narration taken almost directly from the novel, but this is clunkily written and poorly edited.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Jeremy Podeswa's tremulous adaptation of Anne Michaels's novel aches with earnest intent and tasteful eroticism, yet it moves as heavily and lugubriously as a prison gate.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Engaging, well acted and ultimately moving drama.

770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> take a dip into this thoughtful and intimate portrait of a man slowly warming to the beauty of life as he shakes off the ghosts of a family lost in the Holocaust.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> A sentimental journey through inheriting loneliness and sadness from fathers to sons, and their female fantasies, relieved by beautiful language and cinematography.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Though the strong performances from the brooding Dillane and the ever-good Serbedzija keep things from getting dull, the film does meander its way to a final act that simply peters out.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Writer-director Jeremy Podeswa, another Canadian, doesn't try to reproduce the talk on film, which is a wise move.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.833333333333 <###> Nuanced, scrupulous and powerful...
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> A powerful and emotional journey of a man trying to come to terms with history.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> An almost strenuously dignified enterprise.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Fugitive Pieces delivers its own evocative poetry.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.85 <###> ... defaults to a kind of poetic conventionality that is unlikely to completely satisfy fans of either The Pianist or The Love Letter.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Fugitive Pieces is an often lovely work, haunting its viewer long afterward with its quiet observations on what remains with us.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> If Fugitive Pieces has a message, it is that life can heal us, if we allow it.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Fugitive Pieces is often quiet, lyrical, reflective and underplayed. It doesn't minimize Holocaust suffering--far from it--but it strives, often successfully, to unearth the innate good in people Anne Frank alluded to so eloquently.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The cast is uniformly attractive and earnest. But the romanticized image of the tortured artist is the stuff of stereotype unless it's leavened with humor, or limned in art. In Fugitive Pieces, neither element appears in sufficient quantity.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The film can barely breathe, much less move.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Sensitively adapted from the achingly sad, luminous novel by Anne Michaels, Fugitive Pieces is a story of unspeakable loss and how it eats at the souls of survivors.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Feels less like a redemptive survivor's story and more like a commercial for some terrific Mediterranean resort.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Bit by fragmented bit, it all adds up to a one-note portrait of its protagonist. Granted, that one note is a powerful one.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Well acted but dramatically unyielding.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It's a character study in which the lead participant is the least interesting person in the movie. There's something inherently frustrating and unsatisfying about that.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Fugitive Pieces, however well-meaning, is still pretty much an emotionally distanced slog.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Though much of the film's power is tamped down by the passive storytelling style, Dillane's performance as the adult Jakob is compelling, and Ayelet Zurer is beguiling as Jakob's late-in-life soul mate.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> [A] lovely, absorbing adaptation of Anne Michaels' lauded novel.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Like the Holocaust survivor who occupies its wounded centre, Jeremy Podeswa's elegant, stern adaptation of Anne Michaels' novel Fugitive Pieces keeps us quietly, intractably, at a distance.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> A demanding, but remarkably accomplished and moving film.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Once you adjust to the film's deliberate pace and literary rhythms, there are innumerable visual and emotional pleasures to be had.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> The strengths of Fugitive Pieces are its fluidity and subtlety. Emotional repression may be one of the most difficult conditions to portray honestly, and Dillane's performance of Jakob is a study in the art of creating sympathy by not asking for it.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> For a tale spiked with so much torment, Fugitive Pieces feels remarkably soothing.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> A poignant and heart-affecting screen adaptation of a 1996 novel about suffering and the redemptive power of love.
770684109 <###> Fugitive Pieces <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The best approach to the movie is to stay home with the celebrated novel on which it's based.

11457 <###> EDtv <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> EdTV isn't bad enough to get angry about, but it's a mundane and toothless satire.
11457 <###> EDtv <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's a slightly lackluster comedy that wants to have something to say, but never gets around to saying it. Or worse, says it, and the audience replies, 'And--?'
11457 <###> EDtv <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Its screenplay veers in highly questionable directions before reaching a mean-spirited climax that outweighs Ron Howard's workmanlike filmmaking and the contributions of a star-powered cast.
11457 <###> EDtv <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The best part of the film is the bright and accessible script, [and] with Ron Howard as the director, you can be sure that you'll leave with a satisfied smile on your face.
11457 <###> EDtv <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A fresh, insightful, and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity.
11457 <###> EDtv <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> An amiable goof of a comedy.
11457 <###> EDtv <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> A respectable, intelligent film, but one, to be sure, that prospers more while in the individual moments, rather than one that remains deeply ingrained in your long-term memory.
11457 <###> EDtv <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Though thunder lost to "The Truman Show", this screenplay still has real and punchy dialogue.
11450 <###> Monty Python and the Holy Grail <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> The Python team's surreal take on the legend of Camelot bursts with inspired lunacy.
11450 <###> Monty Python and the Holy Grail <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> This remains a wonderfully inventive comedy that brilliantly debunks the Dark Ages and legends of chivalry.
11450 <###> Monty Python and the Holy Grail <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Monty Python and the Holy Grail may be 26 years old, but even in the fast-moving world of pop culture, it's no relic. It's still the Holy Grail of crazy comedy.
11450 <###> Monty Python and the Holy Grail <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> There's a semblance of a plot, but this is really just an excuse for the boys to engage in their unique brand of humor, which includes mimicry, dress-up, dry wit, slapstick and glorious non sequitors.
11450 <###> Monty Python and the Holy Grail <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> If you like this film, the sad truth is that it's yet another visual upgrade, and it does contain what Gilliam called "the only reason for buying the Blu-ray"-those lost animations.
11450 <###> Monty Python and the Holy Grail <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> A comedy classic that only misses out on the Python canon's top spot because the talented swines also made Life Of Brian.
11450 <###> Monty Python and the Holy Grail <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> There's something about feature films that brings out the best in the Pythons. The occasional indulgence of the TV series is replaced by a more focused approach which wrings every conceivable joke out of a given subject.
11450 <###> Monty Python and the Holy Grail <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> A zany, hysterically funny, and sometimes brilliant if sometimes sophomoric send-up of every medieval movie ever made.

13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> In terms of Hollywood history, Bigelow's film is the perfect document of its time.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> There's fun to be had, but there's also a few chapters worth skipping through.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> While it can accurately be described as an action film, a heist movie, or even simply a thriller, Point Break is also the first "extreme sports" movie
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Enjoyable, if silly, action romp.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> brainless guilty pleasure
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> Far better than any film with such billing should be.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> The script is so lame it achieves a sort of magnificence, and the stunts are superb.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.7 <###> A lot of the snap comes, surprisingly, from Mr. Reeves, who displays considerable discipline and range. He moves easily between the buttoned-down demeanor that suits a police procedural story and the loose-jointed manner of his comic roles.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Most of this is standard fare, except for the parachuting stunts and surfing scenes, which are way above average.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> Bigelow forgot the most important ingredients for a successful action film -- plot and characters.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> An adrenaline-pumping action bonanza
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.2 <###> Kathryn Bigelow rips off the first 10 minutes of Moonraker and gets praised for it. Give me a break.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> dumb, testosterone-soaked big summer story by Kathryn Bigelow
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> Unfairly bashed. The true spirit of shirking society and catching a wave is captured here.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> The ultimate surfer/bank robber movie. 'Dude, I'm with the FBI.'
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> The hinted spirituality of the film is plainly silly, but it's quickly swallowed by the undertow of crashing spectacle.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> Bigelow has a sure hand in directing action sequences, and Point Break is full of them
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.8 <###> The elements conspire to produce a superb splash of trashy, testosterone-induced mayhem.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.875 <###> The plot of Point Blank, summarized, invites parody (rookie agent goes undercover as surfer to catch bank robbers). The result is surprisingly effective.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> Even Bigelow's best scenes, however, are occasionally undercut by her penchant for close-ups and MTV-style edits that confuse the audience about what exactly is happening during chaotic moments.
13320 <###> Point Break <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Bigelow stages the film's action sequences with a brutal efficiency (they almost redeem the movie), but she can't keep the increasingly silly script in check.
17122 <###> Vampire Hunter D <###> Horror;Animation;Anime & Manga;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Old enough that many of the anime techniques used herein have become cliche -- but still has a cool enough story to be worth a look.
17122 <###> Vampire Hunter D <###> Horror;Animation;Anime & Manga;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> More tedious and ugly anime

17121 <###> All Quiet on the Western Front <###> Drama;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> The performances are also exemplary, but it is primarily a film of great moments -- the climactic sequence of the young conscript reaching out for a butterfly in the sun -- that, once seen, are never forgotten.
17121 <###> All Quiet on the Western Front <###> Drama;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> The production values are incredibly high and not just for the time. And as the movie has aged and the film has gone grainier and the flickers increased, it almost adds to the effect.
17121 <###> All Quiet on the Western Front <###> Drama;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> The rawness of the audio eradicates any lingering notion that war is romantic or exciting, and at times suggests the very battered eardrums of those engaged in combat.

17121 <###> All Quiet on the Western Front <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.8 <###> Took an opportunity to question warfare and its civility long before the war protest film became popular in the 70s. It's dated, obviously, but still powerful.

17121 <###> All Quiet on the Western Front <###> Drama;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> There are few war films that can match the brilliance of Lewis Milestone's anti-war classic. It's a feast for the ears with a passionate soul.

17121 <###> All Quiet on the Western Front <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.6 <###> With no focus on one or even a handful of characters, Quiet is strangely uninvolving until it begins to concentrate on young Paul Baumer.
17121 <###> All Quiet on the Western Front <###> Drama;Classics <###> 0.875 <###> All Quiet on the Western Front is the definitive World War I motion picture, the best of a surprisingly small class of movies.

770682422 <###> Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> This music-powered hipster romance is as simple and undemanding as a three-chord pop song. It's as corny as rhyming "moon" with "June".

770682422 <###> Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The mood of the film is refreshingly relaxed on sexuality. One outbreak of homophobia is quickly punished with a headbutt by a butch boy with no name.

770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Antimatter and crosses. Science and religion. Angels and demons. You'll never guess, but it's more of a gray area than black and white. And for many of us, it's as close to Vatican City as we're going to get.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It's not his prose that makes Brown's novels such page-turners, it's that mix of thrilling conflict and old-world mystery. Take out the backstory and you basically have an empty episode of "24."

770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Not much heresy hereabouts but timid apologies for negative Vatican history attempts to whitewash things that can't be denied nor diminished. Me? I prefer my Dan Brown unadulterated and I'm satisfied with most of it.

770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.2 <###> As a cracking tale of code-cracking, Angels & Demons never really works. Howard doesn't create the drama of a great mind facing great challenges, struggling to see the truth as the clock ticks.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> It's a fine action thriller with a historical plot, but I'd strongly advise fans to read the novel too. It fills out a much more detailed plot. For a bit of lightweight fun, though, you won't go wrong here.

770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Let no man be so crude as to accuse it of its predecessor's insipidity. Let us be forgiving, and say that it is merely weak. It is the vanilla soft-serve of summer adventure movies.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> There's nothing heavenly about this bloated, windy movie.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A dumb, gorgeous popcorn chomper with a fabulous cast, for what it's worth, Angels and Demons is more enjoyable than its zillion-dollar sire, but that doesn't mean it's actually any good.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> This tepid movie is purposely meant to be confusing, with red herrings, plot twists and double crosses. It ultimately turns into a long ordeal to sit through at a plodding 138 minutes.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> A glum, by-the-numbers potboiler distinguished only by its admittedly handsome production values.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> As far as I'm concerned, Angels & Demons is the first bona fide dud of the 2009 summer movie season. A typical walk up the aisle to receive communion is more exciting than this movie.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> This is what Transformers might have looked like without the giant robots, if Megan Fox had an IQ above 85 and if the Decepticons were electing a new Pope.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Like 'Code,' 'Angels' is filled with such far-fetched story lines that you'll be instantly drawn in or dismiss this as another convoluted film from Ron Howard.

770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> At least the movie's good for about 30 minutes of unintentional laughter, which doesn't say much for the other 90-plus minutes.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Angels & Demons has some exciting sequences, a spectacular ending with a terrific twist and a grounding in the debate about science versus religion that could hardly be more timely.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Angels and Demons is a truly handsome production, seamlessly mixing real locations with beautifully detailed sets. There are a few good performances here, and some thrills. Yet there's a flatness to the plotting.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The Da Vinci Code, while not a great movie by a stretch, was better and actually offered some interesting characters.

770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Howard, however, doesn't go much beyond Langdon running and talking and thinking and running.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Try not to giggle when...Langdon is being called in for "[his] expertise, [his] erudition." The guy from Bachelor Party? Just kidding, Tom, we love you--just not in this kind of pricy but conspicuously soulless crap.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A clunky movie with awful dialogue and a more-convoluted-than-it-needs-to-be plot.

770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Howard seems to count on audience goodwill toward Hanks carrying over to Langdon, filling in the hero's many blanks.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Presumably in response to criticism that The Da Vinci Code was static and talky, director Ron Howard has made Angels & Demons frantic %u2014 and, well, talky
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> ... Moves quickly but never involves the audience.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Both Da Vinci Code and its sequel are talky affairs, but Angels & Demons talks and runs simultaneously, making it the better match of material and intended audience.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> For sheer off-the charts looniness, it'll be hard to top the furious plot and flabbergasting climax of Angels and Demons ...
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> In Angels & Demons, the filmmakers expend a lot of time, craft and energy just to keep a potboiler at low-to-medium boil.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It's entertaining enough for what it is, but like the book from which it was adapted, Angels and Demons is light beach reading (or summer viewing), not meant to satisfy your artistic soul.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Angels & Demons is better than The Da Vinci Code and if you're a fan of the books you'll probably enjoy it - otherwise%u2026 I suppose there are worse ways to kill a couple of hours.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Maybe Howard and Hanks should have uttered a few 'Hail Marys' before filming?
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Given that it combines religious, scientific, political, art historical and academic lunacy in one package, Angels & Demons is at least more entertaining than the dreary, talky Da Vinci Code.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Angels and Demons is talky. Talky, Talky, Talky, Talky. You'd swear it was an entire pack of PhDs' dissertations spread out over two plus hours of endless yakking
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.333333333333 <###> The re-creation of St Peter's and the Sistine Chapel on the Hollywood backlot is a production achievement, yet the movie's about as exciting as looking over someone's shoulder while they finish a crossword.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.87 <###> ...also about antimatter, which is like the opposite of matter, which I guess means that it doesn't matter, just like Hitchock's famous Mac-Guffin, except that it blows up real good.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Tension? Believability? Characters we care about? Vanished, like so many well-intentioned prayers at an Easter Sunday mass.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Mindful of the religious storm which The Da Vinci Code stirred up, Angels & Demons, like Langdon's newly tidy locks, is as demure as a monk on retreat, almost to the point of anonymity.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> This graceless and overwrought piece of storytelling will probably earn a Pope's ransom at the box office, despite its many flaws.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> ...a minor improvement over its underwhelming predecessor...
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> If the film is never quite as inert as The Da Vinci Code, I hesitate to call this a thriller. It's big, bombastic and glossy - but it is also stiff and sometimes ludicrous.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> What pleasures there are in Brown's orgy of Catholic intrigue could only be called accidental, and tend towards the guilty - you may want to take a whip.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> So the film isn't entirely without faults, and those of the faith will pick many holes in it. But I was entertained, and I may even read the book.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> With such guiltily enjoyable hokum as a Dan Brown page-turner, you wonder what would have happened if someone actually had fun with it and, maybe, let us have some too. By treating trash as art, they've really taken the thrill out of this thriller.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Angels & Demons never really wants to admit that it's an absurd folly masquerading as a high-brow thriller, but it's marginally more dynamic than its predecessor and will probably pass time reasonably well as in-flight entertainment.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Avoiding the pitfalls of The Da Vinci Code, the eventful follow-up makes plenty of its own mis-steps. We now have renewed respect for the corny, endearingly unpretentious National Treasure movies.

770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> After the weight of expectation awaiting The Da Vinci Code, this is a more enjoyable affair and relaxed affair - a sort of National Treasure for grown-ups.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Admittedly implausible and a bit confusing, it is, nevertheless, enthralling - with enough unexpected twists to keep you on the edge-of-your-seat.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Atoning for The Da Vinci Code's cardinal sin - thou shalt not bore - this superior sequel zips along at such a lick you can almost forget the story is utter bollocks. At this rate, The Lost Symbol should be a doozy.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> This isn't a bad film at all, but it could be better... and I am very aware that regardless of what I think it will be huge.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.0 <###> This is a terrible movie with barely concealed contempt for its audience. Please don't go to see it - or another of these calamities may be along next summer.

770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> The film could have been a lot worse. Director Ron Howard has ejected some of the book's more outlandish twists and tells the story at such a swift pace that it is impossible to be bored.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Ron Howard directs a pell-mell script (David Koepp, Akiva Goldman) with more agility than he showed in Code. Though the story suffers intermittent daftness.

770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.2 <###> You most likely won't go to Hell for watching this film, though you will no doubt feel as if you are in Hell while watching it.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> Angels & Demons only exemplifies the problems with both movies and, thanks in part to a headsmacker of a third act, winds up being worse than its predecessor.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> If you liked the book, you're going to love the movie.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.25 <###> If the story isn't nearly as ridiculous as Da Vinci's, director Ron Howard still impeccably maintains the series's turgid mediocrity.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Angels & Demons is better, though not by much, than 2006's Da Vinci Code. The story, however, is less interesting and even more far-fetched.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Like its predecessor, Angels & Demons manages the miraculous feat of seeming to plod while racing at breakneck speed, the tempo set by Hans Zimmer's blusterous score.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Without pretensions to profundity, the movie can be enjoyed for the hell-raising hooey it is.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> This movie takes preposterousness to new levels; there are times when the proceedings become so ludicrous that one is tempted to laugh aloud at the sheer audacity of the plotting.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Angels & Demons slips away pretty quickly after you've watched it, in the way of most blockbuster movies, but it's diverting enough while it lasts.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Ultimately, the film tries so hard to strike a balance that it ends up standing stock-still.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Even though the sluggish Da Vinci Code is an easy act to follow. There's not a moment of inspiration on display here, but ample craft and professional technique.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Like The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons is a smoke-and-mirrors shadow play of half-truths, a synthesis of pseudo-history and pseudo-science. But this time, the Apollo 13 director achieves liftoff.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Nail-biting, God-fearing and unfolding at a breakneck pace -- a little like The Da Vinci Code on celestial speed -- ultimately everything wilts under the weight of the complicated story lines of its many saints and sinners.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> It's too lurid, too long. Too much is telegraphed.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Though complete redemption of Brown's fiction may not be possible, Howard's new film at least represents an upgrade from a mortal to a venal movie sin.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> The plotting here is so convoluted and so far-fetched that it makes the conspiracy elements in the National Treasure movies look plausible by comparison.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Here we go again...
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The result is dizzying enough to make you think you're entertained, although the moment you stop to think about Angels & Demons for even a second, the movie becomes ridiculous and preposterous enough to be laughed off the screen.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Howard simply isn't as good a filmmaker as Brown is a blissfully terrible writer.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Languid, over-bloated, preachy and too reliant on coincidence. Sometimes comes off as a pushy lecture produced and directed by Kirk Cameron.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A film entitled Angels & Demons, touting a challenge between religion & science in the name of the "Illuminati" should be more illuminating than a simple puzzle.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> never comes close to duplicating the urgent pacing of Brown's crackling source material
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Still, even if the whodunit aspect of Angels would barely pass muster on Scooby-Doo, this Ron Howard-directed sequel is less howlingly moronic than its predecessor.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Howard's fluid camera movement, Salvatore Totino's old master-ly cinematography, and the Gregorian rants of Hans Zimmer's score cannot redeem the Hardy Boys plotting of Dan Brown's source material.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> You won't remember many of the stops after the movie ends, but at least you'll enjoy the ride.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> Angels & Demons, without being particularly good, is nonetheless far less hysterical than The Da Vinci Code.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.55 <###> Much easier to sit through than the stultifying THE DAVINCI CODE. In fact, the pace could almost be considered breakneck, especially for a movie where someone is always stopping to deliver a lecture on history, art or symbology.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> The only thrill here comes from the adrenaline kick of the chase. Alas, it's an empty, Pavlovian kick at best.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The problem here, as in The Da Vinci Code, is that the puzzles don't invite the viewers' involvement.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> This kind of film requires us to be very forgiving, and if we are, it promises to entertain. Angels & Demons succeeds.

770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Too many astonishingly obscure variables fall into place for this film to be believed.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> At its best, Angels & Demons is backpacker porn, taking in a whole lot of Ron Howard's digitally rendered Rome--the streets, basilicas and museums--without the long line-ups tourists usually face and having the benefit of a pulse-racing conspiracy.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.375 <###> The team behind "The Da Vinci Code" returns to the ecclesiastic trough with this Vatican-based hooey that plays more like a Roman travelogue.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Behind the camera director Howard keeps the action moving, at the same time painting a glowing postcard of the sights of the Vatican.

770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> The film is wildly, recklessly improbable from start to finish - in fact, it's utter nonsense. But it's entertaining nonsense, and it's very well made in classical style.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> A fast-paced and serviceable thriller, dressed in second-hand religious mumbo jumbo, that relies on constant forward momentum to ensure its audience doesn't have time to stop and think about it too much.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.7 <###> By paying less respect to Dan Brown's novel, Ron Howard has made Angels & Demons a more entertaining film than his plodding treatment of the author's Da Vinci Code.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> the good news is that [Hanks]has worked through whatever issues that resulted in the questionable hairdo he sported in The Da Vinci Code
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The perfect summer entertainment, an exhilarating, heart-stopping thriller that doesn't let up for a minute.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.59 <###> Despite its lofty aspirations, Angels & Demons is no less artificial and forced than the latest Fast & Furious sequel. Different target audience, same motive: easy money.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.5 <###> How dark the con of Ron that he can so vividly simulate thought in what is truly an intellect-free enterprise.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> It's doesn't quite pay off, but Angels & Demons does a much better job of balancing the blasphemy and blood, heresy and heroics that were Brown's ticket to eternal wealth if not eternal life.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Credit where it's due: Director Ron Howard, also back from Da Vinci, keeps things moving fast enough -- the clock is ticking, after all -- that you don't linger over the implausibility of the story.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.625 <###> A one-dimensional affair loaded with commonplace distractions that never catch fire.

770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Remaining faithful to stronger source material makes Ron Howard and Tom Hanks' second Dan Brown adaptation a far superior effort in every possible way.
770676132 <###> Angels & Demons <###> Mystery & Suspense;Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Angels and Demons performs a miracle. It makes 2 hours seem like 4 hours. Like a lot of religion itself, Angels and Demons should be so much more than it is.

770801286 <###> Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience <###> Musical & Performing Arts;Documentary <###> 0.5 <###> The film gets one star from me for the admirable brevity of its running time and another for the definite article in its title, seemingly an implicit promise that there will be no sequel.
770801286 <###> Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience <###> Musical & Performing Arts;Documentary <###> 0.4 <###> The attitude displayed by Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience back toward those fans comes across as a curious mixture of shameless pandering and discreet contempt.

770801286 <###> Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience <###> Musical & Performing Arts;Documentary <###> 0.2 <###> Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience isn't a movie so much as a devotional object, a kind of secular fetish designed to induce rapture.
770801286 <###> Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience <###> Musical & Performing Arts;Documentary <###> 0.5 <###> This movie spends too much time on stage, and not enough off.

And at 76 minutes, the movie is still too long.
770801286 <###> Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience <###> Musical & Performing Arts;Documentary <###> 0.6 <###> The brothers are no Beatles, but it won't matter to fans who'll just be happy to spend some concentrated time with their crushes.

770693315 <###> Dracula Has Risen from the Grave <###> Drama;Horror;Romance;Classics <###> 0.7 <###> The film props itself up mostly on [director] Francis's often-thrilling visual sense, and the visceral impact of the first and final scenes.
770693315 <###> Dracula Has Risen from the Grave <###> Drama;Horror;Romance;Classics <###> 0.875 <###> It's still a very solid Hammer Dracula film, but the slow, downward spiral away from quality would continue with the next entry in the series ...

439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It's not a crime to be silly, although the cast of The Pink Panther 2 dance perilously close to committing at the very least a misdemeanor.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Offers more of what was in the 2006 remake, which became a hit in spite of the chorus of film critics who pointed out that the movie was awful and then were roundly ignored by the public, which knows what it likes, thank you very much.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> ...more of the film's jokes fall flat than hit their mark...
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> Not funny, and certainly shouldn't be rated a kid-friendly PG either.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> There are some beautifully constructed, elaborately inventive sequences of mayhem involving sight gags; then there are the scenes in between, when people talk. These are mostly disappointing.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Steve Martin reprises his role as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau in this hideous sequel to a boring remake.

439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Much of the "comedy" in The Pink Panther 2 is a rehashing of the jokes from the first film.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Wasteful, unneeded sequel to Shawn Levy's already unnecessary 2006 remake/series reboot.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> It's been a long time (the 1980s, maybe?) since either Cleese or Martin was actually funny, but the director, Harald Zwart, compounds this by displaying zero sense of comedy, employing laboured visual gags and routines with no punch lines.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Comedy crime caper is more miss than hit.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> This revisiting of Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau catapults Martin so far beyond the pale of authentic comedy that there can be no hope of return.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> There is something depressingly old hat about the slapstick in The Pink Panther 2, a movie whose target audience appears to be tiny tots and those with a high tolerance for jokes about people falling over.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Not so much bad as it is unnecessary.

439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> Lots of visual gags, lame slapstick humour and hopefully no more sequels.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Steve Martin is back doing the fur-nay ack-saynt (now increasingly eun-fur-nay); and with this film he's very much channelling the spirit of the final Panther movies from the original series, when Peter Sellers had nothing to offer but despair.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> I laughed more times than I thought I would so that is a big improvement on the previous film which almost made my toes curl. It will keep the kids quiet over half term and it won't be the worst film you see this year.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> The most casually catastrophic addition yet to the 45-year-old franchise.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Steve Martin again steps into Peter Sellers's long-vacated shoes and finds his feet are so small he can't stand up to original bungling French cop Inspector Clouseau.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A mirthless shot in the dark that misses the target by some distance.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.166666666667 <###> Martin fumbles it from the off. And that, in a nutshell, is reason enough to avoid this as one might any other calamity.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Moronic, but even moronic humour can be passingly entertaining, in parts.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> The entire film is a tedious string of pratfalls.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Cheap-looking, and peddling a humour that charitable folks will call broad and the rest of us will call unfunny, Pink Panther 2 may still appeal to audiences in non-English-speaking countries where physical comedy in the Mr Bean mould prospers.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> 2009 will struggle to produce another comedy quite as bad as The Pink Panther 2.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The animated title sequence is fun. Besides one set-piece involving a burning restaurant, the rest of the movie isn't.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> In the interests of full disclosure, the 2006 version of The Pink Panther ranks amongst my three most excruciating cinema experiences of all time. This sequel is no better.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Possibly the most excruciating comedy of the year.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Lazy, poorly written and badly directed comedy that completely wastes its talented cast and doesn't have a single laugh in it.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> There are a few inspired lines of dialog and a couple of moments where the slapstick actually works, but this sequel to the surprisingly not-awful remake is strictly for kids.

439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> This sequel to Martin's dire 2006 not-a-remake requires an autopsy, not a review, to establish cause of death. To start with, Steve Martin simply does not understand Jacques Clouseau.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.39 <###> The Pink Panther 2 is like the meat that Jeff Goldblum sent through the teleporter in The Fly: looks familiar, tastes weird.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> Yes I know it's only February but I feel pretty confident in declaring this farce a solid lock for Worst Film of 2009.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> No movie is produced to lose money, but the new 'Pink Panther' films have no apparent reason to exist except to wring more dollars from an already throttled franchise...
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Has a few chuckles that would make a younger audience laugh but to experienced movie veterans, laughs are lacking.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Well, it's a step above the last one. I guess that's faint praise, but it's true.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> ...after a long week of financial worries, children worries, job worries, The Pink Panther 2 hits all the right notes and is an excellent 90-minute escape.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> While The Pink Panther 2 certainly has moments of hilarity, they are fewer and farther between this time.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> If you thought the first film was funny, you might get a kick out of this. If it was barely watchable to you, you'll want to run screaming from the theater on this one.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Martin dons silly costumes and then lets them do the work for him. An emerald green toreador costume can only do so much, however, even with the tassels
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It won't blow you away, but it's worth a few laughs.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Clouseau's sleuthing practices are so unbelievably absurd it's hard not to laugh.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> If The Pink Panther 2 can keep our kids laughing while giving them the same warm memories we associate with the best installments of the series, then it's still a success no matter how well it measures up to the original.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Remember when Martin was funny?
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Kids will love it, but this 'Panther' has drifted far from the smart farce it once was.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> One can only hope that something good is coming from all the bad movies that Steve Martin has been appearing in.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.35 <###> Only little kids will find it somewhat amusing, but everyone else will find it to be tedious, low on laughs and ultimately forgettable.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Perhaps it's finally time to let Clouseau retire. If the movies can't generate laughs, there's really no point to them at all.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Wasn't it bad enough the first time?

439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> None of it is memorable, though the audience it's aimed at will giggle at the adults gone goofy.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Recycling bins have fresher content than this listless exercise in check-the-boxes moviemaking.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> There's a sort of desperation at work here.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The film's director, Harald Zwart, has little grasp of timing, which is crucial in slapstick. The result is frantic activity with few payoffs.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Here's hoping Martin now moves on, perhaps to revive some other defunct franchise.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Another Steve Martin comedy, the same old question -- what happened?
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> As for Martin, he's never been less funny than he is here.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> It's an everything-including-the kitchen-sink comedy -- and the sink has rusty pipes.

439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Hoary slapstick routines, invariably rushed, are all there is in The Pink Panther 2.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> When The Pink Panther 2 repeats the "ham-bur-gare" gag from the first film, you know you're in for a long 90 minutes.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's pretty dumb, and it's predictable, and, a year from now, not many people will remember it.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> I laughed once, at an unexpected gag, involving a ricocheting bullet, that was a nice play on an old gunfighting cliche. The rest of the film was a slow-bleeding gut shot.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> For those looking for something for the kids in a Mr. Bean vein, there are worse things than Pink Panther 2. But the overall experience remains dispiriting to those of us who remember Peter Sellers.

439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.74 <###> Mr. Martin, it's perfectly all right to be serious and distinguished and write plays about Picasso, Einstein and bunny rabbits. You don't have to always be the wild and crazy guy!
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.1 <###> Be warned, The Pink Panther 2 will activate your gag reflex rather than tickle your funny bone.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> I would not recommend this film and hope the case of Pink Panther is closed for good.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> A film in which nothing particularly amusing happens unless the sight of a group of well-known performers squandering their talents in exchange for presumably hefty paychecks strikes you as the apex of contemporary comedy.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> It woulda been less insulting for Martin to dig up Peter Sellars' corpse, build a bone xylophone out of the skeletal remains, and bang out Henry Mancini's "Pink Panther" theme during the Super Bowl halftime show. Opie & Anthony were right...
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The Pink Panther 2 is an improvement over The Pink Panther, but that's kind of like saying your new boyfriend Bernie Madoff is an improvement over your last boyfriend, Jeffrey Dahmer
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> There is nothing remotely funny in this idiotic film. It's not a coincidence that MGM and Columbia waited until the dead of winter to release this bomb.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Devoid of laughs or suspense...

439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Although comic mayhem follows Martin's Clouseau everywhere, none of it is particularly funny.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Alas, the second time proves no charm for The Pink Panther 2, Steve Martin's latest flimsy attempt to resurrect Sellers' bumbling Inspector Clouseau for the 21st century.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Despite all the supporting star power, it's Martin's physical comedy that makes the movie.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> At no point in Pink Panther 2 does credible screenwriting or apparent direction allow for the sensation of spontaneity.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> In The Pink Panther 2 the cast sprints way, way out ahead of the material, and miles ahead of the director, Harald Zwart.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Martin's first Pink Panther actually tickled me. Sadly, this time, flat gags & off-color innuendoes double in quantity, while sincerely funny bits wane to a mere handful.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> A work of slapsticky, accent-y gar-bage, The Pink Panther 2 is so brainlessly uninventive that it actually seems determined to sully the legacy of Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers's original series.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Desperate and dreary, The Pink Panther 2 is an empty-souled star vehicle that hasn't a clue what actual wit and comic timing entail.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> [It's] admittedly funnier than the 2006 original. But that movie was so dispiritingly, soul-suckingly bad, there was nowhere left to go but up.

439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The actors are let down by the screenplay and direction, which don't really pop the supporting characters out into strong comic focus.
439092186 <###> Pink Panther 2 <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> ...somewhat less of a desecration of the memory of Peter Sellers than Martin's first outing as the bumbling French detective.

771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Alas, the hero is played by Vince Vaughn, a limited actor whose range extends from petulant to homicidal.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Vaughn delivers an unusually heartfelt performance, verging on self-deprecation (as opposed to the usual smugness) and it gives us hope that he's finally growing up.

771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Managing the same generous laughs and difficult shifts in tone (especially when we meet David's son Ryan), this seems to annoy purists due to the presence of Vaughn who, it's true, has been dire in some awful movies.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Aside from a couple sweet and heartfelt moments this movie is a total waste.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Delivery Man has charm to spare.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The film's premise could so easily have lent itself to very broad comedy, which would have been right inside Vince Vaughn's wheelhouse. Yet the movie takes a richer, more character-driven route, and Vaughn is clearly up to the challenge.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Delivery Man is a surprisingly heartfelt approach to a very funny premise; despite taking several unnecessary narrative detours along the way.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Vince Vaughn fails to deliver the comedy but he does atone somewhat with an emotional finish
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It's clear immediately that Delivery Man benefits substantially from star Vaughn's impressively (and surprisingly) subdued performance...
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Takes the term 'remake' to new levels of literalness and therefore complete, superfluous redundancy.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> If movies were buskers, Delivery Man would be a big dorky guy with a 'Free Hugs' sign.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The story, however, is as sweet as it ever was.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Has a message about family, connectivity and belonging but makes you slog down a long road of soppy, artificially sweet goop to get to it.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> So is there anything new we can learn from 'Delivery Man' that we didn't already learn in 'Starbuck?' I guess a lot of that hinges on how you feel about Vaughn.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Flaccid as a comedy and even more limp as a heart-warmer.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> "Man" fails to Deliver
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> A high-concept situation, and potentially a complex, fascinating study of how family and children shape a life for both good and ill. His life has become a Benetton ad.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Softer and schmaltzier than the original. Vince Vaughn has played this guy before, to better effect.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> That one of [Vaughn's] first episodes involves a junkie daughter who ODs is a sign that the drama-comedy mix is way more off than expected.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Has Vince Vaughn peaked? While "Delivery Man" isn't his re-breakout role and it's not in nearly the same comedic league as its "Starbuck" inspiration, the film does show you a lesser-seen side: his drama instead of his comedy.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Calling Delivery Man a "comedy" is a bit of a stretch, because it's rarely funny. Dumb, yes, but not in a way that's worthy of more than a half-hearted chuckle.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Delivery Man's competent mix of humor and drama offers a mostly fun and even heartfelt movie experience - one that is neither laugh-out-loud or particularly insightful.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Scott passes the test. Delivery Man delivers, but just. Hopefully his future American endeavours recapture more of the spark that got him here.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Predictable. Yes. However, in spite of a zillion flaws, Delivery Man manages to deliver.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Instant fatherhood comedy features unexpected heavy moments.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.49 <###> Spending its climax making overtures about risking it all without ever taking a chance itself, Delivery Man ultimately completes its own arc from laziness into outright gutlessness.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Even noting the toned-down performance of Vaughn and the film's overall amiability, there are some creepy and unexplored issues lurking in the margins of this story that can't be brushed away.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The flat, scrubbed-looking film barely does anything with this premise.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Delivery Man can be pegged as yet another in a seemingly endless series of Apatow-era man-child redemption stories ...
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> ...slight but feel-good entertainment. It probably should have gone right to Lifetime in the first place...
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> "Starbuck" was a funny and warm-hearted trifle. So is "Delivery Man."
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> It's not that the movie is totally terrible, it's just incredibly misguided.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Vaughn never quite convinces as the perpetual slacker in this blue-collar family (he doesn't even look like he's from the same gene pool) and too many of the characters feel puppeteered into place; you can see all the strings.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Ken Scott's uneven story suffers through its narrative stumbles, but it overcomes its flaws thanks to an embraceable dose of heart and the loveable-lump charisma of Vaughn.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> We speed from one story to the other to the other like a fat guy at a Chinese buffet. We should be savoring some of this, instead of trying to cram it all in.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Delivery Man, with its democratic band of half-siblings and its feel-good view of humankind, is what it is: a reproductive remake that will make you laugh. More than once or twice.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Vince Vaughn can be a ray of sunshine in even the worst movies (see "Be Cool" for the best example of this). Here, I just didn't buy him as a loveable sad-sack.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Delivery Man isn't technically a shot-for-shot remake, but the movie is one in spirit.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Vince Vaughn does what he can to shine in Ken Scott's Delivery Man, but the film's lack of heart and soul is too much to overcome.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A moderately affecting heart tugger about the joys of parenthood and the need for stricter regulations on sperm banks
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> "Delivery Man" is nowhere near the worst film of 2013, but it is definitely the most exhausting.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This holiday season it's Vince Vaughn who stretches his abilities to a new limit; and while the result may not be the funniest or most touching film to come along, it will at least bring in everyone in your family for a couple of hours.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's a concept that could easily rely on being a gross-out laugh fest and be satisfied; luckily this movie also includes some heartfelt moments and reveals a side of Vaughn that we haven't seen in his recent fare.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Delivery Man is funny, sweet and surprising.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Had they kept Vince Vaughn properly restrained, he may have delivered exactly what the role required. As it is, they gave him too much rope, and the movie suffers because of it.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Delivery Man is desperately trying to retrace the same route as its predecessor, but even with the same road map and driver, this big-budget meat wagon never reaches the same destination.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The concept's execution is sloppy, full of inconsistencies and plot holes. The situations teeter on funny, but never achieve it. And sections meant to be heartwarming feel lukewarm, far-fetched or inappropriately comical.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> [An] overly sweet but heart-tugging comedy.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> If the movie had embraced its farcical side, I would have been happy to roll with it. But every time it tried to be serious, it revealed lapses of logic that I couldn't get past.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> "Delivery Man" offers a kinder, gentler Vince Vaughn in a pleasantly ramshackle comedy several rungs below his usual fare in both budget and high-concept assault tactics.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> The low-key appeal of the original is replaced here by aggressive mugging, a rinky-dink "funny" score, fake uplift and an overall air of feeble banality.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> In almost every way, the original is a better movie.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's hard to tell the same joke twice. There's really just one too many offspring in this scenario, and it's Delivery Man.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> This movie may not be groundbreaking, but it does enable Vaughn... to break out of his comedy acting rut and become the put-upon character rather than the put-uponer one.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A movie banging the drum of humanism, togetherness and uplift is hard to sneer at for too long. Also, there are some quality jokes.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Delivery Man has sentiment and affability embedded in its DNA, but Scott and Vaughn don't do enough to nurture the film to its full potential.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Vaughn is one of those actors who tends to autopilot his way through too many mediocre projects. When he goes all in, though, it's impossible to resist his charm.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Basically a kinder, gentler Vince Vaughn movie for people who don't like Vince Vaughn movies, "Delivery Man'' trades the abrasive comedian's trademark snark for schmaltz - an experiment that actually works better than you'd guess.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> "Delivery Man" is stuck in the tow-away zone.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The rhythm of the picture feels predetermined by the original, and you can tell, even if you haven't seen "Starbuck."
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> With its laughs few and far between, "Delivery Man" is simply, sadly, not that funny. Or original.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> With its edges sandpapered smooth, the story about an affable loser discovering he has fathered 533 children is rendered ludicrously feel-good and nonsensical.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Delivery Man is one joke stretched to the breaking point. Mine was reached.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Stop trying to make sperm bank comedies happen.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Benefits from the estimable comic instincts of Vince Vaughn. It's just too bad that the movie around him is squishy.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The schlubby, aw-shucks look on Vaughn's face in the omnipresent Delivery Man ads tells you everything you need to know about the ooey-gooey direction in which the film is headed.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Amusing and compassionate, this frothy, feel-good comedy celebrates an unconventional concept of family.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Inferior to the French Canadian original film, but watchably winning.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The kind of Ultra-Lite-Capraesque schmaltz you're supposed to go torpid with at a Sunday matinee, surrounded [by] parents who are probably thanking god that they only have 2.5 kids.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> The breadth of Vince Vaughn's gregarious persona has never been given free reign by any director and this certainly isn't the game-changer.
771320475 <###> Delivery Man <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> If this remake of 2011's French-Canadian hit Starbuck feels as if it's just going through the motions, Vaughn himself radiates sincerity and good intention. The actor doesn't get it right this time, but he's earned himself another chance.
771031757 <###> Falling Through <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.63 <###> Good action thrillers are difficult to come by and Falling Through is a well-meaning effort that's held back by significant problems.
771378844 <###> The Search For General Tso <###> Documentary <###> 0.875 <###> Keeps digging and digging until it has not only solved the enigma of this particular dish but cast a light on an entire secret chronology of food, immigrant culture, and the way the two amplify each other.
771378844 <###> The Search For General Tso <###> Documentary <###> 0.75 <###> Cheney (who worked on the unforgettable "King Corn"), obviously had a good time collecting their testimony, though he tends to side with the idea that the only authenticity is deliciousness.
771378844 <###> The Search For General Tso <###> Documentary <###> 0.75 <###> At just over an hour, it's a surprisingly satisfying and tasty dish for anyone looking for something a bit less bland than the typical history documentary.
771378844 <###> The Search For General Tso <###> Documentary <###> 0.7 <###> The Search For General Tso reveals everything you need to know about the Americanized dish, tempting your tastebuds while sneakily teaching a history lesson or two along the way.

771378844 <###> The Search For General Tso <###> Documentary <###> 0.821 <###> Surprisingly insightful, suspenseful and amusing. You'll never look at General Tso's Chicken the same way again.
771378844 <###> The Search For General Tso <###> Documentary <###> 0.75 <###> You may well emerge from "The Search for General Tso" with a hankering for the titular spicy dish.
771378844 <###> The Search For General Tso <###> Documentary <###> 1.0 <###> The cinematic equivalent of an entertaining encyclopedic entry about the most irresistible offering on today's Chinese takeout menu!
771378844 <###> The Search For General Tso <###> Documentary <###> 0.75 <###> This is an unlikely subject for a movie but a strangely beautiful one, hitting poignant notes on a cross-country journey to restaurants in big cities and small towns, all in a bid to understand where this dish came from and what it represents.
771378844 <###> The Search For General Tso <###> Documentary <###> 0.625 <###> Director Ian Cheney doesn't delve too deeply into the possibly unsettling questions the documentary raises about society at large.
771378844 <###> The Search For General Tso <###> Documentary <###> 0.9 <###> The only problem I had with The Search for General Tso, and it's something many of us experience eating Chinese-American food, was that an hour after watching it I was hungry to view it again.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.4 <###> Its grindhouse appeal will be enough for some audiences, but I sometimes require more of a statement to be made other than "It hurts when outback psychopaths stab you a bunch."
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.5 <###> John Jarratt is as magnificent as ever as the disgustingly gruesome Mick Taylor, but Wolf Creek 2 is mostly very predictable and a disappointing sequel to what was otherwise an incredibly daring original film.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.25 <###> "Wolf Creek 2" isn't much different than "Wolf Creek," but it is markedly worse.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.5 <###> A fast-moving, lean killing machine that will delight genre fans.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.6 <###> As well made as it is, it would be great to see what McLean could do if he were free from genre conventions and could put his many talents to use in a movie not built around beheadings and dismemberments.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.4 <###> Offers little in the way of new thrills.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.375 <###> While Creek has some notable frights reminiscent of the 2005 original, this version tries too hard to create a franchise-able serial killer from Down Under, a Mad Max with a machete.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.4 <###> This Creek has run dry.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.625 <###> There are cheap shocks in the film, but there are also terrifying moments that poetically command our empathy.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.3 <###> A tired, unwanted sequel that should have been left Down Under.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.85 <###> Wolf Creek ramped up to that relentless third act; Wolf Creek 2 begins at that third act and remains as relentless as ever.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.5 <###> Wolf Creek 2 does all it can to paper over the fact that it shouldn't exist, but the film severely diminishes the integrity of the first Wolf Creek by turning Mick into a cartoon icon, more Outback legend than man.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.75 <###> A 106-minute game of cat and mouse where no one is safe, Greg McLean's second installment is fearless in the depths it plunders, very, very nearly matching the original in terms of its disturbing vitality and ultimate prolonged urgency.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.7 <###> This film turns its satire on the loveable serial killing rogue archetype, something that it seems some genre fans find harder to swallow.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.8 <###> Wolf Creek 2 is the ferocious kick in the ass that the slasher genre needs right now - bloody, brutal, and lead by a slasher icon in Mick Taylor that rivals the most memorable horror villains produced in the last decade.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.8 <###> 'Wolf Creek 2' is an insanely fun, yet dirty, grimy and vicious slasher massacre.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.6 <###> It's entertaining enough if all you require is a dash of gore and a few one liners, but this wolf has lost its bite.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 1.0 <###> WOLF CREEK 2 is just the crazy ride one hopes for in this ever affective horror genre but it's the pervasive satire that you absorb in this vulnerable state that leaves an indelible mark.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.65 <###> Wolf Creek 2 is never anything less than entertaining, but those looking for the gnawing tension of the original might be disappointed by lack of any real character development and a pantomime-inspired Mick Taylor.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.4 <###> This critic's eyebrows were raised more for the inclusion of Rolf Harris' Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport than for any would-be chills, which bizarrely fail to materialise.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.7 <###> A killer film and very satisfying, Wolf Creek 2 is also, hopefully, a sign of a healthy film industry, one buoyant enough to produce crowd-pleasing sequels from crowd-pleasing originals. No shame in that.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.4 <###> Trades the raw, taboo-shattering violence of its predecessor for a cheaper, more predictable yet somehow nastier kind of carnage.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.4 <###> Mclean injects the grimmest of grim humour into the mix (including a bizarre reference to the Rolf Harris classic Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport), and I imagine Quentin Tarantino is one of the movie's biggest fans. But the end result is manipulative and ugly.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.7 <###> This is the most notable home-grown fiction feature to hit cinemas since P.J. Hogan's Mental.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.6 <###> Mclean has made a lean and mean genre film that cranks the dial to eleven.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.25 <###> After this cruddy display, all the bonus points Jarratt has racked up from Quentin Tarantino's misplaced man-crush on him are gone.
771363583 <###> Wolf Creek 2 <###> Horror <###> 0.8 <###> Wolf Creek lived [to be reviled]. I'm pleased to report Wolf Creek 2 is even more loathsome; detestable and disgusting in all the right ways.

769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> The weight of expectation should have crushed this movie.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Nolan has squeezed enough material for a saga into two and a half hours. The action moves insanely fast, the exposition is breathless, and the big setpieces practically tread on each other's heels. Down time doesn't exist in this film.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> The Dark Knight is a triumph from beginning to end.

769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> The Dark Knight takes the process a giant leap further, transforming a typical summer blockbuster into a brooding, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil.

769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> If Batman Begins was the classy hors d'oeuvre in Christopher Nolan's blockbuster trilogy, then this awesome follow-up is a main course that delivers on all levels.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Nolan's Dark Knight constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events.

It's an electrifying, thought-provoking meditation on the modern wages of fear. And you haven't danced with the devil by the pale moonlight until Heath Ledger has taken your psyche for a twirl.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Whatever the causes, the effects of The Dark Knight are subtle and powerful. It's rejuvenating, it renews the faith.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> The setting may be Gotham City, but the landscape is that of the unconscious, where archetypes roam unfettered by the restraints of the waking world.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> Locked in a struggle for Gotham's soul, this Batman and Joker are mesmerizing, unforgettable and, yes, complete.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> The Dark Knight should not be remembered as the movie that took Heath Ledger out. Thanks primarily to him, it should be remembered as the movie that propelled fantasy action-thrillers to a higher level.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> I'm tired of the early Oscar talk too, but when you're talking the best performance in years, if not decades, it's worth talking about. The whole movie is worth the buzz. Christopher 'Slowly Revealing Myself To Be God' Nolan has done it again.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> This film is not only one of the year's best; it may well end up as the finest of 2008. At the very least, it deserves consideration for Best Picture and Best Director, along with the expected Oscar kudos for Ledger.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> See this one on the biggest screen you can (IMAX, ideally), and experience both the magic of top-notch technical filmmaking and the bittersweet pleasure of watching a young actor, gone too soon, giving a performance that won't be forgotten.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> The Dark Knight is better than you have heard and as good as you had hoped.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> You come away impressed, oppressed, provoked, and beaten down, holding on to Ledger's squirrelly incandescence as a beacon in the darkness.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Batman's dilemma in The Dark Knight is how to use his bad press, whether he will embrace it or continue to fight it.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> The Dark Knight resounds with a throbbing topical undercurrent, its superficially good-versus-evil setup slowly revealed to be a complex examination of the ways in which democracies can, and must, combat zealotry.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Ledger's Joker sports greasy, green-tinged hair and a permanent slouch. It's as if he had bad posture as a kid and things only got worse from there.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> My question is can a third episode -- one lacking the unforgettable, superlative performance of Heath Ledger -- possibly top the magnificence of The Dark Knight? I predict a very interesting Oscars next year.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> flat-out exhilarating, a roller-coaster plunge into the heart of darkness... and a tad exhausting
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> Nolan has shown a new way to tell a superhero story, and it may turn out to be the only way to tell a story about heroes in this troublingly amoral time.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> I have no idea if Ledger will win the Oscar next year. James Dean didn't. However both men left us, albeit too soon, with performances that will endure forever.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> A great work of contemporary cinema and easily the most artistically significant film ever made to ever inspire its own fast-food pizza tie-in.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> The most brilliantly complex, perfectly paced, nerve-jangling, moral-wrangling film ever based on a graphically detailed literary work and, dare I say, one of the most important American films to be made in years.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Mixing bravura filmmaking with flat cliches in about equal amounts, The Dark Knight is all about dualism. Appropriately, the movie's half-inspired, half-frustrating.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Shakespearean but overlong, The Dark Knight is two hours of heady, involving action that devolves into a mind-numbing 32-minute epilogue.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> It's still too long, especially for a comic-book movie. But with Ledger's last performance director Nolan was blessed with the gift of light.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Ledger's mesmerizingly damaged agent provocateur is the film's dark heart, a presence so malevolently unpredictable that it remains palpable even when he's not on screen.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> Whatever trepidations Ledger may have had about taking on such an iconic role, he blows past them brilliantly, carrying The Dark Knight along with him.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> A thought-provoking morality tale about the descent into darkness of a vigilante superhero, an anarchistic and sadistic villain, and an ardent idealist whose dreams are shattered.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Nihilistic, imaginative and emotionally gratifying, The Dark Knight is in many ways a groundbreaking triumph, and perhaps the best superhero film to date.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> It's jam-packed with flawlessly designed set-pieces and skullduggery, sure, but it's also shrouded in grim portent, overlaid with a filigree of despair, and, for good measure, covered in a patina of dire consequence.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> As much as this is Ledger's movie, that should not diminish the notable accomplishments of other key cast members.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Christopher Nolan wanted to make an action movie that was different from other action movies -- darker, more twisted, more despairing, more bleak -- and he has mostly succeeded in this latest Batman installment. He can thank Ledger for a lot of that.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> This is not merely a Batman movie. It is not merely a comic-book movie. It is not merely gripping summer entertainment. It is, with Wall-E, one of the two best mainstream films to be released all year and far and away the most hypnotic chiller.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> It's a comic-book movie, but it's also a dark and highly complex drama.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Nolan hasn't simply made a popcorn movie for brainiacs. He's an increasingly self-assured director of action sequences.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> The Dark Knight is a good -- not great -- superhero movie that crams as many ideas into its 2 1/2 hours as it can and still be considered a summer action picture.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> Among this summer's action films, Dark Knight is easily the best in show.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> From its grim palette to its wonderfully eerie score, a departure from what Hollywood has always told us a superhero film should be ... Complex, unsettling, and rewarding.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Let it be said that [Ledger's is] such a fearless, fierce, menacing turn that comparisons with Jack Nicholson don't come into it. This is the definitive Joker.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> The Dark Knight is ahead of the curve, dense and demanding, an art film on a grand scale. It won't make you smile, but it will make you ponder this mesmerizing experience.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Nolan paints an inky portrait of a city falling apart, and in a movie rife with two-faced masquerading freaks, the Joker is merely the least conflicted of the bunch. Ledger's work is improbably droll, impossibly creepy, meticulously detailed.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Twisted, tortured, terrifying -- and terrific.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Ledger slips into the purple suit as if it were an animal skin for a primal, archetypal dance...Nolan's richly realized adaptation of a modern American mythology fulfills our faith in the material and its interpreters.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Iron Man and even more so The Dark Knight move the genre into deeper waters. They realize, as some comic-book readers instinctively do, that these stories touch on deep fears, traumas, fantasies and hopes.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Analyzing the successes of such a blistering, genre-defining masterwork (I'm already slipping) is tantamount to judging the contours of Michelangelo's David or evaluating the shading and form of Da Vinci's The Last Supper.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> From the start, it drags us down to the fiery pits of Gotham's anarchic hell and never lets us up for air; it is a bruising, unrelenting slice of sensory overload, a captivating spectacle as likely to dazzle the eyes as fray the nerves.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> Freed from the confines of an origin story, director Christopher Nolan lets loose with an intense, challenging, flawed and, yes, dark vision of Gotham under siege, featuring an unforgettable final performance by Heath Ledger as the clown prince of crime.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Plodding, puffed-up kitsch mistaking itself for profound psycho noir that the source material won't support.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> It's an action-filled crime drama revolving around a dangerous, demented anarchist. Once again, the Joker's wild!

769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> Batman takes a fierce stance in favor of untruth, surveillance and (but?) the American way. Bruce Wayne says, 'Batman has no limits,' and there are two sides to that coin.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> While The Dark Knight has all the visual flair and breathtaking action sequences you'd want in this kind of movie, the screenplay by Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan keeps the human element front and center.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> The Dark Knight is 152 minutes long but is transfixing and all-enveloping, rather than arduous.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> It's proof that popcorn entertainments don't have to talk down to their audiences in order to satisfy them. The bar for comic-book film adaptations has been permanently raised.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Holy hyperbole, Batman! The best superhero movie ever is also the best movie of the year so far.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Nolan has provided movie-goers with the best superhero movie to-date, outclassing previous titles both mediocre and excellent, and giving this franchise its Empire Strikes Back.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Dark Knight is I suppose the greatest superhero movie ever made, but it's so far beyond the genre that attempting to compare it with likes of Spider-Man, is almost laughable.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> This movie is too in love with itself to make you love it.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> I loved The Dark Knight... It's unbelievably dark and uncompromised; it's the film noir we deserve for our terrifying 21st century.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> Daring and uncompromisingly different from previous incarnations of Batman, Nolan hasn't redefined the superhero genre as much as created an unforgettable piece of crime fiction within the context of that realm.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.95 <###> A dark, ambitious, mature and gritty crime saga the likes of which Michael Mann or Martin Scorsese would be proud to call their own.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> The film is quite special but where some films can weather extraneous or padded scenes, The Dark Knight has some distracting bloat to it which keeps it out of masterpiece territory.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Martin Scorsese's The Departed. Michael Mann's Heat. Brian de Palma's The Untouchables. And now, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight can join the list of one of the most absorbing and intense crime dramas in modern movie milestones.
769959054 <###> The Dark Knight <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> Nolan's sequel surpasses the original with an intense, disturbing masterpiece.

770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Jonze has created a world in which even "wild things" can be full of personality and fun to be around.

770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> This is not a coming-of-age film.

770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Uma especie de "Anticristo" Jr., o filme abraca o universo psicologico de seu protagonista como estrutura narrativa, levando o espectador para uma viagem por vezes perturbadora - mas sempre tocante - a psique de Max.
770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> The conversations and interactions [Jonze] orchestrates, whether real, imaginary, spoken with an inner voice, or cried aloud, are delivered with the unmistakable rhythm and in the grandiose rubber and glue terminology of children.

770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> 'Where the Wild Things Are' stands out for its unusually potent evocation of the timbre of childhood imagining, with its combination of the outre and the banal, grand schemes jumbled up with delicate feelings and the urge to smash things up.
770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Don't go expecting joyous escapism, but if you're interested in seeing melancholic auteur filmmaking, complete with a lush soundtrack... you won't see a more compelling film this year.
770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> It's all very charming and quirky...

770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Jonze's Wild Things is an altogether darker, colder picture: a film about the way children can lose their fear of the world only by losing their innocence.
770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Loud, narcotised, emotionally stunted, it's so eager to avoid the horrors of mainstream commodity culture that it concocts a defensive version of pre-adulthood.

770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Not as easy or airbrushed as Potter, Ice Age, or Narnia then, but with its darkness, loneliness, and wonder, it might be the most honest kids' film of the year.
770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> A poignant dissection of youth with nine-foot furry monsters, gorgeous production design, frenetic camerawork and a playful, wistful score from Karen O. Never mind the little ones. This beauty will have most grown-ups blubbing.
770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> In some respects, Jonze is the geek who never grew up: and with Where The Wild Things Are, he reminds us that the simple pleasure of childhood is running around and screaming with abandon.
770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> [Jonze's] take on Maurice Sendak's much-loved children's book does offer plenty of wildness and wackiness, although it's also unusually sombre.
770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Jonze has created one of the most offbeat, original and interesting films of the year.

770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Whereas many child actors make you feel a little bit sick, Records is astounding in the lead role.

770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> I have no idea what Jonze and Eggers are trying to say here, either to children or to adults, but it's difficult to imagine how they could have made a more tedious and exasperating attempt at it.

770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> The script is brilliant, lacing the dialogue with dark, melancholy humour and subtly ensuring that almost every line, visual or action on the island echoes something from Max's real life.
770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Jonze's inventive approach to Maurice Sendak's classic children's book continually confounds our expectations with an approach that's so offhanded and fresh that it might feel awkward or strange. But it's a real grower.
770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> From that belting opening shot to the emotional gut- punch of an ending, I was bewitched by it. In fact, Wild Things... I think I love you.

And paradoxically, it's also too child-like in its construction to be appreciated by most adults.
770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Imagination is the real star of Sendak's classic and Jonze and his co-writer, Dave Eggers, have expanded on its brief text to spin a story in which the tough and the tender smoothly coalesce.

770671948 <###> Where the Wild Things Are <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Comedy;Drama;Kids & Family;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> The fact that Jonze and Eggers are revealing so much of themselves in this emotionally crabbed tribute to the unending hell of childhood is itself reason to see the film.

770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Schwimmer completely lacks what it takes to ever get this movie off the ground.

770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> It's a Generation X movie in a way very few movies are any more; it is unseemly to admit that our generation is about as slackery as we had promised to become. Go with your ex and smile.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It's a good formalic romantic comedy. Nothing more.

770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> It's a lazy effort that offers little encouragement for the future of Schwimmer's directorial career.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It is neither as funny nor as wickedly subversive as 'Shaun of the Dead,' but it respects its characters enough to make them thoughtful and surprisingly complex, unlike the sitcom stereotypes inhabiting lesser romantic comedies.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Warm/funny film about a man trying to re-win his true love by running a race

770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Simon Pegg gives it the old college try, but his character isn't worthy our cheers. Maybe Pegg should resurrect his most famous character, the resourceful, much funnier Shaun, and do battle with the zombies of London rather than the marathon runners of Lo
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A fine work of craftspeople both in front of the camera and behind...whose chief mistake is that every one of them appears to have forgotten that it was in fact a comedy.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Neither original nor packed with surprises. It is, however, entertaining and thoroughly likable.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> When all is said and done, you're better off renting the Friends Season Four finale...That was brilliant. This is like a bad Farrelly Brothers movie.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Overcomes its occasional stumbles, thanks almost entirely to the charm of its cast...
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Seldom laugh-out-loud funny and the script doesn't have the witty insight of Pegg's last few films, but Pegg's bumbling charm is just enough to make this movie run.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.6875 <###> It's clear in the scene where they try to scam the marathon officials that Dylan Moran would be a good candidate to play the grown Harry Potter in the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows film. Somebody take note!
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Simon Pegg is a wonderful physical comedian. And he's able to take off with his talent in "Run Fatboy Run," a comedy that's not up to par of his other starring roles but one that nonetheless provides quite a few laughs.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> While some moments rely solely on Pegg's natural on-screen goofiness, he & M. I. Black have simply written a very funny script that spreads the fun evenly throughout.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Amiable. Bland. Cute. Formulaic. Inconsequential. Run Fatboy Run goes down with ease, but it's awfully slight.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> I wish the script credited to Michael Ian Black (The Pleasure of Your Company) and (Simon) Pegg had a little more intrigue along the way to its predictable finish.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A hackneyed slacker scenario reduces this film from an entertainment marathon to a plot treading water. The feel-good message comes around, but there is too much packaging for the product.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> [The movie] may not [provide] an onslaught of gut-busting laughs, but the humor that does come forth is heartier and more authentic.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> For his debut directing role, Schwimmers steers a safe "PG-13" date movie that roots for the underdog and has a good overall message.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It would have been funnier if, instead of Pegg, his frequent collaborator, Nick Frost had taken the role. Then we would have a film worthy of its name. And maybe even a few more genuine guffaws.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> One thing Schwimmer does do right is keep the story moving swiftly. You're in, you're out, no harm done -- unless you want that hour and a half back.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Amiable, consistently amusing and surprisingly affecting, it has the flavor of a Nick Hornby novel, with its focus on an overgrown boy struggling to grow up and be a man.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Run, Fat Boy, Run is the directorial debut of actor David Schwimmer, who is much better behind the camera than in front of it. Here, he's taken material best suited to sketch comedy and turned it into a feature of no small heart and humour.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Run Fatboy Run is largely content to follow the formula, guide us on a sunny tour of downtown London's tourist hot spots and transform Pegg from paunchy schlub to Runderella with a few decent laughs along the way.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Tere's nothing edgy or new about Run, Fat Boy, Run.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> This is a romantic comedy light on romance but heavy on comedy, and it's well cast to skew in that direction.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Enough already. I mean, I don't have anything against comedies about dopey guys who win the love of a good woman by competing in ridiculous Olympian contests. But if I wanted to see a really funny one, I'd rent a Rocky movie.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The kind of movie that's apt to be dismissed a goofy lark. It is that. But it's also a rare comedy that believes in its own message, and that could inspire the depressed and the demoralized to grit their teeth and keep running.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Thanks to a jaunty Brit-rock score and likable characters all around, the movie's easy to watch and occasionally pumps up the emotions.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> There's much too much of everything in Run, Fatboy, Run. Every ounce of comedy is so forced and full-on ridiculous that when characters express even a smidgen of sentiment, it feels like a parody.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The film is better than expected. It's directed with warmth, humor and intelligence.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Pleasant but unfocused, a romantic farce, trying very hard to be sweet when it needs to be a bit more cheeky.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The material isn't any more inspired than the protagonist is inspiring. Run, Fat Boy, Run should have been whipped into better shape before the starting gun sounded.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> While this movie lacks the screaming energy and consistency of Shaun of the Dead and his hysterical Hot Fuzz, Pegg is able to keep things interesting.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A movie that is smartly written, boasts plenty of funny lines and rides hard on Pegg's ability to look and act like the most stoically put-upon person on the planet.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> This is not a film with blazingly original ideas or a groundbreaking script - I guessed the ending before the movie even started - but it has a sweet nature, an abundance of laughs and plenty of Pegg to spare.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> From storyline to characterization to style of comedy, everything about the directorial debut of former Friends star David Schwimmer is a nod to accommodation, compromise and consensus.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Run, Fatboy, Run isn't going to win any prizes for fresh questions. But it's just fleet enough to hold its own in the middle of the pack.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Run Fat Boy Run might as well have been written by a rushed piece of software. The program calls for a surprise engagement, a street fight complete with crotch punches, an apartment eviction, and a runaway child -- all in about five minutes.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> For all its faults however, this is a romantic comedy that works - if just barely.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Run Fat Boy Run wouldn't make it to the finish line without Simon Pegg's winning performance.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> It runs out of steam - and you'll likely run out of interest - long before the finish line.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Outside of a couple of moments of self-conscious shock humor, the most surprising thing about the film is how square it really is.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Simon Pegg is almost brilliant with his slapstick comedy and dedication to goofiness.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> This brand of unfailing comic timing and expressive physicality is rare, and it's why Pegg, in particular, is a star. [Blu-ray]
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> ends up feeling like a boring limerick told over and over again.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Fatboy may be more welcome than the latest Matthew McConaughey-Kate Hudson vehicle, but only by a nose.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> While [Pegg] gets some mileage out of this sketchy material, he's undermined by story and character problems, as well as the limp, uninspired direction of actor-turned-filmmaker David Schwimmer.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The project represents an uncertain Britification of a script by Chicago native Michael Ian Black, and the result finds itself stranded somewhere out in the Atlantic, mid-crossing.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> So pathetically average that you can barely muster the energy to have an opinion about it.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Snarkiness and sentiment are in constant battle for supremacy throughout Run Fat Boy Run with no chance of a comfortable draw.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> [Director] David Schwimmer takes the sow's ear of a script given him by [Simon] Pegg and Michael Ian Black and deep-fries it into a burnt pork rind of a movie.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There are so many scenes of him running, it's surprising Pegg didn't just take off and never come back to the set after he saw how things were going.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Anyone hoping for the lean meat of the fast, furious, and riotously funny Shaun of the Dead or even the popcorn fancy of the lesser Hot Fuzz will do best to look elsewhere.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> It may be the kind of film that will make you smile more than laugh, but you'll smile a lot. And although it practically forces you to root for its hero, you won't mind a bit because the hero is played by Simon Pegg.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Pegg's Dennis is lazy, insensitive and unhygienic. Yet his most defining quality is blandness. I could barely rouse myself to dislike him.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Pegg is brilliant, pratfalling his way through heartbreak and indignity
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> This is yet another parody that falls victim to the desire to become what it's intending to satirize.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> A thin premise undermined by rampant stupidity at every turn.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Predictable losers-are-people-too jesting raised a notch by the quality work of consummate professionals.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Brit romcom mixes laughs with swearing, smoking.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It has meaning and sentiment and a nice pay-off for its finale. But without more laughs, Run Fatboy Run is awfully winded by the time it crosses the finish line.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The presence of Simon Pegg and Dylan Moran elevates what might have been merely a pleasant, harmless but ultimately forgettable romantic comedy.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Well enough crafted to keep you in stitches while on the edge of your seat for the duration, even if this laff-a-minute escape is more mindless than cerebral.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Run, Fat Boy, Run stays out of sitcom quicksand long enough to make you think that Schwimmer has a knack for this comedy-directing thing.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> This is an amiable film that will provoke some chuckles.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Using conventional slapstick gags and inventive crosscutting, David Schwimmer scores as a creditable, if not memorable, director...but the innocuous script is totally predictable.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> An unapologetic throwback to the days when comedies didn't have to be all that original -- just as long as they were funny.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Credit Pegg for inserting his smart brand of character-driven humor everywhere the script needed him (he polished up an old script by Michael Ian Black), and credit Schwimmer for keeping things moving quickly and efficiently.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Pacing and suspension of disbelief aside, I had fun with the heart-felt moments and the sheer comedy. Plus, ita(TM)s great to see Pegg jump out of his Edgar Wright-zone for a bit and try making a movie with a different group for a change.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Schwimmer and Pegg have scored a win--largely due to tasteful choices in the subplotting and providing such a rich ensemble to tickle the shenanigans to a higher level.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's not hysterically funny, but this British comedy is sharp enough to keep us chuckling right to the predictably sappy conclusion.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Formulaic and thoroughly conventional.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Seems to lack the aspirations necessary to overcome its failings.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> ...a mess of sentimental cliches...
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> ...excessive product-placement has turned the film into one enormous ad for Nike, with all the chilling humourlessness that this implies.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> An enjoyable if patchy and predictable ride, but Simon Pegg shows he's more than capable of going the distance.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Schwimmer often resists an easy laugh in favour of a poignant moment and thereby heightens the sense of urgency during Dennis' last dash for glory.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Pegg proves agreeable company in a lightweight Britcom whose biggest laughs emanate from its supporting cast.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> What should be dreadfully synthetic actually plays as a pleasant time-passer, thanks to a goodly supply of one-liners, and Pegg and Newton's facility for investing a string of hokey plot devices with genuine warmth. Formulaic, yet disarmingly enjoyable.
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Pegg pitched Shaun of the Dead as "Richard Curtis shot through the head." Run, Fat Boy, Run comes on more like "Richard Curtis kicked in the nuts" - a refreshingly honest Britcom that never really threatens the ribs but which is amiable company throughout
770670572 <###> Run Fatboy Run <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Enjoyable, sharply written and frequently hilarious comedy with strong comic performances from its cast. This should strike a chord with slightly overweight men everywhere.

771378336 <###> Before I Disappear <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> "Before I Disappear" suffers from a bland, disinterested tone. In the end, few will care when all of these people disappear.
771378336 <###> Before I Disappear <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> "Before I Disappear" wears its big, aching heart on its sleeve with a sincerity so unwavering that it's borderline goofy. And in a film about a burnout bonding with a cute kid, that lack of self-awareness proves critical.
771378336 <###> Before I Disappear <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> As a director, Christensen operates at two settings: Drippy Sentimentality and Miserablist Hopelessness.
771378336 <###> Before I Disappear <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> It's hard to take hectoring parent Emmy Rossum seriously, and there's too much troubling development tucked into a plot that already feels overextended. A surfeit of last-act explanations doesn't help either.
771378336 <###> Before I Disappear <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> An enchanting, gritty and funny short becomes a feature film with its charms intact.
771378336 <###> Before I Disappear <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> Even at its most compelling, it remains inconsistent and superfluous, a lesson that sometimes a movie can feel more fully formed in 19 minutes rather than 90.

771378336 <###> Before I Disappear <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Although Before I Disappear bears the undeniable stamp of padding, Christensen wisely expands on the kaleidoscopic energy of the short, not its formulaic underpinnings.
771378336 <###> Before I Disappear <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> The script is beautifully written with realistic dialogue that never misses a beat. Each actor works in sync with the others and all are outstanding.

10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Destined to go down in the history books as the Heaven's Gate of superhero flicks, this is nothing more and nothing less than an extraordinary waste of time and money.

10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> The premise of teaming up famous, disparate characters of classic fiction is a lot more intriguing than what ended up as the finished cinematic product.
10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> The more you think about the film, the more it falls to pieces. It's riddled with logistical and continuity errors that keep the audience continually uttering 'Huh?'

10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Part of the pleasure of the film is supposed to be the anachronisms. But most of the fun is in the first part of the film and the anachronisms long outlast the fun.
10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> a dull concoction of literary antiheroes that brings back unwelcome memories of torturous high-school English classes, where even bloodsuckers, shape shifters and buccaneers somehow managed to bore us to tears

10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> The movie is extraordinary mostly for the sheer wastefulness of it all, the work of little boys who've never outgrown their love of blowing things up.

10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> The film is decidedly more involving than [most of the other summer movie extravaganzas], holds more intriguingly original conceits, and--here's a refreshing change of pace--keeps its running time well below the two-hour mark.

10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> In the end, what's most extraordinary about Gentlemen is that despite its preposterous leaps of logic, it somehow still emerges as a reasonably entertaining summer blockbuster.

10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Most studios aim for movies, particularly summer movies, that can be enjoyed by both kids and their parents. LXG can be enjoyed by children and ... their grandparents.

10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.125 <###> Ill-conceived, sloppily directed, shoddily acted, LXG looks like the work of a confederacy of dunces.
10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Moore's dark vision has predictably been diluted for mass consumption, but that doesn't begin to explain why the disjointed storyline is so full of holes.

10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.125 <###> Suspension of disbelief is as necessary as popcorn when approaching a summer comic-book movie, but LXG is too preposterous even for this fantastical genre.
10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> In a summer of big-budget sequels, prequels, remakes and homages, no film is more ambitiously derivative -- or dramatically unsatisfying -- than Stephen Norrington's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.
10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> What starts out as a solid three-star outing devolves by the inevitable 'watch for the sequel!' ending into a one-star mess. I'll split the difference.
10319 <###> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> All in all, just another summer's day at the multiplex.

10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Black (who is also a musician in the rock band Tenacious D) makes the most of a role he was born to play, and plays it like a person possessed by the demons of rock 'n' roll.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> An embarrassing mess of poor jokes and mixed messages.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Escola de Rock ja havia acabado ha mais de meia hora quando percebi que continuava a sorrir - um sinal inequivoco de que o filme funcionara maravilhosamente bem.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Absolutely the funniest movie to hit theater screens in a good long while.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> It's irreverent without crossing the line, and hits a tender note without lapsing into maudlin sentiment.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> The School of Rock's Dewey Finn ... is the role Jack Black was born to play. His volume goes up to 11 -- and Black never turns it down.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> ... Black personally lends enough energy to the film to power a third-world country for a few years, and that's just with his eyebrows.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A breath of fresh air for Hollywood comedies, providing proof that intelligent comedies can still make money if they're made of the right ingredients.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> For a silly kids' comedy, this is exceptionally well-made.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Very much worth seeing.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Easily one of the funniest films of the year, thanks to a terrific script and a truly hilarious performance from comic powerhouse Jack Black.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It sounds like the sort of sanitized product that might star Eddie Murphy (Dokken Day Care?), yet what gives the movie any semblance of an edge is Jack Black.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> The movie rolls along with the attitude of children's classics like <i.The Bad News Bears, never talking down to the youngsters in the cast or the audience.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> This should really be a fish-out-of-water role, but Black will have none of that: he's a fish in the water, and he swims around in it with abandon.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Strong B+. I suppose the film is true to Rock 'n' Roll by being both fun and irresponsible.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The very anarchic spirit Black's Dewey Finn imparts on the youngsters falls away in an avalanche of tidy sentiment and warm fuzzies, and it becomes clearer than in the Farrelly Brothers' 'Shallow Hal' that he's at sea when he's forced to dial down his per
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Heartfelt, charming and devoid of anything to be misrepresented as manipulative piffle, School of Rock is solid in its celebration of rock and for those who recognize this pop culture movement as its orgasmic realm.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.76 <###> While Jack Black deservedly gets most of the credit, it's director Richard Linklater's work with a gaggle of youngsters that makes the difference between success and failure.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> He leaves NO CHILD BEHIND.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> The picture that gets the valentine to rock music precisely the way it deserves.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Director Richard Linklater has assembled a funny, sweet, and subversively anarchistic, blatantly antiauthoritarian little confection that never once loses its charm.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Hail! Hail! Jack Black: He's the clown king of rock & roll.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> 1. Jack Black must be funny. 2. The kids must not be precious. Done and donner.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Here's the perfect education for those about to rock.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> This film is an excellent example of how synergy can work in a movie's favor. There is a combination of the right script, the right star, and the right director.

10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> A shining example of how good Hollywood comedies can be when the right minds are behind them.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Black rocks as Dewey, simply because he refuses to treat the kids like children. Linklater eschews any sentimentality, holding what little there is in check.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Black works better as a team player than carrying a movie alone, and neither White nor Linklater have their hearts in this kind of parade-of -the- cute-kids flick.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The problem is that the film has about as much creativity as the episode of Brady Bunch where the kids decide to put together a band.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Linklater proves you can make a hit movie without being a sell-out.

10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Just like it's possible to have fun sober, it's possible to enjoy a Jack Black movie with kids.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The kids -- most of them first-timers cast for natural charisma and musical ability -- steal the show.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Not only a glove-fit of a movie for the volcanic Black, School Of Rock proves a surprisingly deft foray into pure, unadulterated fun for the gifted indie smart guy Linklater.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Obvious but sometimes funny.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> You'll think about it, weeks after seeing it, with a dopey grin on your face. (Yes, right now I have just such a grin on my face. Wanna make something of it?)
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Coherent, hilarious and surprisingly sweet.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Black's performance carries the movie.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> It's got a dynamo of a lead performance that will bust guts and melt faces! It's a JackBlacksterpiece.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> I like this film. But that doesn't deny it's naggingly familiar.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Soaring over the enterprise like a Robert Plant wail is the irrepressible Jack Black. A barrel-chested ball of manic energy, he's finally found a role worthy of his unique and slightly demented abilities.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> [Linklater is] so smart and has such a sure touch that he was able to take the otherwise formulaic School of Rock and make it into something worth seeing.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> It's the latest brilliant addition to the rock 'n' roll genre.

10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A family movie in the way The Osbournes is a family TV show. It puts the brimstone back into the treacle and, in the process, puts in the fun.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> An inspired, invigorating comedy that will have you laughing from its opening moments to its closing credits.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Black can go to the head of the class.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> One of those kid-movies that hits home with Boomer and Gen-X adults as well as their offspring.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> A picture with pop's delicious energy yet none of its attendant risk, a flick that no one will love but everyone will like.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> One of the sweetest, most appealing comedies to come along in quite some time, and much of that can be attributed to Black, who reveals a considerably more tender side here.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> School of Rock will play you like a Gibson Flying V. And you will like it.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> Credit for its hilarity goes largely to Black, who gives the performance of his career as a character who might have seemed merely coarse and crude in less gifted hands.

10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> School could best be described as The Bad News Bears with heavy-metal guitar moves instead of home runs, but that it touches all the predictable bases somehow becomes part of its charm.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> This raucous riff teaches that there's no substitute for a single, dynamic performer, one who can make us giggle just by walking into a shot.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> The themes of The School of Rock ... are as safely old-fashioned as Leave It to Beaver. But the way Black and the kids deliver that message, sharp and funny and never pandering, is itself delightfully subversive.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Black has found the signature role for his singular talent.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Don't skip school to see this movie, but maybe you can talk your principal into a field trip and go see it as a class project. Jack Black rocks and so does his mini-band.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It's a formula-driven movie, but it becomes irresistably fun
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> It's bust-a-gut funny without resorting to gross-out humor; it's sentimental without being syrupy; and it's charming without being manipulative. Most importantly, it actually rocks.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.6875 <###> This movie also has some of the biggest laughs of a comedy this year.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Unless Tenacious D - The Movie ever comes out, we may never get that ultimate flick for Jack Black, but this at least comes close.

10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A potentially A-B-C generi-comedy concept flick that's salvaged at every turn by the infectiously funny leading man and a collection of kid actors more sincerely personable than seriously precocious.

10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Achieves its ecstatic, giddy high because it is peopled by immensely likable, endearing characters, all led by the tireless Black, who could make even the staunchest country music fan believe that rock 'n' roll can, in fact, change the world.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The movie that gives born-to-boogie Black the role he was born to play.

10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Part of the blame should go to White's scattershot script, part to Linklater for not tightening things up, and the rest should be stuck on Black, who seems not to be ready for starring gigs.
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> School of Rock rocks!
10315 <###> School of Rock <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> An engagingly screwball comic vehicle in which the actor and Tenacious D frontman goes through an inventory of heavy-metal moves and makes a mockery of them at the same time.

16424 <###> Network <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> This tale of a failing network that feeds on the mental breakdown of one of its anchors, cannibalising itself for ratings, feels as savagely relevant now as it did when it was released nearly 40 years ago.
16424 <###> Network <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Criticised by some at the time for a certain naivety and lack of subtlety, this remains one of the most devastating condemnations of the media's urge to exploit.
16424 <###> Network <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Rousing, exciting satire, if not always the most perfectly focused and sophisticated.
16424 <###> Network <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> The mystic quality within "Network" is that it pitches curve balls at us that have meanings relative to our unique situations, and all of them encompass a value that is beyond simple comprehension.
16424 <###> Network <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 1.0 <###> A brilliantly played, stone-cold '70s classic, whose message -- the blur between entertainment and degradation -- has more than a tang of topicality in these days of reality TV-dominated scheduling.

16424 <###> Network <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> So truthful, so prescient, it's painful. Paddy Chayevsky delivers one of the best screenplays ever written.
16424 <###> Network <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Much of Chayefsky's script seems to have been written with megaphone in hand, which is close to how director Sidney Lumet airs it out. Yet in retrospect, maybe the ravings of Finch as a deranged anchorman aren't so far from surreal madness of Jerry Spring
16424 <###> Network <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> One would assume that a 1976 film about network television would feel dated today, but director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky had such a fine concept that Network seems downright contemporary.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> The Golden Compass isn't bad, it's cast is too good and it's too well made, but something fundamental to good storytelling - heart - has been lost, leaving a final product as icy and impossible to care for as Mrs. Coulter herself.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> I realize that when you make a book into a movie you cannot include every single detail, but it seems like Weitz purposely tried to take all of the magic out of the story.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> This plot may sound somewhat ludicrous on paper, but Pullman has created a logical, well-thought-out world that Weitz has brilliantly translated to the big screen.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The Golden Compass should be fun, but it rarely is. It should sweep you away, but it rarely does. For a film suffused with magic, it is, regrettably, far from magical.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> No, I didn't read the novel before seeing the film, and nothing in this shimmering disaster made me want to read it, either.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> In adapting Pullman's novel, Weitz jettisons its distinctive atmosphere and complex (and controversial) theological background and decides instead to whip through the plot.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> ...the cast is deadly serious, bringing each character to life and giving the audience a reason to cheer or boo them and their actions.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> For a film that supposedly promotes Atheism, at least it's more entertaining than last year's Christian allegory The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Unlike most fantasy aimed at younger audiences, there's a disturbing undercurrent at work here that imbues the film with a weightiness that's unusual in such works.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Those seeking a treatise on religion, or against religion, will have to look hard to find it in "The Golden Compass," a convoluted but eye-catching fantasy.

It's admirable. But soulful, philosophical 13-year-olds do exist. They do! And they can even handle a religious discussion with lots of words involved.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Despite all the controversy and hullabaloo, this is too incoherent and full of plot holes to lure impressionable children down some primrose path to atheism
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Although this might be a tad convoluted and distant for the younger set, The Golden Compass is still a truly fantastical journey filled with wondrous imagery.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Golden Compass lacks any real fantastic flair. It is a decent enough feature, but is short of that spell-binding quality that will allow audiences to embrace it.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> ... plays too innocent with its premise, seldom allows its characters to gain dimension, and all but ignores the looming instinct of the plot to abandon its innocence and begin discovering the dark little secrets of the writer's complex world.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The Golden Compass can answer any question with the truth. (It's too bad they didn't ask it if this story would make a compelling movie.)
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Catholic pundits are half-right in proclaiming that watching The Golden Compass could be hazardous to children. It shows that even the most lyrical and challenging literary story can become a stupid, sloppy film.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> We hope that youth will take to heart this movie which calls us to be wary of all authoritarian institutions that stifle the soul and the spiritual search for truth.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> This mediocre film that is heavy on computer-generated imagery adds up to little more than the Yawn-icles of Narnia.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> In the end The Golden Compass is another expensive mishmash of CGI 'magic' and widescreen spectacle: well-acted, as you would expect, but more or less empty of anything to provoke the curiosity and intelligence of a young audience.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Posh fantasy...the film's dazzling imagery and serviceable story hustle along agreeably, if a bit dourly.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> An enormous scrap at the end, involving witches and warlocks, does little to illuminate, or leaven, this pudding.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Thrilling, moving, visually spot-on and featuring a great cast, this is another impressive fantasy film, although one that rushes headlong through many of the important nuances of its source material.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Maybe we were all expecting too much.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Every character in The Golden Compass has a 'daemon', a talking animal sidekick who follows them everywhere.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Approach this not as a lesson in the facts of life, just a bit of childish escapism.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> With its rushed, jargon-pumped exposition, surplus of quarter-baked characters, stray narrative strands and generously dropped hints of things possibly to come, The Golden Compass is a movie that wears its franchise ambitions on its sleeve.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Compass isn't well-made. The heroine is a pill, the issues are jumbled (maybe because of the attempt not to offend potential moviegoers) and the storytelling is clunky.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Weitz's movie remains ultimately remote. It ends mid-adventure, so blatantly setting the stage for a sequel that the whole thing suddenly feels like a preamble.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> An aura of disappointment takes hold midway into Golden Compass and becomes undeniable by the finish.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The Golden Compass never seems to follow a single thread for very long. Instead, it introduces new characters for Lyra to meet on her journey. Few make an impact, and one who does makes the wrong kind.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Rather than saying, 'I wonder if the Magisterium is supposed to represent the modern Catholic church?,' say 'Wow! Two polar bears beating the shale out of each other. Cool!'
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> Represents the year's biggest gamble -- and it delivers the year's biggest and most ambitious fantasy.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> The action is crisply paced, the cast is committed to playing it straight, and if the script is pulling its punches, that doesn't weaken the story's headlong energy.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Beautiful to look at, but where's its heart?
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Bland treatment of round one of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The Golden Compass ultimately fails as a film in its broad strokes and inadequate scene development.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Weitz's film is short, punchy and efficient, and it's full of engaging spectacle.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> There'll be plenty of time for metaphysics and deep thoughts later. The good news for parents is that this haste makes a complicated story into short-attention-span theatre, perfect for children.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> This year's big holiday fantasy movie, The Golden Compass, is not as charming as the Harry Potter series or as spectacular as the Lord of the Rings movies, but it has something else to offer: ideas.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Why is it so joyless?
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> A darker, deeper fantasy epic than the Rings trilogy, The Chronicles of Narnia or the Potter films. It springs from the same world of quasi-philosophical magic, but creates more complex villains and poses more intriguing questions.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Weitz took a wonderful story about the danger of severing a soul from its otherwise empty body and did that very thing to his source.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Kidman's glittering villainess, gorgeous CG design and a bolshy, 11-year-old heroine can't entirely rescue this franchise gamble from a shuddering outcome. Not a failure by any stretch, but Compass leaves its future hanging in the balance.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> There's just too much information crammed into two hours, and Weitz directs it all as if he's waist-deep in quicksand and grandiose special effects.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> While The Golden Compass doesn't have time to clarify all the book's complexities it's as welcome a retreat from this old England as Hogwarts, Narnia or Middle Earth.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> A crushing disappointment for fans and a scuppered opportunity for a cinematic event. That the first book has been so mishandled doesn't bode well for the (already greenlit) more complicated ones to come.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.87 <###> ...the decision to tame the darker implications of the film feels driven by commercial concerns rather than demands of storytelling.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Like Lord Of The Rings and Chronicles Of Narnia it's a visual feast that transports you to an alternate world of jaw-dropping awe, unforgettable images and pure adventure.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> So much of the movie is just explanatory and expository dialogues and monologues. New characters, new concepts = more explanations. And lots of backstories.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.0 <###> The worst crime of a film like this is that not only is it retarded, it expects its audience to be retarded as well.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> As a stand alone effort, something styled to entertain us now, The Golden Compass is incomplete.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> A movie with characters constantly explaining arcane concepts and only rarely doing anything about them.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Certainly never boring, the film nevertheless feels too much like an introduction (and occasionally a discombobulated and less than emotionally engaging one at that) rather than a standalone piece of entertainment.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> An undemanding, blunt, simplified adaptation.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Ill Tempered Talking Polar Bears are the only elements of the film saving it from obscurity and failure
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> ... this is one of Kidman's best performances in years, and she is perfectly, deliciously evil.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> well paced, beautiful to watch
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> For all the complicated backstory, weighty themes, action set pieces and fanciful production design, the film is oddly unengaging.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Disappoints with its lack of character development and convoluted storytelling.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> For now, The Golden Compass can stand on its own, as a standard-issue but still glorious adventure.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> The best you can say about The Golden Compass is that it's merely the second-dullest Nicole Kidman/Daniel Craig film this year.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Hampered by its fealty to the book and its madly rushed pace.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Being afraid of the screen version of The Golden Compass is like being afraid of your shadow. The only ones with no faith are the filmmakers.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> There may be box-office gold from The Golden Compass, but panning for it while viewing is a real day at the mine.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Light on plot and philosophy, it's heavy on CGI animals, particularly a spectacular showdown between two armored polar bears.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> The actors can hardly move among all the computer graphics, much less express any emotion or spontaneity; there's no sense of wonder.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Visually, The Golden Compass is dazzling, hopscotching from hallowed halls of academe to the Nordic tundra, from luxe manors to creepy, sci-fi-like facilities.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> By the last reel The Golden Compass has created a magical environment we believe in completely.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> With all its hesitations and half-measures, The Golden Compass kindled something this critic hasn't felt in years: a burning thirst to see the sequel.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> The Golden Compass works up enough self-important gravitas to power the entire Lord of the Rings cycle. Weitz's deflatingly anticlimactic windup assures us there is more to come.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Writer-director Chris Weitz winnows down Philip Pullman's dense, unwieldy universe into a zippy, if not entirely thrilling, two hours.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Script feels rushed and is very short on character development ... most viewers will be baffled, feeling like they started at fourth or fifth episode in a ten-part production.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Chris Weitz dropped out of the film years ago because he thought he couldn't do this story justice.

494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> It certainly looks wonderful, with epic dash and a terrific central performance from Nicole Kidman, who may come to dominate our children's nightmares.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> This masterpiece of production design and world-building might take some time to get into, but once past the confusing premise, it's worthy of plunking down another $7 to 12 to find out what happens next.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Writer/director Chris Weitz brings a style that is more obligatory than deft. Constrained by a rushed feel and too little character development, this movie never seems to flow quite right.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Whether or not you've read the books you'll enjoy The Golden Compass on some level, but it feels rushed.
494046103 <###> The Golden Compass <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Chris Weitz crams his story full of magical terms and concepts with a rapidity that leaves things confusing and thus meaningless.
472405046 <###> Ransom (The Terrorists) <###> Mystery & Suspense;Action & Adventure <###> 1.0 <###> Tenso e inteligente, o filme cria um clima constante de suspense e nos envolve em uma trama repleta de reviravoltas que traz Connery como um sujeito perspicaz e absolutamente determinado a vencer o confronto com os terroristas.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Movies that start well and end badly occur often enough, and yet even knowing that is no preparation for what happens to Your Sister's Sister.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> I think I need a break from Mark Duplass for awhile. At least, from the Mark Duplass who isn't arguing about fantasy football with Ruxin and Taco.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> What could have been trite male wish-fulfillment is instead beholden to genuinely messy revelations: life as a tattered, living quilt we sew and wear as one.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> For a film that relies on conversation and connection, it's awfully plot-heavy, full of "Aha!" dramatic revelations that feel more suited to a soap opera than an indie dramedy.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This lo-fi comedy is big on charm but was a little too shaggy for my taste.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Although the action of Your Sister's Sister soars to an ultimately implausible conclusion, solid performances from Emily Blunt, Mark Duplass and Rosemarie DeWitt keep the overall piece afloat.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Your Sister's Sister is a fine piece of character observation. It's low-key, casual, and tremendously insightful. It won't be for everybody, but that's a good thing. It's a strong, focused piece of work.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> One of the most purely pleasurable 'grown-up' films I've seen this year.

771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Right from the get-go, this indie American talkfest exudes a confidence, a composure and, dare I say it, a cool that extinguishes any cynicism in the room.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Everything that takes place on screen feels convincing as Shelton is more concerned with representing her characters truthfully rather than pushing an agenda.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The rom-com twists don't always work, but it's easy to fall for stars who clearly love acting together - particularly Blunt, who could make a paper bag dazzle.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Enjoyable but surprisingly conventional contemporary (i.e., sexually frank) romantic comedy...

771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> Your Sister's Sister is a very sweet, very human feature that is also very, very funny. Much hay is made out of Mark Duplass' reaction shots, and that's just fine by me.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Behavior -- a mixture of scripted action and improvisation -- springs from a natural place, and while that can be uncomfortable as well as funny, it never rings false.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Such are the pleasures of improv when the players are as sharp and canny as they are here.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Lynn Shelton's fourth feature after her well-received "Humpday" demands more patience than understanding.

771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> There's a special satisfaction in hearing characters speak as if they just had arrived on the screen from the coffee shop adjacent to the movie theater.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> This twisted tale has hidden agendas, pillow talk, latent romantic feelings, verbal fireworks and an ambiguous ending. As an avid bicyclist, the movie earns points from me in having Jack always wearing a helmet while riding. It loses its goodwill when...
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Duplass is wonderful but even he can't shine as brightly as Emily Blunt.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The film's conceits may be a bit too contrived and conventional, but nothing about these characters' interactions are forced. Your Sister's Sister is a welcome guest.

771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> There's a nice, loose-limbed improvisatory feeling to "Your Sister's Sister," a quality that identifies it as the work of artisans, not assembly-line professionals.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Much makes the viewer feel they're a fly on the wall, albeit a fly who has difficulty holding the camera steady or staying in focus.

771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The film's strength is in its realistic improvisation, like a window on three, average lives in a cocoon for a brief moment that will be easily forgotten tomorrow.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Lynn Shelton's follow-up to Humpday is an engagingly spiky, pleasingly unconventional comedy-drama with a strong script and a trio of terrific performances from its three leads.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> This film should come with a warning: don't watch with a sibling. Unless you're up for some knowing elbow-digs.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> It's small, but not simple. There are three shocking dramatic twists that feel completely earned.

771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Shelton and her cast are so skillful that before long it seems we are not moviegoers watching a screen but flies on a wall witnessing real encounters and the beauty of the Pacific Northwest.

771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.71 <###> The cast certainly seems to have fun with the material but while their improvisation gives the dialogue life, it also lacks a certain refinement that could've come from more time or a single hand.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Shelton's very gifted at avoiding the cliches of a story that could have easily weighed it down and made it just another generic Mumblecore drama.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.84 <###> Effective evidence that the emotional immediacy in the halting rhythms of extemporaneous speech can often trump the art of the well-chosen word. A film that is both warmly and naturally funny as well as uncomfortable and awkward.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> ...about our desire for family, however unconventional.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Shelton is too much in thrall to improvisation, and letting the actors "find" their characters.

771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It's a tribute to Shelton and her cast that they've made a film about the difficulties of love, friends and family look so easy.

771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> The setup is intriguing, but just as Shelton gets her hands dirty with the mess her characters have made, it's winding down to a seemingly improbable conclusion.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Director Lynn Shelton garners three terrific performances from her leads, but she does so while losing sight of her most promising narrative thread.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It's pleasant as far as it goes. For all the blithe interaction among the central three performers, however, the material's conventional and predictable.

771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The jabber is maddening, but with all due respect, the actors are wonderful, the performances as natural as inhaling. Still, in Emily Blunt's case, there is such a thing as too natural.

771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A trio of superb performances guide a plot that pivots on secrets and lies before they fester. Your Sister's Sister works its way into your head until you can't stop thinking about it.

771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Shelton is a wonder with actors and she mines some gold from this sitcom setup - DeWitt, in particular, showcases a spiky comic deftness.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.85 <###> Director Shelton just keeps getting better. An interpersonal drama, the story's offset with elements of a modern sex farce, blending and sculpting the whole into a fraught, funny weekend.
771251352 <###> Your Sister's Sister <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> It's a hopeful, upbeat film about people finding comfort and strength in their loved ones, a rare feel-good movie that truly earns that designation.

771323823 <###> Death Race 3: Inferno (Unrated) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Inferno absolutely pulls ahead of Death Race 2 as far as the Death Race franchise is concerned, but that's not hard when your competition comes in at an uncontested dead last.
771323823 <###> Death Race 3: Inferno (Unrated) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> there's plenty of action - and plenty of boobs
771323823 <###> Death Race 3: Inferno (Unrated) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> Ask it no questions and it will tell you no lies: a fair bargain that too many other films on this level resolutely refuse to grant.
771323823 <###> Death Race 3: Inferno (Unrated) <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.6 <###> Feels like the unkempt offspring of Lock Up, Mad Max, and The Cannonball Run. Only not as good as those movies.
14168 <###> The Candy Snatchers <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.875 <###> Not a classic, but an unjustly forgotten oldie from the golden age of violent exploitation ...
14168 <###> The Candy Snatchers <###> Drama;Horror;Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.7 <###> Off-beat '70s drive-in fare about a kidnapping gone awry. Exhibits a twisted sense of humor that put it years ahead of its time. Tarantino obviously got a few ideas from this one.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Spy Kids 3 is much sharper and funnier than the second outing, but the missing pieces, namely the parents and sister, are sorely needed.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Where Rodriguez falls short... is in relying on the computer generated special effects to make up for problems in the script.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> If the old red and blue 3-D glasses make your eyes hurt, you may have to skip this one, but that's the only bad thing you can say about it.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The 3-D is crap. And Rodriguez should have had more sense than to make Juni the star of the show.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Even without the 3-D, set pieces such as a high-octane race and a faceoff between two giant robots would be surefire adrenaline rushes.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Rodriguez's movie still has enough shiny objects popping off the screen to make it a satisfactory summer distraction.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> certainly the least of the series because it continues the slide in character development that began in the second movie
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.19 <###> Though Rodriguez's seeming one-man operation is somewhat impressive in concept, the results are decidedly inferior to most action/adventure fare.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It's the charisma of the child stars which carries the picture. And the infectious energy of the creator, whose frothy franchise has now run its course.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> I can only hope this episode turns out to be what it feels like: a very unfortunate, very rough bump in the road.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> What's disappointing is that, unlike before, filmmaker Robert Rodriguez is more passionate about the film's machinery and less so about its motifs.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Robert Rodriguez's 3-D computer-aided kid flick bytes off more than it can chew.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A painless diversion, but also an undeniable rush job that makes enough misguided storytelling decisions to place it as the worst of the three Spy Kids flicks.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is about as vibrant as a penny arcade hit by a sudden power outage...is indeed one grand video excursion that needs to be unplugged.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It's depressing to see that one of the few franchises built on teaching lessons is now just a summer popcorn movie.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is the clumsiest of the trilogy, but Robert Rodriguez still manages to insert just enough thrills and surprises to make the effort worthwhile.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A harmless disappointment, hampered by the thin story and a surprisingly dreary looking video-game setting, heavy on the floating platforms, cartoony future-cityscapes and goofy gadgetry.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Rodriguez may have overreached his abilities with this film.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The main problem, apart from being trapped in a bad video game, is that the movie, cheeky but mindless, and so expensively pointless, isn't about anything.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Though not nearly as good or as clever a film as its predecessors, kids will most likely find Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over a fitting conclusion to the trilogy.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> While there's a certain rough charm to the handmade virtual reality world [Rodriguez] creates, the movie still has the undeniable drawback that it causes a headache.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The clever action and throwaway flights of fancy come close to making it worth the 3-D headache.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The story is flimsy, simple-minded and often nonsensical, compounded by some obtrusively abysmal supporting cast choices.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The film itself is practically a Saturday-matinee tribute to the Atari Hall of Fame -- from Tron to Q*bert -- and almost reproduces the druggy, hyperactive 2-D world of Nintendo.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The game may be over, but I'm sure the sequels will live on - as long as they stay fresh and fun, that's not such a bad thing.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> ...something between `Tron' and `The Matrix,' though with a cheery warmth in place of the chilly dysphoria.
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> While it is easily the least of the three films and not quite as focused or ingenious as the previous installments, it still has an endless amount of creativity behind it and while kids will eat it up without question, there is enough ingenuity to provide
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> While inferior to its predecessors, the third Spy Kids is the first 3-D movie able to hold its own as a 2-D film.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The all-CGI, cartoon-inspired game F/X are undeniably cool in three dimensions...but Rodriguez aims lamentably low in almost every other aspect of the movie
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Without 3-D, Spy Kids 3-D has almost nothing to hook an audience.

10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> [The best part of the movie is] Sylvester Stallone, enjoyably ridiculous as not only the Toymaker but three other goofy-looking dudes!
10461 <###> Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over <###> Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> The 3-D finale of Robert Rodriguez's cutesy children's franchise now stands as frontrunner for 2003's most mindless and physically offensive moviegoing experience.

329320883 <###> Butch and Sundance: The Early Days <###> Western;Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> ...there's just no storyline holding the whole thing together.
14166 <###> Bird <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> Eastwood shows a Parker that is haunted by his boyhood addiction, and shows off the innumerable people who loved his talent who were let down by him time and again.
14166 <###> Bird <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> Overlong, and reeking of prestige.
14166 <###> Bird <###> Drama <###> 0.71 <###> Eastwood clearly is committed to presenting Bird to his audience with all of his complexities and contradictions intact.
14166 <###> Bird <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Whitaker gives a towering performance as the tortured musical genius, and Venora is equally impressive as the independent, compassionate Chan.
14166 <###> Bird <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Bird is less moving as a character study than it is as a tribute and as a labor of love. The portrait it offers, though hazy at times, is one Charlie Parker's admirers will recognize.
14166 <###> Bird <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> "a well-produced downer that moves like a funeral procession"
14166 <###> Bird <###> Drama <###> 0.65 <###> Reduced to the bare bones of people and plot, the film winds up dancing around the edges of questions it doesn't answer -- straight-ahead rhythm coupled with straight-ahead melody, and not quite enough depth to either one.
14166 <###> Bird <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> Whitaker occupies this world as a large, friendly, sometimes taciturn man who tries to harm nobody and who cannot understand why the world would not let him play his music. Neither can we.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Trouble is a sampler of the kind of roles Roberts and Nolte should play more often.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Generic as its title, I Love Trouble is like a Xerox of a copy of a facsimile.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Again and again, the I Love Trouble script takes us deeper and deeper into the machinations of a high-tech company when what we want to see is Nolte and Roberts outfox each other.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Is there chemistry between Roberts and Nolte? Not really. This by-the-numbers production is more like math than chemistry.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> You can tell that they like each other by the way they hate each other. Shakespeare may have invented the recipe, Tracy and Hepburn may have refined it, but Nolte and Roberts certainly hold their own.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The lack of chemistry onscreen allows the paper-thin premise to collapse in on itself, and there's very little else left to salvage.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The running badinage of Roberts and Nolte lacks the tartness and bite that made those classic couplings and the old screwballs crackle with contentious wit.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> If you can get your head round the idea of Julia Roberts as a ruthlessly ambitious newspaper reporter, then there's plenty to enjoy in this frivolous comedy thriller.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The picture works, thanks in part to actual chemistry between Nolte and Roberts.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Fluffy murder mystery-comedy with Roberts and Nolte in fun form.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Neither terribly funny nor convincingly romantic
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Just no chemistry between the leads.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A disjointed and tedious action-packed romancer featuring the miscast leads of Nolte and Roberts who toil along in this dull and draining ditty
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The movie tries to play like a '40s romance-thriller, but this is the '90s, folks.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Fails to meet even meager expectations. Nolte and Roberts show little spark.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> I Love Trouble is a perfect example of a truly lightweight motion picture.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Maybe it would have been funnier if the evil cow conglomerate had been replaced by something sillier and more lightweight; it's hard to sustain a romantic comedy in the face of death threats.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> The end result is rather forgettable.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> As much as I found myself wanting to enjoy I Love Trouble, it barely managed to divert me.
11996 <###> I Love Trouble <###> Action & Adventure;Romance;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> As cliched as I Love Trouble is, it still manages to please.
771379015 <###> Panic 5 Bravo <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.625 <###> The stuff that goes down in this dark, dismal little thriller takes grim reality to nasty new extremes.
771379015 <###> Panic 5 Bravo <###> Mystery & Suspense <###> 0.5 <###> This is a pressure-cooker scenario, and the film is not badly made. It is, however, weirdly flat, given the stakes and the wild screaming matches.
326299634 <###> I Clowns (The Clowns) <###> Television;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Italy's great ringmaster of the cinema returns to the source of his inspiration -- the circus -- and skilfully absorbs it into his own personal vision.
326299634 <###> I Clowns (The Clowns) <###> Television;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Not Fellini's best, but Fellini nevertheless.
326299634 <###> I Clowns (The Clowns) <###> Television;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This is the film's ultimate message: don't think so much and just try to have some fun.
326299634 <###> I Clowns (The Clowns) <###> Television;Art House & International;Science Fiction & Fantasy;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> This is artful and sometimes very amusing, but it doesn't work as fiction because Fellini is tied to facts, and it doesn't work as documentary because Fellini will not (cannot?) abandon his gift of giving the raw material an artistic shape.
13177 <###> Papillon <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics <###> 0.7 <###> The narrative unfolds slowly, but the two stars are compelling and cinematographer Fred Koenekamp's photography is striking.
13177 <###> Papillon <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> Steve McQueen's career high performance upstages Dustin Hoffman.
13177 <###> Papillon <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> Awesome jailbreak film with gritty performances.
13177 <###> Papillon <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics <###> 1.0 <###> Classic grungy prison drama with great performances throughout.

11190 <###> Vincent & Theo <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> An absorbing, disturbing study.
11190 <###> Vincent & Theo <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> [A] film that generates the feeling that we are in the presence of a man in the act of creation.
11190 <###> Vincent & Theo <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> a humanistic exposition akin to Surviving Picasso and Pollock
11190 <###> Vincent & Theo <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> The enjoyment in Vincent and Theo comes more from the director's attention to art history than from his ability to interpret it anew.
11190 <###> Vincent & Theo <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Contains just the right mix of drama, visual richness and psychological nuance.
11190 <###> Vincent & Theo <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Altman tackles the monumental story of Vincent van Gogh and his brother Theo and, for the most part, comes up a winner.
11190 <###> Vincent & Theo <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> Brilliant performances, great use of color.
11190 <###> Vincent & Theo <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> There is something about the life of van Gogh that has inspired Altman to do his best work in some years.

11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Basically, any movie that suffers from a lack of Charlie Sheen has got problems.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> As with Scary Movie parts one and two, you pays your money, you gets your laughs, and you won't remember a thing in a few months.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Fun, stupid stuff with no sense of a narrative arc or plot structure ... but hey, it made me laugh anyway.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> If you're looking for anything other than a parody clipshow, you won't find it.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Scary Movie 3 turns out to be an odd combination of the old-fashioned and the hip. I found it too awkward a combination to be entirely successful.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The film's comic philosophy might best be summed up this way: If you think it's funny seeing Sheen bang his head against a lamp once, then it's twice as funny to see him do it twice.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The only thing more worn than the humour is a tired-looking Nielsen.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Leave your brain in the foyer, and your taste in the toilets.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Algumas gags funcionam, mas numa razao de cerca de 30%, eu diria. Portanto, talvez esta producao valha o preco do ingresso - isto e, caso voce consiga 70% de desconto.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Often in spectacular bad taste, but like its predecessors it made me laugh hard and often.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Delivers plenty of decent laughs in its short running time.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's time to stop, I'm afraid.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> ... the only people who'll remember it will be the ones cashing their checks afterward (or who'll campaign a studio later to do another one of these turkeys).
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The vibe of Zucker's great films is there, but because the subject matter is so scattershot, it's not handled as richly, and the payoffs are shallower.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> the film skewers a group very worthy of cinematic abuse and misuse, being what we playfully refer to as the stupid.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Zucker amps up the slapstick a little too much, resulting in headaches where belly laughs could've easily been harvested.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> This PG-13 rated film -- give me a break! -- illustrates everything wrong with the MPAA's rating system. Sleaze oozes from every celluloid frame.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> There are a few disappointing deviations that hinder the comic thrust of the movie, but still, I'm not ashamed to admit that, yes, I did have a few good belly laughs...
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Pamela Anderson, Simon Cowell and a Michael Jackson clone - certainly some folks' idea of a good time but little more than an act of sheer desperation as far as I'm concerned.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The scariest thing about Scary Movie 3 is that it's actually pretty funny.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Yes, it's very, very stupid. But it's also full of hilariously inspired comedy.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Saying that Scary Movie 3 is better than its predecessors isn't exactly high praise...
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> I don't expect Zucker to exhibit good taste, but he could have relied less on the predictably crude and crudely predictable.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> I never thought I'd find myself waxing nostalgic for the charms of 'Scary Movie 2.'
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.1 <###> There's stupid, and then there's nonsensically stupid. Scary Movie 3 is absolutely nonsensical.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Best way to ensure a film isn't taken too seriously? Cast Leslie Nielsen of Naked Gun fame as president of the United States. That'll do the trick.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> ..."Scary Movie 3" is not without its problems...
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> When Scary Movie 3 hits, its belly laughs are loud and long, and it actually picks up steam in its second half.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Ultimately a disposable movie that feeds off the pop culture of the moment, but for now -- for some generally funny comedy -- it's not a bad time at the movies.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> ...that's three times the regurgitated chuckles since the original made the scene and ushered in this so-called unavoidable phenomenon that keep popping up like an annoying pimple on an adolescent girl's face.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> No one goes to Scary Movie 3 expecting a work of genius. We go to be distracted for a while. It works on that level. Sometimes that is enough.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Leslie Neilsen reteams with Zucker as President Harris, and it's refreshing to see him in a wacky comedy spoof that is actually funny.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Enough laughs for me to recommend (on video).
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> If you aren't going to make the movie funny, you could at least make the title appropriate.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> This third outing is 90% chaff, 10% wit, and pure Children of the Corny.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> See it if you must.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The flood of silly jokes will either make you laugh or they won't, but at least Zucker enlists the services of several veterans of this kind of nonsense.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> While the spoof may not be dead, Scary Movie 3 may mark the death of the genius of David Zucker.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> At barely 80 minutes, it's just as long as it needs to be, and almost as funny.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Despite the sluggish third act, Scary Movie 3, for what it is - and that would be big, dumb fun - is worth shelling out the duckets for.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> If a film can't make you laugh when American Idol host Simon Cowell gets shot at a freestyle rap competition, something is seriously wrong.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Scary Movie 3 starts out so funny you'll be wishing you'd brought a respitory assistance apparatus... but then it continues.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> If your idea of a good time is trying not to roll in the aisles with laughter and risk making a fool of yourself, then Scary Movie 3 surprisingly fits the bills.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A sequel funnier than its predecessors.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> If the casting, synopsis and very concept don't deter you, you'll probably find it very funny.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It's all been there, razzed that, with long flat valleys stretching beneath the comic peaks.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> It's last year's satire, wearing this year's clothes.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> There are a few laughs in Scary Movie 3, but most of the content is hopelessly dated.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The scattergun humor occasionally hits the broad targets -- and sometimes misses by a mile.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> The Naked Gun 33 1/3 wasn't the final insult from a founding ZAZ (Zucker/Abrams/Zucker) member; this is.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Scary Movie 3 is a veritable time capsule of of-this-moment kitsch, schlock and bad taste. And it's funny, too.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Plays like 80 minutes of Naked Gun rejects.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Mediocre spoof.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Though it has moments of unbridled hilarity, Zucker can't sustain the laughs even for 76 minutes.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Scary Movie 3 might just be the best third movie in a series ever, even funnier than Escape From The Planet Of The Apes.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> For each silly gag or joke that works in Scary Movie 3, there are at least 10 more that don't.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> If you don't think Mother Teresa commemorative bobbleheads are funny, this movie is definitely not for you.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The movie is filled with famous and semi-famous faces, although only two of them work for their laughs and get them.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The last 15 minutes of this movie feel as sleepy and uninspired as the last 30 of any recent episode of Saturday Night Live. But the movie has given up long before that.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.45 <###> Whereas monkeys and farts will always be funny, Scary Movie sequels shall no longer be so.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> This sequel limps, and hopefully this whole franchise is headed where it belongs; a shallow grave.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> You're not going to die after you see this movie, but for the next 7 days you'll be haunted by the images and cursed with questions about why they keep making these sequels...
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There are worse comedies, but few more pointless.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> There are a few genius gags in Scary Movie 3, but the laugh-to-joke ratio is disappointingly low.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The funniest and possibly sickest entry yet.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> A tedious run-through of all-too- familiar plot points, spiced up with lots of banged heads and people getting thrown out of windows.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Current horror movies are so ironic, they parody themselves, which means they have beaten (and stabbed and eviscerated) Scary Movie 3 to the punch.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> I like my physical comedy as much as anyone, but, wow, did this ever feel like a creative dead-end.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> [David Zucker] still has the eye, ear and metabolism of a hyperactive child weaned entirely on candy bars and educated by Mad Magazine.

11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Consistently entertaining and frequently hilarious.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.71 <###> Less crude than its predecessors, this is a modestly successful spoof with just enough laughs to have you walking out with a smile on your face.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Does the idea of a watered-down, Wayans-free version of Scary Movie 2 sound like your cup of tea? If so, your knuckles must be raw from scraping the ground.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> incredibly thin
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Although it's a definite improvement over the last movie, Scary Movie 3 feels like 20 minutes of material spread over an hour and a half.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> David Zucker hasn't exactly breathed new life into the series, but he knows what old jokes still work.
11195 <###> Scary Movie 3 <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> This is by far the best installment yet.

770672401 <###> Kung Fu Panda <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> While its storyline might seem familiar (in fact, very familiar if you've seen the recent live-action Jackie Chan/Jet Li hit, The Forbidden Kingdom), there's enough invention and irreverence to make the film feel fresh.
770672401 <###> Kung Fu Panda <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> While the movie might not be as artistic as, say, one from Disney-Pixar, it features better combat scenes than much of its live-action brethren -- including the recent Forbidden Kingdom.
770672401 <###> Kung Fu Panda <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> This is well-worn territory, from the cuddly slapstick to the Chinese wisdom, but the movie redeems itself with some surprisingly smart and tender moments.

770672401 <###> Kung Fu Panda <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> Sticking to a tried-and-true formula (hapless underdog discovers he's the Chosen One) still proves effective when it's done with a snappy pace, eye-popping animation and a cast of game comedic vocal talents headed by Jack Black.
770672401 <###> Kung Fu Panda <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> Outside of Japanese anime - and maybe Pixar's The Incredibles - I can't think of another animated feature packed with this much exhilarating, ingenious action.

770672401 <###> Kung Fu Panda <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> A nice little adventure that will keep the kiddies entertained for an hour and a half. Mom and dad will find some nice moments as well.

770672401 <###> Kung Fu Panda <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> I'm no fan of casting big movie stars as voices in animated films, but Black and Hoffman have great fun taking their characters from exasperated adversaries to bedgrudging comrades.
770672401 <###> Kung Fu Panda <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> This is a solid family film material, although one suspects the children will get a little more out of it than their parents.
770672401 <###> Kung Fu Panda <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 1.0 <###> Oh heck, this is my favorite film of the year so far -- A ! Action, depth, fun, comedy, profound messages and it's visually gorgeous.
770672401 <###> Kung Fu Panda <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> The movie's crackpot message--'To make something special, you just have to believe it's special'--may best be proven by the existence of this funny, unpretentious, more than bear-able crowd-pleaser.
770672401 <###> Kung Fu Panda <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> Even though Panda is one of the last animated flicks that Dreamworks won't be making in 3D it's still very easy on the eyes and it should help to keep the studio in competition this summer with the juggernaut that is Pixar.

771351665 <###> The English Teacher <###> Drama;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The script eases into a toothless comedy about an alum's unproduced play, an awful-sounding suicide drama championed by Moore's character like the second coming of Odets.

770676275 <###> Battle in Seattle <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.375 <###> Battle in Seattle is a childish, ineffectively manipulative piece of self-serious agitprop about the four-day World Trade Organization meetings in 1999.
770676275 <###> Battle in Seattle <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> Actor-turned-filmmaker Stuart Townsend would have been better off keeping things on a more modest scale. There are just too many characters here.
770676275 <###> Battle in Seattle <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> This is a powerful, wrenching and impressive writing and directing debut for the talented actor, definitely now a triple showbiz threat.

770676275 <###> Battle in Seattle <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.75 <###> Very ambitious, the story constantly jumps back and forth, trying to give both sides of the story. I'll say it's mostly successful.
770676275 <###> Battle in Seattle <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.6 <###> Braiding brief snippets of these automatically suspenseful storylines with archival video footage of the actual event, Townsend makes a good point that the thing just got away from all involved.
770676275 <###> Battle in Seattle <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> It's easy to see why Townsend was attracted to this inherently dramatic situation, but the characters he's put on screen feel less like real people than like entities created to either make plot points or stand in for specific positions.
770676275 <###> Battle in Seattle <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.625 <###> The film's default position is to always fall back on anti-capitalist rhetoric whenever dialogue and drama grow too banal.
770676275 <###> Battle in Seattle <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.5 <###> The chief culprits are Townsend's TV-movie characterizations and a very muddled message.

770676275 <###> Battle in Seattle <###> Drama;Action & Adventure <###> 0.4 <###> But a drama is only as convincing as its characters. The people awkwardly forced together in Battle in Seattle are rhetorical mouthpieces tied to the sketchy plotlines of a so-so Hollywood ensemble movie.

771353749 <###> The Hot Flashes <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> unlikely to put Susan Seidelman back in the front ranks of Hollywood, even though it is an enjoyable, albeit highly derivative, comedy that dares to put "women of a certain age" front and center.
771353749 <###> The Hot Flashes <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> It's heart is in the right place, but -- with poor writing, lame humor and dreadful on-court sequences -- that's one of the only things right about it.
771353749 <###> The Hot Flashes <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> By and large this is a film meant to do exactly what the film's charity event does: to provide light entertainment while raising money for a good cause.

771353749 <###> The Hot Flashes <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> In critical ways, the movie is a mess. The basketball scenes are so sloppy and haphazard that the would-be slapstick registers as confusion. But away from the court, the actors bring their caricatures to folksy comic life.

771353749 <###> The Hot Flashes <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Even though it earns an R rating for profanity and some risque material, it's too meek and mild-mannered to qualify as brave, or even slyly subversive.
771353749 <###> The Hot Flashes <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> This comedy deserves credit for taking a decided viewpoint - and delivering a heartfelt if occasionally misguided message.
771353749 <###> The Hot Flashes <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Better for what it is than for how it's done...provides a welcome opportunity for five actresses of a certain age to share the screen together and yet it's pretty much a bland outing because virtually every scene plays out in a programmatic way.
771353749 <###> The Hot Flashes <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> The leads in The Hot Flashes come across as one-dimensional, pseudo-feminist cliches whose conversations seem contrived and whose jokes land with the thud of airballs clunking on hardwood.
771353749 <###> The Hot Flashes <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Susan Seidelman has been making these blandly safe movies for years now; what happened to the edgy exuberance of her early films, like "Smithereens" or "Desperately Seeking Susan"?

771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Less ethereal and flirty than Julie Christie's Bathsheba, Mulligan anchors the film and stirs the viewer with her contradiction-filled, flesh-and-blood, dynamic portrait of a norm-busting Hardy heroine.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.25 <###> What viewers are left with is a flop of a film that weakly gestures at ideas that deserve a lot better.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> In the end, this Far From the Madding Crowd is a handsome but bloodless version of the Hardy classic.

771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Vinterberg is clearly more interested in the characters' emotional, romantic entanglements than in being stuffy or classy.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Vinterberg may rush the final act, but he brings out the wild side in Mulligan, who can hold a close-up like nobody's business. She's a live wire in a movie that knows how to stir up a classic for the here and now.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The fact that this film prompts not a sob but a shrug is a tragedy all of its own.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Lovers of period drama should not feel disappointed but it does lack some of the wild passion and intensity required truly to capture your heart.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Mulligan is spot-on, the rest hovers between solid and forgettable.

771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> A thoroughly modern film anyone can relate to - it's like a "what a woman wants" discussion set in Victorian times. It's also an instant classic.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The film is at its strongest in the scenes between Bathsheba and Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts).
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> I was captivated. Carey Mulligan gives an Oscar (R)-quality performance; it never occurred to me that she was acting...ably supported by a fine cast and beautiful cinematography.

771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> A woman fights to keep her freedom in Thomas Hardy's love quadrangle, rendered visually by director Thomas Vinterberg in a poised, crisp, and actor-centric film.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> pleasant if predictable
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Far from the Madding Crowd is pretty to look at, even if it is a sort of SparkNotes version of Thomas Hardy's novel.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> An amazing meditation on yearning and the brimming hearts of three men and the woman they all want to marry.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> For a story that's all about choice and consequence, the way it rips through plot points in the latter half makes the ending feel more like an inevitable contrivance than a maturation. Although, in fairness, the scenery always stays just as beautiful.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> An enthralling, complex, nimbly acted drama with a sweeping romance that doesn't shy away from sexual politics.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Bathsheba should be more than a dress-up doll, and the rest more than a potboiler. Lost in the gloss is Hardy's weirdness, and with it half his greatness.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> It's a wholly respectable adaptation, though perhaps a flash or two more of wildness wouldn't have gone amiss.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> This filmed version of Hardy's fourth novel is well worth seeing. It rises head and shoulders above most of what we've been seeing lately.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> If there's one complaint about "Far From the Madding Crowd," it's that the chemistry between Mulligan and Schoenaerts doesn't totally spark. But then, how much pizzazz does one really expect from Victorian England?
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.7 <###> As a cinematic condensation, it mostly works, even if the pace sometimes feels a bit frantic.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> A "Far From the Madding Crowd" in which romance is a matter of audience indifference or benign mystification is an adaptation not firing on all cylinders.

771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> It's easy to read this 19th century tale as modern and feminist, but it's even more exciting is how right it gets sloppy, not always sensible emotions.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> Ultimately, this is a romance, so our heroine never strays too far from the appointed path - and its swoony end - but the director also gives her space to explore what it might be like to, well, just have your own piano.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.875 <###> A well-cast period romance aching with longing
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Sprawling romantic novels such as Hardy's are often best suited to serial television, because bringing heart and mind into sync takes time, so it's just as well that - apart from the brutal tailoring - Mulligan is seamless.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.9 <###> I was never a fan of the 1967 version with Julie Christie, but director Thomas Vinterberg gets it all right this time with this hugely romantic adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel that features a never-better Carey Mulligan in the lead role.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Carey Mulligan's commanding performance is an easy beacon to follow: her Bathsheba is caught between the vulnerability of youth and the strength of knowing her own value.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> For all the bucolic beauty and ravishing romance, we're reminded that violence is never far from the surface - and Vinterberg captures the brewing tragedy magnificently.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> Extremely well done and well acted, it's an attractive, appealing, involving adaptation, just not as iconic as the '60s film.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.625 <###> The lack of real analysis or consideration leaves this perilously close to a Goldilocks-style depiction of privileged female indecision.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.8 <###> David Nicholls deserves huge credit for condensing Hardy's sprawling melodrama into a rollicking screenplay that comes in at under two hours and still hits all the major plot points.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> [It] has one great strength: an outstanding performance in this difficult, perhaps fundamentally incoherent, role from Carey Mulligan, far more intense, compelling and modern than Christie, much more intimately filmed.
771368269 <###> Far From the Madding Crowd <###> Drama <###> 1.0 <###> With dashing redcoats, picturesque bucolic vistas and heaving bosoms aplenty, there is more than enough in Danish director Thomas Vinterberg's gorgeous adaptation of Thomas Hardy's classic novel to treat any lingering Poldark withdrawal symptoms.

770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> The film almost overwhelms the audience with information, throwing out so many facts and figures, and so much footage, that it's all hard to process.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> The movie needed to reflect its own lesson: Less would have been more.

770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> The movie is presenting its case in such a uniformly insistent tone, as the directors pile on one voice of doom after another.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> As depressing as the first two-thirds of the film is, the last third is surprisingly empowering and hopeful.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.375 <###> As a call to action, it's sincere but flawed, and as an inquiry into humankind's bafflingly self-destructive tendencies, it scarcely scratches the surface.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> The shadowy photography of the interviewees lends an ominous tone to nearly every scene, but what they're saying is often pragmatic and helpful.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> An Inconvenient Truth was short on how to make life better. It rushed through a list of 'what to do next' offerings in the film's last few minutes. Here is where The 11th Hour shines.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.6 <###> An earnest, thoughtful documentary.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> Consistent with the film's occasionally hippy-dippy tone, DiCaprio speaks about human beings engaging in a willed 'evolution in consciousness,' which sounds a little too desperate to be comforting.

770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> This movie, for all its noble intentions, is a bore. Rent An Inconvenient Truth instead. Even if you've already seen it.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.875 <###> The movie says we have to get back to the garden before complacency and ignorance hasten our demise. This is a hard argument to make without sounding kooky, but the documentary is too dire to turn dippy, cheesy, or sentimental.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> The 11th Hour is a very good movie, and its message absolutely deserves to be heard; let's just hope that in his efforts to escape the media's attention, DiCaprio hasn't situated himself in a place that will not only overshadow his celebrity, but the far
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> The film's eagerness to embrace alarmist speculation undermines the basic truths it tells.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> Manages to be serious without being extreme in its message that global warming is no longer something to be debated but addressed and fought NOW.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> If it gets people thinking about which light bulbs they buy and their current gas mileage and such, then it's good to have it in the world. It is, however, a panicky blur as documentaries go.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> More concerned with emotionally manipulating the audience than breaking any new ground on the subject matter.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> nothing less than a complete rethinking of the relationship between humankind and the planet on which it lives. Complex, challenging, mind-expanding, and sometimes mind-blowing
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> a film that wraps its message around a hurled brick.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.75 <###> Persuasively damning... some might say these ideas are still being exhaustively (though inexplicably) debated as a political issue, but perhaps the film's greatest strength is in making its hysterical, activism-now urgencies an emotional issue.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.875 <###> Hugely effective documentary is a terrifying vision of exactly what's in store if we don't pay greater attention to what we're doing to the planet in our blind rush toward 'progress.'
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> Challenges us to change our consciousness and transform our lives by living lightly on the Earth in harmony with nature; offering a road map to a sustainable future, this is one of the most important documentaries of the year.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 1.0 <###> An unnerving, surprisingly affecting documentary about our environmental calamity [that] is such essential viewing.

770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> If you get through the first hour without slitting your throat, the cautiously optimistic last third offers some intriguing options.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.5 <###> DiCaprio's star power probably propelled this film into release, even though Gore has stolen much of his thunder.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> Its foretelling of gloom and doom almost make the entire idea of worrying about the global climate change crisis seem unnecessary, seeing as we're all apparently going to die by our own industrialized hands.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> It is unabashedly a documentary of talking heads, but it works.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> The 11th Hour is good-for-you cinema in content, shape and form. There are far badder things.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Takes a doom and gloom approach to the earth's current plight, but also offers a ray of hope and intelligent solutions for making a change.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> If you still need an argument about global warming, the documentary -- makes a good one.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.25 <###> Unusually undisguised leftism. The scare montages are--I'm not making this up--very similar to one shown in last year's remake of The Omen.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.625 <###> May be a kindred spirit to An Inconvenient Truth, but in terms of style, tone, and scope, this Leonardo DiCaprio-produced and narrated documentary on climate change is a wholly different beast.
770670485 <###> The 11th Hour <###> Documentary;Special Interest <###> 0.8 <###> Among recent documentaries questioning the status quo, The 11th Hour takes the most far-reaching point of view and connects issues into larger patterns, culminating in a truly global call for change.

771254851 <###> Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> The Taiwanese epic doesn't shy away from anything even though the message is pretty hopeless. But all of the film's depth seems to have been stripped away.
771254851 <###> Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale <###> Drama <###> 0.6 <###> Given China's ongoing interest in the island and its unknowable future, this historical backstory behind current events is welcome indeed.
771254851 <###> Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> At times, Warriors sacrifices dramatic nuance for scale, but even its most rousing passages are tempered by a sense of loss.
771254851 <###> Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> You can see why Woo, the noted Hong Kong action director, would want to produce it: It fits right in with his "heroic bloodshed" cinematic legacy.
771254851 <###> Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> As the war drags on, "Warriors of the Rainbow" outstays its welcome. I've never seen more severed heads in a film and cared less.

771254851 <###> Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> At 2 1/2 hours, "Warriors" is a bruising, relentless experience, one more tiring than inspiring.
771254851 <###> Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale <###> Drama <###> 0.75 <###> There's something to be said about a two-and-a-half-hour war epic that manages to make each of its countless decapitation scenes feel earned, even called for, in the moment.

155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Think of this benign, not-so-kosher cultural comedy as "My Big Fat Jewish Bar Mitzvah."

155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Exactly like "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," only without the Greeks or the sense of humor.
155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A winningly sincere and warmly humorous film about an ancient Jewish milestone in the time of Martha Stewart.
155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> There are no laughs in Keeping Up with The Steins, which is problematic, since it appears to think it's a comedy.
155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It's not the kind of comedy that makes you laugh till your face hurts, but it'll give your smile muscles a good workout.
155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Occasionally cute, the film is far better when satirizing competitive parents than it is during the dysfunctional family moments.
155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Had Scott Marshall and screenwriter Mark Zakarin honed their knives sharper, they could have made genuine mirth out of this.
155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The tribute to an aging parent is moving and gives this routine comedy an extra something.

155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Not a total loss, but it's disappointing, given what the movie might have been. It might have been more than a lengthy sitcom.
155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Shooting a comedy, like telling a joke, demands a sense of rhythm, and Scott is no dancer -- he keeps tripping against the grain of the humour.
155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> We get the distinct feeling this film has been made by people who don't really want to offend their friends, who would rather spend a million dollars impressing others as opposed to throwing it away on hunger relief or American education.
155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Director Scott Marshall, Garry's son, and screenwriter Mark Zakarin have their hearts in the right place -- steering clear of Jewish stereotypes and showing the uneasy father-son bonds -- but put their minds on auto-pilot.
155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Warm, witty, and sitcom-obvious -- a genuine audience pleaser that's built to wring laughs of pained recognition from anyone who has survived a bar mitzvah as either a participant or an observer.

155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Fatally short on laughs. The jokes are mostly bad vaudeville, as when Piven asks, "How much for 50 Cent? Okay, how about 17 Cent?"

155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Keeping Up With the Steins begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers.
155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Well intentioned but sloppily rendered, and unlikely to satisfy anyone but a very narrow section of the marketplace.

155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> A tweener in every respect: It hasn't the nerve to offend anyone, yet it hasn't the flavor of warm-hearted comfort food.
155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> A pleasant coming-of-age story is too often brushed aside for goofy shtick involving grandpa and his younger, hippie girlfriend.
155654965 <###> Keeping Up With The Steins <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Scene-stealing by Gary Marshall and Jeremy Piven does little to salvage a weak, corny satire of the bar-mitzvah ritual.
349677664 <###> The Naked Prey <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Classics <###> 0.7 <###> Taken as a lively adventure yarn, it's enjoyable, but the claims that there's more to it than that ring a little hollow.

770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> The greatest pleasures offered by Steve Kloves' screenplay involve these familiar characters enduring the unexceptional pangs of adolescence.

770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> The Potter pictures have become the modern exemplars of establishment moviemaking.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is spellbinding, even though it is more grounded in reality and less fanciful than previous installments.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> Readers may decry the way the script deletes some scenes and adds others.

770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> An impressive and troubling work, boasting a dark and nightmarish undertow that many more "adult" or "legitimate" films attempt but fail to achieve.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> A remarkable achievement in imagination, storytelling, and underlying thematic relevance, a motion picture that visually dazzles as any respectably made blockbuster should, but also knows not to misplace the human element at the forefront.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Already past the point when most film franchises would be wheezing their way toward irrelevancy, Potter keeps going strong with a sense of purpose and ambition that puts most of Hollywood to shame.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Visually, yes, this is another solid Harry Potter entry, with the same impressive sets and effects.

770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> The Harry Potter films will be regarded as one of the most remarkable series in film history, and Half-Blood Prince is the franchise's Empire Strikes Back.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> Half-Blood Prince is a bubbling cauldron of hormonal angst, rife with romance and heartbreak, jealousy and longing.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> As the concerns of novelist Rowling's characters gravitate increasingly toward matters of the heart and the hormones, the Potter films are leaving childhood behind.

770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.875 <###> So many actors shine in so many ways: Carter hisses deliciously, Broadbent sucks up beautifully. Watson shudders with frustration and heartbreak, Felton shudders with anger and fear.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> I admired this Harry Potter. It opens and closes well, and has wondrous art design and cinematography as always, only more so.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> It all starts with the books of course, but perhaps it is time to recognize the Potter films for the impressive franchise that it, too, has become.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> A film that stands on its own, The Half-Blood Prince is the purest example of virtuoso storytelling we have seen all summer and maybe all year joining a short list that includes Up, Away We Go and The Hurt Locker.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> We're still wild about Harry and this - basically - sets the stage for the seventh - and final - book which will be divided into two movies.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> We're marking time before the final battle between Good and Evil, with the promised darkness sitting somewhat clumsily with teen romance and humour.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> For fans both of the films and the books, this is an elegant addition to the canon.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> It doesn't reach the magical heights of Alfonso Cuaron's truly spellbinding Prisoner of Azkaban, but Yates is fast approaching that territory, which bodes well for his helming of the final instalments.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> This will certainly be a strong contender for movie of the summer and few will fail to be impressed by the breathtaking finale.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> One of the Potter franchise's breeziest entries yet offers flashes of darkness but lashings of teen tension. Less a movie than a set-up for next year's epic conclusion. Bring on V-day.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 1.0 <###> An impressive film that stands out as the jewel in the Potter crown.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> For all the raging teenage hormones stirred into the usual potion of magic and adventure, the sixth instalment of the Harry Potter saga is a slickly unemotional affair.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> The sixth installment of the Harry Potter series is neither the best nor the worst so far. The acting has improved considerably and the effects are better than ever but nothing really happens and there are some unforgivably slow stretches.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Longer than the last, the sixth episode of the adventures of the increasingly burdened magic warrior of Privet Drive is a more human affair than its predecessors.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> The latest instalment is more of the same tried and tested formula to be sure, but it's a formula that produces pure gold as far as the fans are concerned.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> By far one of the best of the series, and absolutely the funniest and most human.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Why David Yates decided to move the series so far away from its fantasy adventure heartland is puzzling.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> It's hard not to feel like this is little more than an interim piece in the overall story, presumably leading to something much bigger next time around.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> I have to say, this was the most satisfying book-to-film transfer of them all. It never felt rushed. They took time to tell the story. The effects were wonderful, but not overdone. With a few exceptions, they included the major plot points from the book.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.95 <###> A remarkable achievement... moving, funny, honest and true and sad and sweet. A movie about characters who we have come to know and love, and a movie that understands that it's these characters, and not the magic they perform, that is the real hook.
770672988 <###> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Kids & Family;Mystery & Suspense;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.9 <###> For pure fun, adventure, romance and thrills this is clearly going to be the movie to raise the bar for this summer's blockbusters.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It even has something like a brain with awareness of the world outside the film, and that is too rare of a commodity in American film comedy in the 2010s.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> The problem with situation comedy movies in general - and Will Ferrell vehicles such as The Campaign in particular - is that they usually fizzle out after the first 30 minutes.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Poking fun at the nastiness of elections, The Campaign finally brings together two of Hollywood's funniest comedians.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Jay Roach's The Campaign can be funny at times, but it's mostly an exercise of patience as two usually funny men scrape the bottom of the barrel for some truly unfunny jokes. Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis have both been in much better films.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> A hopelessly broad and undisciplined comedy that features a small handful of amusing ideas but otherwise represents a major missed opportunity for rich Stateside election year satire.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Funny and entertaining, it's not a heavyweight contender, but who wants a heavyweight contender every time?
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> If it's sophistication you're looking for, forget it. This one's strictly for low laughs, at which it succeeds nicely.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The Campaign is an equal split of smart and stupid. Some people may be off-put by the wild detours into vulgarity, but I relished it.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The Campaign does manage to strike a funny chord but don't be ashamed to find out these election results on home video.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Will Ferrell's funniest movie in years, this is a silly comedy with a terrible sentimental streak, but the political satire running through it is dead on
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Using tired, lazy stereotypes that swerve any relevance to the times, it ironically treats both Americans and its audience with the same contempt as the politicians it lampoons.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> With subtlety hardly its strong point (the humour is broad-beamed, brash and at times bordering on farce) it's raucous entertainment.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Perhaps one in ten of the jokes hits the mark; the rest are damp, childish squibs
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> There are some laughs, it doesn't overstay its welcome and neither side in the present fight for the presidency is likely to be offended.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Don't look for wry satire - the gags are big and brash - but with the duelling stars on top form, The Campaign scores high in the approval ratings.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The increasingly absurd squabbling between Ferrell and Galifianakis provides more than enough hearty laughs to be getting on with.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Wisecrack after wisecrack is delivered with that skilled quick fire timing of his much loved character Ron Burgundy. This may be no surprise as he is currently re-heating the hot seat of San Diego's favourite newscaster.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> If you're solemnly looking for contemporary political observation, this isn't the film for you. But laughs come rolling off the production line a-plenty.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Who says political satire is dead? Most of the audience for The Campaign will say it.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> All sounds a bit deja vu. Didn't they make this in the late-'90s with Chris Farley and David Spade?
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> More of the non sequitur jokes and shouting on which [Ferrell] has built a lucrative and long-lasting career.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Hits an occasional vein of funny, but for the most part it's inescapably half-assed, largely relying for laughs on Ferrell's familiar schtick of delivering filth in deadpan tones.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> With a cast and crew well-versed in cinematic humour, the film struggles to translate to comedy gold, mainly down to an indecisive approach to the material and two performers reluctant to stray outside of their comfort zone.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Entertaining comedy with a handful of big laughs and great performances from a strong comic cast, but the tone is a little uneven and the film is slightly hamstrung by the desire to keep its characters likeable.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> While much of the humour feels eerily dead-on, the over-the-top antics rely on shock value for laughs. Which is kind of a con when the movie turns out to have such a gooey centre
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This film is about silly voices and crude sex gags and jokes about children touching an old alcoholic's man boobs. Thank god.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The Campaign gets by on its stars' comic compatibility and a relentless stream of jokes, many of which are laugh-out-loud funny.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The Campaign is worth a watch. It's funny, well-acted, and entertaining
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> For a timely comment on today's political world - where everything is seemingly caught on camera - it's entertaining, light-hearted and nicely played by a great comedic cast.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> "The Campaign" is yet another one of those films where I walked in expecting one thing and ended up getting something else entirely.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> It was only a matter of time before Ferrell and Galifianakis crossed swords on screen, and the combination of their distinctive styles of humor are as natural as a politician kissing a baby.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Although only slightly more outrageous than reality, The Campaign is a funny, pacy peek behind the political curtain.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> For all the talk-radio blather about "liberal Hollywood," "The Campaign" shows Hollywood as an institution is strictly bipartisan - eager to sell tickets to people of all political stripes, and averse to offending any of them.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Although the over-the-top antics are outrageous and outlandish, they're grounded in the bloody mash-up realities of modern-day politics.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Has some funny moments, but the humor pales when it becomes too realistic.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> After a wonderful start, the filmmakers decide they need a 'likable' hero, so they embrace the pandering appeals to home and family they had spoofed in the campaign scenes, and, in the phony finale, reassure audiences that the corrupt will be punished...
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> You may think things go over the top, but keep in mind The Campaign is competing with a real world in which a married politician tweets a picture of his crotch.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It's a satire of the election process and it also lampoons we the people ... you know, us voters.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.52 <###> As uplifting as the slight story line aims to be, it unfortunately still leaves a sour aftertaste.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Getting a few chuckles and one or two laugh out loud moments is not enough, especially when Ferrell and Galifianakis could make fun of our actual political system, instead of this truly fictitious one.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Having helmed the Austin Powers trilogy, both Meet the Parents films and Dinner for Schmucks, director Jay Roach deploys his knack for broad comedy with often uproarious abandon. Make no mistake, the film cannot be faulted for having taste.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> So like most times I enter a voting booth, I'm going to half-heartedly pull the lever and vote for The Campaign.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> ...it is McDermott who nearly steals the entire movie. He is nasty, manipulative, and brutally honest. You can't take your eyes off him.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Combines breezy political jabs with mainstream comic sensibilities successfully. The duo makes a great comedic pairing and the Ferrell/Galifinakis era of films may have just begun.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> There is much about which to make sport in the American democratic process, and much of it is covered here, but not consistently well, and with little originality.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Ferrell and Galifianakis can be insufferable on their own, but placing them in the same movie? It sounds as potentially disastrous as that McCain-Palin ticket, but against the odds, The Campaign meets with success by playing beyond its established base.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Doesn't get my vote. I recommend a veto.
771258806 <###> The Campaign <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Stupidly vulgar, mildly amusing, yet uneven "Saturday Night Live" skit that goes on too long.

770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> We left the theatre feeling that we had spent a satisfying evening at the movies, but in retrospect I wish the screenwriters had tweaked the story's sophistication as much as they did the technical effects.

770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> As a passable time-waster for hardcore sci-fi fans, the remake is certainly watchable enough. But then again ... most hardcore sci-fi fans will probably have the same problems I had with the movie.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Despite a great build-up and a solid performance from Connelly, this is another tired attempt to update a classic. Do yourself a favor and rent the original instead.

770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.0 <###> This answers the age-old question, how bad can a movie be?
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The movie's emphasis on brawn over brain might not be so off-putting if the action sequences provided Iron Man-level whiz bang wow, but all of the big set-pieces are marred by confusing choreography and low-grade digital effects.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> It doesn't seem right that a film with a story line about ecological disaster would be a piece of cinematic garbage.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> There was nothing wrong with the original that warranted a re-do--other than pursuit of legal tender.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.125 <###> If you want to see all the cool special effects in this remake, watch the trailer. If you want the extreme environmentalist agenda that goes with them, buy a ticket.

770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> I'll give it credit for being at least moderately entertaining, with a handful of effective moments of adventure and suspense. At the same time, it's really quite a shame that the film wimped out on driving the message home.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Keanu Reeves plays an alien who doesn't talk much and shows no emotion. I really think he has found his perfect role.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.75 <###> [It] is passable, [but] it is not great science fiction. It will feed your sense of wonder but it has so many plot holes it leaves you wishing it were better.

770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Scott Derrickson's remake ...provides the best evidence I've seen lately that money can't buy class. It also can't guarantee an effective movie, let alone a meaningful one.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> A good portion of this sci-fi disaster movie is unintentionally comical. And the parts that aren't funny are just plain dull.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> The only awe this movie inspires is realizing how well the original stands up, and how little we puny Earthlings have learned in the past 57 years.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Admittedly, the imminent destruction of Earth is not a barrel of laughs, but where Independence Day had a sense of humor, The Day the Earth Stood Still seems to have taken a vow not to crack a smile until species stop vanishing and lakes stop drying up.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> This was supposed to be the winter season's big special effects picture. So why does it make Al Gore's PowerPoint presentation look like Spider-Man 2 by comparison?
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Who goes to a sci-fi film to be reminded about conservation? I get enough of that from my recycling bin, which, by the way, is far more visually exciting than The Day the Earth Stood Still, as well as more pleasing to the ear.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Remaking a movie is easy. Engineering a good remake is difficult. One key quality that separates the two is inspiration, and that's a characteristic not to be found in 2008's The Day the Earth Stood Still.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still may bill itself as science fiction. But it understands neither.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Unless you've seen Robert Wise's original semi-documentary The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), you'd never suspect the utterly generic remake was based on a seminal sci-fi classic.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The stone-faced silliness in this new TDTESS at first seems like an homage to old-fashioned '50s watch-the-skies movies, until it becomes clear it's just newfangled bad filmmaking.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Unfortunately, it's the demise of even passable screen storytelling, rather than the earth itself, to which audiences will be treated in this dreadful remake.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Keanu Reeves was clearly born to play Klaatu, the alien from another planet who visits Earth with a dire warning.

770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> Neither offensively bad nor particularly good, The Day the Earth Stood Still may be best remembered for the clumsiness of its intrusive product placement.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> Even if you know the original by heart, the new Earth has a couple of surprises in store, although the message remains the same: Watch it, Man.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> This Day has a big special effects budget but has little sense and even less soul.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Is it supposed to be an intense, character-driven tale set against an alien invasion, a la Signs? Or an effects-blowout such as Independence Day? The filmmakers never reconcile between the two.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> Arguably the worst reconstitution of a '50s sci-fi classic since the ghastly Godzilla remake, The Day the Earth Stood Still is a stunningly misconceived folly that is bearable only for as long as it remains a fair-to-middling chase movie.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> "The Day the Earth Stood Still" doesn't lack heart. It's surprisingly sincere. No, the human quality it could use a bit more of is humor.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> There was no way to re-make The Day The Earth Stood Still properly today.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The new Day the Earth Stood Still lacks the courage of its own eco-pessimism, and the final scenes play like a rushed, embarrassed concession to our need for happy endings, no matter how far-fetched.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> What shatters your hope for a new classic is the movie's descent into semicoherent spectacle.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> After Wall-E and I Am Legend and the dozens of apocalypse flicks since the last Day the Earth Stood Still we can surely do better. Even Klaatu looks bored and distracted, much as he did back when we knew him as Neo.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> It's a flat, lifeless story with a flat, lifeless lead. Humans are flawed, humans are beautiful, the Earth is dying ... it really feels like we've been here before.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> This loud, hammy, and, above all, pointless do-over only serves to point out the genius of the original.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> If you're looking for chuckles this holiday season, bypass the miserably unfunny Four Christmases and go where the real comedy is -- The Day the Earth Stood Still, a clumsy, moronic remake of Robert Wise's brilliant 1951 classic.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The Day The Earth Stood Still's original version aspired to blow our collective minds and inspire our hearts; this new remake settles for making our eyes pop out, with a slight hope our jaws will go slack from the spectacle.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Add to that some unimpressive CGI and a bizarrely abrupt ending and you have the day your buttocks went to sleep, your brain melted and your will to live evaporated.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> How smart can it be to broadcast this into space? The real Klaatu could be out there monitoring us. A movie this bad could tip our fate scale in the negative direction.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> A remake that does not disgrace the original, this is sufficiently different to stand alone and just as relevant in its concerns - as well as succeeding (arguably better) as a thriller.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.333333333333 <###> Sending a flying v-sign right at the splendid Robert Wise original from 1951, this daft and pointless sci-fi remake has very little to recommend it.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> It's not good enough, at this point in the game, to serve up this collection of cliches and expect anyone to be fooled or entertained by it for a minute.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> The flick is a very plain Jane version of a disaster film with mediocre special effects, no character depth whatsoever and is just a complete waste of money.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> It's divine tongue-in-cheek tosh.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Keanu Reeves stars, giving the kind of torpid performance that lesser beings can only approximate by necking a hundredweight of Temazepam. The lights are on at the top of the spaceship, but there's no one at the controls.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> Impossible, we can handle, but the eschewal of all internal logic starts to feel like an insult, the cinematography is dismal, and the cocktail of lazy CGI and po-faced, sub-Al-Gore environment lecture leaves you light-headed with tedium.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Needing only to span the emotional range from blank to sincere, Reeves is pretty well cast. Sadly, there's not enough Gort and too much of Smith's squirt.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Cranking the action dial up to 11, Derrickson retools an iconic piece of sci-fi with lots of big guns but extra smarts would have been welcome. It's bang up to date but a tad underwhelming. Not the disaster some fanboys predicted.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> It almost feels like even the cast are wondering why they bothered making a movie that didn't really need making. Flat, but not terrible.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.0 <###> The Christmas turkey has landed, in the form of 20th Century Fox's worst blockbuster ever.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> This remake of the 1951 favourite is oddly botched, trying to combine some timely themes with the structure of a more conventional action thriller.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.1 <###> I hate myself for sitting through the entire film.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.2 <###> The whole thing finally crashes and burns in an orgy of noisy and uninspired special effects that stands as a lunkheaded rebuke to the restraint displayed by the original film
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> When faced with a boring movie during the holiday season, you can only use one quip, so I am going for it. BLAH humbug!
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> An overall lame piece of science-fiction and an even lamer parable that fails to distinguish its own ironies of what's worth saving when filmmakers like Derrickson pee all over something so many of us cherish.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> It's an impressively big film, and even when it's bad, it's bad in a big way.

770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still won't make you forget the original, but it doesn't stain that classic's legacy.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> If all you ask from a movie is cool CGI effects, The Day the Earth Stood Still is for you. Look for any more than that and you'll be sorely disappointed.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> This is one production that could have used a few more rewrites, if not a total reworking of a plot handled with more gusto over five decades ago.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> Dunno about the Earth, but time certainly stands still for a goodly portion of Scott Derrickson's expensively produced but utterly boneheaded remake.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> A lively reinvention of the 1951 science fiction classic with a fitting ecological message about saving the planet.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> The general feel of the movie is so chilly that it's unappealing. In fact, the whole thing resembles a bad episode of TV's The X-Files.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> if you're willing to go in with an open mind and some filmmaking forgiveness, you'll find this a Day well spent
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> The new Earth is both too dumb and not quite dumb enough to be any fun at all.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> As a message movie, it's preachy without being serious; for an action movie, there's a lot of racket but not much fun.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> Klaatu's temperament is not the only thing that has been changed in this enjoyable updating.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> In one eye and out the other, the sullen remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still airlifts certain story details straight from its source material.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> An entertaining rethink of the 1951 classic.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> The film fizzles in the second half, when flashy effects replace coherent storytelling, and everyone goes all weepy over the innate decency of humanity.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> The movie stumbles to an ending that's more whimper than bang.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> All this is presented in an expensive, good-looking film that is well-made by Scott Derrickson, but to no avail.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> Since Keanu Reeves has all the expressiveness of a toaster, why is he starring in the new The Day the Earth Stood Still as human-looking alien Klaatu rather than giant robot Gort?
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> a pale shadow of the classic, piling on special effects and grafting original elements onto a dopey and sub-par thriller that bogs down in its own self-righteousness
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> Many fans of the original will hate it. A pity. Because it redocorates the tale while remaining true to its theme. Keanu Reeves plays Klaatu with all the expressiveness of a wok. I have never seen a wok better portrayed.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.625 <###> As it becomes clear, too early in the game, that Klaatu's executioner's song is really a didactic bluff, 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' loses its urgency and much of its raison d'etre.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> Like a skydiver whose parachute never opens, plummeting towards an ending that basically says, 'Humans: Awful at Environmentalism, Great at Hugging.'
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.375 <###> ...a big, dopey, old-fashioned, science-fiction disaster movie - which is odd, because its 1951 predecessor was anything but.

770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> It really is the perfect "family" holiday thriller (the edgy side of Christmas) and carries a message that is so perfectly fine-tuned to our problems of today it might actually make you feel a little guilty. If a movie can entertain you and make y
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.6 <###> This Earth could have moved if they had embraced the heart of Starman. Too bad they settled for a half-hearted Independence Day.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Better to just sit back and enjoy The Day the Earth Stood Still for what it is: a fair amount of fun.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.7 <###> Despite the generally weak acting, this modern remake is as effective and thoughtful at capturing the global zeitgeist and how the world today might react to an alien invasion as the original.
770675291 <###> The Day the Earth Stood Still <###> Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.3 <###> The original 1951 film carried a timely anti-nuclear message, but this film wouldn't dare offend anyone by even mentioning the phrase "global warming."

14355 <###> Cyborg <###> Action & Adventure;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.25 <###> Few genres amuse me more than post-apocalyptic fantasies about supermen fighting for survival. Cyborg is one of the funniest examples of this category, which crosses Escape from New York with The Road Warrior but cheats on the budget.

771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.55 <###> [Lack of] clarity is this slick adaptation's biggest fault.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.88 <###> Maybe Wright and Stoppard have not given us a great Anna Karenina. .. this movie is too derivative and flashy for that, but they have connected the romantic and philosophical poles...The heart wants what it wants, and will destroy itself to have it.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.54 <###> The film does not do even minimal justice to the themes informing the tragedy.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> A whirlwind affair composed of dazzling set pieces and a driving narrative.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> While there are suitably glorious elements, there's also a frankly bizarre and much-debated aspect added by playwright Tom Stoppard, so that the whole thing is full of 'Brechtian Alienation Devices' and narrative-splintering tricks.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> It's easy to conclude that this Anna Karenina is a superficial portrait of a superficial society, but that would be to dismiss how emotionally powerful it is in key moments.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> There have been countless film and tv versions of Russian author Leo Tolstoy's classic high society love story. But none have been captured so beautifully and boldly as this Anna Karenina.

771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Leo Tolstoy's classic tale of doomed romance and the emotionally stifling lives of Russian aristocrats gets an ornate, inert reworking...the congested setting makes much of the film look like a blur of costumes and set dressing.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.7 <###> Between the screenplay by playwright Tom Stoppard and the direction of Joe Wright, Anna Karenina is a stylistically fascinating film.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.3 <###> Trying to one-up Tolstoy was always going to be a bad idea, though I wouldn't object to seeing a Bond movie, or Les Miserables, staged in the same way.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> Joe Wright uses the theatre and has the actors taking part in a stage production which then moves out into the real world. I think that's done beautifully.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.9 <###> Well, Joe Wright has done it. His ANNA KARENINA is a triumph.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> Wright's staged version tries desperately to gain one's attention (which it does) and engage one's affection (which it doesn't).

771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> It would be unfair to, ahem, throw the whole movie under the train because of one casting error and a few ill-advised directorial choices.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> Like a modern music video, it's more about the look and image than it is about the substance behind all of that. Wright gets swept up in his own visual romance.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> The actors' passion overrules the filmmakers' artifice.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> It's hard to argue that tackling this story again was necessary, and this version can't be called definitive or revelatory. However, Wright has done an admirable job of investing this tale that's more than a century old with a modern sensibility.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.375 <###> (Director Joe) Wright's cinematic choices, unfortunately, keep viewers at arm's length instead of drawing them into the story.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> It's a half-success -- a baldly conceptual response to the Leo Tolstoy novel, with a heavy theatrical framework placed around the narrative of girl meets boy, followed by girl meets train.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Where we ought to see a soul-freezing sense of paralysis, followed by a torrent of passion for an inappropriate man, we get a generalized kind of melancholy and neediness suited to Real Housewives of St. Petersburg.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Parse too closely the space between "neat" and "conceptual" and "trick," and there's little emotional truck to all the elaborate conceit.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> Director Joe Wright's Anna Karenina is a work of art -- technically brilliant, lavishly filmed and visually stunning.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> In this adaptation, director Joe Wright, plus screenwriter Tom Stoppard, are determined to tame the untameable. And they do.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.55 <###> ...dazzling early on, but as the film reaches the mid-point, the highly stylized staging gimmick begins to wan. Still, like "Cloud Atlas" early this year, the attempts to craft a unique and interesting visual are to be lauded and encouraged.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Director Joe Wright's undeniably fresh approach helps smooth the wrinkles in a film that suffers from uneven storytelling.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.82 <###> Joe Wright, reuniting with his Pride & Prejudice and Atonement leading lady Keira Knightley, has found a fresh take, shooting Tom Stoppard's script with a metaphoric and highly stylized theatricality.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> What Tolstoy continues to teach us, and what Wright captures so beautifully in his movie, is how love and desire force one to act in ways others cannot understand.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> If it's only a play, why should we care?
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.7 <###> Presents Tolstoy's creation as a passionate love story with great costumes.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Stoppard's touches serve only to pull the viewer away from the story and act as a distraction.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> The very picture of noble failure, it's a bright red heart without a beat.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> A glorious feast of a movie that is unlike anything else you will see this year.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> Suffers from that most appealing and rarest of flaws: too much ambition.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> Sports some good performances and is nice to look at at times, but it's ultimately both spectacularly ill-conceived and deathly boring.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> There's no getting around the fact that Johnson is disastrous.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.7 <###> A dazzling looking, amazingly adaptable theater transforms into. . . a busy eyeful of sturm und drang, where the gentler love story of Kitty and Levin outshines the tragedy.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.1 <###> The theatrical artificiality constantly upstages the Tolstoy tragedy, which turns this production into an endlessly annoying experimental film.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> I found it extremely difficult to become emotionally invested because the style kept intruding, pulling me out of Anna's journey and making me concentrate on the filmmaking choices.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> There is a freshness and daring to Anna Karenina, which is something that probably hasn't been said in a good 100 years.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> The movie's still gorgeous, but Anna's great tragedy, condensed and accelerated and enacted underneath the visible ropes and pullies of the stage, never attains its power.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> Even more than most versions of "Anna Karenina," this chamber piece is heated by two combustible characters, not by the winds of war and peace.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.7 <###> A beautiful production and strong performances by Law and Knightley
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> Who's for 130 minutes of alienation?...We're able to intellectualize why we should care (those social strictures are crushing hearts!), but we're too distracted to be moved.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> Thank goodness for Domhnall Gleeson's gentle turn as Oblonsky's friend Levin. The ginger-haired landowner is the movie's warmest figure.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> The clever camera moves and inventive uses of stagecraft feel like sound and fury, signifying nothing.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> It's hard not to admire Wright's bold approach to Anna Karenina's story of longing and jealousy and societal condemnation.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> I admire the film's ambition, but I can't fully recommend it. Sorry. I need some characters that I can care about. But it's almost worth seeing for the film's unique style.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.7 <###> Knightley and Law are what salvage Wright's interesting stab at something different, taking an interesting, if flawed, experiment and turning it into something better than it probably ought to be.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> You don't merely watch Joe Wright's sumptuous "Anna Karenina," but you waltz with it, run with it, whirl with it.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> This multilayered movie is not your average Tolstoy adaptation.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> This story has been filmed many times, but never with this kind of erotic charge. Knightley is glorious. My advice is to let Wright's Anna Karenina work its strange and marvelous spell.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.65 <###> It's an incredible thing to behold, at least at the start.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.7 <###> The silly setting substantially diminished the enjoyability of an entertaining film with a fine script and terrific acting. Too bad that Wright didn't have enough confidence in the story and his talent to tell it straight up.

771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.7 <###> Wright's rendition of Anna Karenina is indeed flawed but the rich performances, succinct screenwriting, and strong direction make it a re-interpretation worth seeing.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> What Wright has made here is a musical without songs.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> A perfect, and dare one say it, playful vehicle for Keira Knightley, who always brings a chest-heaving sexuality to such period pieces...
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> For "Anna Karenina" to truly work, you have to look at this two and think, what a tragedy. Instead you look at Anna and think, what a fool.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> A handsome, grandly theatrical reimagining of the Tolstoy novel starring his muse, Keira Knightley.

771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> The overpowering momentum perpetuated by this virtuoso camerawork makes it difficult to focus on anything else.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> The novel features one of the most famous endings in history, and Anna Karenina has a sense of propulsion that matches the instrument of that tragedy.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.25 <###> Wright made the movie he wanted to make, and he made it well. It just wasn't worth making.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> An intoxicating spectacle that breathes new life into the classic Tolstoy novel, incorporating the notion that all life's a stage -- at least for imperial Russian society.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.875 <###> Director Joe Wright pulls off an impressive feat, taking the iconic, timeless work and making it his own.

771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.75 <###> As a one-time devotee of Russian literature, I was suitably diverted and occasionally impressed. Your mileage may vary.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> There's a coldness to the new "Anna Karenina" that has nothing to do with the white stuff piled up along the streets of 19th-century St. Petersburg. It's the chill that comes from a director entranced with his own talent.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 1.0 <###> It is risky and ambitious enough to count as an act of artistic hubris, and confident enough to triumph on its own slightly - wonderfully - crazy terms.

771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Though it distracts from the realism that makes the novel so immersive, the artificiality does highlight the most genuine aspect of the movie - the performances.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> The conceptual gimmickry eclipses everything else, including a typically sharp script from Tom Stoppard and the earnest efforts of well-dressed Brits playing well-dressed Russians.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Maybe it's time to focus on coming up with new classics instead of constantly returning to the old ones?
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> This is a sumptuous film - extravagantly staged and photographed, perhaps too much so for its own good.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.5 <###> James Joyce once wrote that [Tolstoy] was "never dull, never stupid, never tired, pedantic or theatrical." He might change his mind if he saw Anna Karenina.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.2 <###> ... the signal achievement of this version of 'Anna Karenina' is that it manages to use a world literary classic as the platform for nothing less than the longest Chanel ad ever.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> Wondrous as all this artifice is, it's also a huge distraction. The self-consciousness of the structure keeps us at arm's length emotionally.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> It never feels like we're watching people pressed on by the burdens of society and history, just extravagantly costumed puppets navigating Wright's colorfully shallow bag of tricks.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> We have expectations of what to expect from period romances. Anna Karenina defies them. Masterpiece Theater it is not.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.9 <###> Some may have an allergy to Wright's interior aesthetic that can't be explained away. That's valid, I suppose, but one must ask just how many times we need to see the classics done up in Merchant-Ivory clothes?
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.9 <###> A bold and borderline insane adaptation that anoints Joe Wright as a modern filmmaker who reveres the old guard
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.625 <###> The film contains far more passion and a tad more complexity than the dominant and typically more staid model of middlebrow costume drama.
771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.8 <###> A fresh version of the classic romantic drama, set on a theater stage, that explores the choices people make for passion.

771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.6 <###> It's hard to watch Wright's version without wondering what might have been, if only Knightley had a worthier scene partner than Aaron Taylor-Johnson.

771250010 <###> Anna Karenina <###> Drama;Romance <###> 0.4 <###> Rather than involve us in the story Wright's grandiose concept keeps it at arm's length, forever highlighting the smoke, mirrors and meticulous stage management that have been pressed into service to make his big idea a reality.

771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The film never gives any sense of clarity regarding how its pieces fit together, leaving us to wonder who the true idiots are.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> While the movie coulda/shoulda been longer than its scant 90 minutes, it's actually surprising just how much memorable material is packed into the piece.

771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The title sibling almost makes up for the shortcomings of the story, but Our Idiot Brother falls short of brilliant.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Somehow the script manages to eke out enough new jokes and sweet moments to help me hang in there with Ned, and Elizabeth Banks makes a deliciously despicable Miranda.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> His actions and everyone else's reactions create a path of insufferably trite destruction/resurrection.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This has none of the hard edges of a movie like Little Miss Sunshine, but it does have a delightful quirkiness to it, with Rudd's performance holding it all together.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A rather conventional comedy, Our Idiot Brother ... [is] totally pleasant, warm, and occasionally very funny. Sometimes that's the kind of film we really need.

771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> More clever than laugh-out-loud funny, the comedy is mostly driven by our observations of Ned, who can't help screwing up the lives of his sisters one-by-one, despite his good intentions.

771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> A well-intentioned idealist clueless enough to make Forest Gump look streetwise.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It's the enormous likability of Paul Rudd as the title Idiot that really makes this movie work.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Unmistakably Little Miss Sunshine-y...a sunny sitcom of family dysfunction...
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> liltingly transcendent
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The emphasis is not so much on laughs, but on exploring familial relationships. It achieves some degree of success on both those counts, but the degree wasn't quite high enough for my taste.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> A surprisingly sweet comedy that utilizes the family dynamic a lot better than other films in the genre.

771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Wastes a cast of very talented comedic performers by giving them just about nothing funny to do, and sticking them in a plot in which every character is a moron, a moral monster or both.

771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A film that offers dumb fun, but in reality may be crazy like a fox.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Rudd has created a genuinely engaging character in the Candide-like Ned, but "Our Idiot Brother" gives him very little garden to cultivate.

771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> It's a shame to see Rudd given a role that lets him hit it out of the park in a movie that never comes close to matching him.

771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The laughs are consistent and occasionally outlandish, but more often, they arise out of recognizable family situations.

771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> It's mediocre in a passive, energy-sapping way midway between humdrum and ho-hum.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The comedy isn't always as crisp as it should be, but Peretz has the perfect partner in crime in Rudd.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The rhythms are gentle, the smiles plentiful, the chuckles frequent, with the overall effect about as pleasantly innocuous as the film's hero.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Peretz has figured out how to make a happy commercial contraption with eccentric flavoring.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The comedy's relaxed, moony rhythms imbue it with a certain charm, but can result in a certain stop-and-start awkwardness, too.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Our Idiot Brother is a feel-good movie for people who resist feel-good movies, a flawed vessel that nonetheless stays afloat by clinging to its buoyant star, Paul Rudd.

771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> In a world of aggravating "Little Fockers"-level shrillness, or "Hangover"-style nastiness, "Our Idiot Brother" - small, but satisfying - is a pretty smart cookie.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> "Our Idiot Brother" is made gently comic thanks to Rudd's fool-on-the-hill vibe and a quirky and effervescent supporting cast.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Rudd is at his best, imbuing Ned with a deep humanity and a surprisingly persuasive edge. And as the sisters, Banks, Deschanel and Mortimer never hit a wrong note.

771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Funny, sweet, and a little soft ... An endearing ensemble piece that goes down like the diet version of Mike Leigh's spectacular Happy-Go-Lucky.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> It's refreshing, this late in the summer, to find a hot weather comedy that doesn't hate its characters and embed them in scatology and sexual impossibilities.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> While too overtly modest to be a comedy game-changer, [it] is almost sufficiently feisty and entertaining to render the term 'a Sundance movie' something less than dread-inspiring.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Our Idiot Brother kept me laughing throughout.

771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> There's a gap of logic and emotion that's hard to overcome.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> If Our Idiot Brother clearly courts Gump-ian territory, its pattern finally bears a stronger resemblance to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> An airy, light-hearted and consistently fun dramedy.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A well-written, delightful throwback to the Frank Capra/Preston Sturges sensibility, in which the one who owns the least usually has the most.

771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> A fine addition to the dysfunctional family comedy genre.
771224856 <###> Our Idiot Brother <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Heavy on both the laughs and the heart.

771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Essentially this sequel is far too preoccupied with boobs, stroking the male ego and crass, old-fashioned jokes to deliver anything engaging or truly witty.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Flush this one away.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Man-worship and dated gross-out gags can't elevate the material above the terminally boring. Who knew?
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The film's belated sequel has the same director, three-quarters of its lead cast and one-third of its writing team, but in the intervening five years, all seem to have forgotten why the original worked and what it meant.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> This is the kind of movie that will make you want to go back in time -- to the moment before you made the rash decision to start watching it.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> This is asphyxiate-on-your-own popcorn unfunny, exhaustingly stupid and a waste of twelve quid.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> The result is 93 minutes of your life you'll never wish to revisit.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The relentless spitballing yields sporadic snorts, but with women reduced to walk-on titparts between stale knob gags, it absolutely feels like the bromance's final, desperate throbs ...
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> The only thing that crosses your mind after seeing this is whether it's possible to travel back around 93 minutes and opt to see something else.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Fans of the first film will note the problematic lack of balance; without Cusack's notably sour contribution, Hot Tub Time Machine 2 sinks in a sea of its own bodily fluids.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Steve Pink didn't add to the original with this sequel in terms of story depth or character development, but come on, the film is called Hot Tub Time Machine 2.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.1 <###> Choppy, tangentially related scenes follow upon one another, dragged further down by witless dialogue and nasty behavior.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> ...an embarrassment to all concerned.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.35 <###> I really liked the first one. This one...not so much.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Crass, homophobic, misogynistic sequel - pull the plug and empty the Jacuzzi!
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's raunchy, foul-mouthed and occasionally funny.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> The humor is seldom character-based: It's more a matter of actors saying whatever outrageous thing springs to mind at that moment.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Returning director Steve Pink and screenwriter Josh Heald re-create the goofball, quick-tempo chaos of their original film. It's a silly, gross-out frolic that's often irritating but somehow turns tolerable.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The 1980s are nowhere to be found in Hot Tub Time Machine 2, a bummer for those who still want their MTV.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Sans the original's redemptive nostalgia or any newfound cleverness, it's just a manic, flop-sweat-drenched mess.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 plays like a film in outline form, where the bullet points are all on the page, but no one has connected them together yet.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 is basically a sillier version of an already silly concept - but that doesn't mean it isn't fun.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 commits the two biggest sins of the dudebro comedy genre legitimized by the success of The Hangover series. The first is that this sequel exists at all.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> While the original was clever and funny from start to finish, this painfully written sequel offers the exact opposite and takes away any charm audience were expecting.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> It seems as if no one knew what they were doing here, or what they wanted to say, and so it's up to the cast to kill time riffing on each other.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Pretty much a total waste of time and energy.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> The water in the tub is still lukewarm and it's pretty disgusting in places but tepid or not, I got a few laughs out of it and the outtakes at the end were funny!
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> [I]t's pretty clear that Hot Tub Machine 2 is running on creative fumes...
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> I loved the first film, but if I could, I would travel back in time and tell my 2010 self to dial that review down a couple of notches. Just in case it somehow encouraged the making of this sequel.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> Unlike the original film that contained a nostalgic 1980s romp held together by funny central performances, this second helping is like a confused collection of outtakes.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> One of the most aggressively, grotesquely off-putting movies I have ever seen
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 is the proverbial turd in the Jacuzzi - you can't pin down who's responsible, but it's a floater that ruins the party.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> In the future, in the past, at all points along the space-time continuum, the Theory of the Teenage Male Mind throws everything out of whack.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> Place your odds on this easily capturing a spot on 2015's Worst Films list if not earning the top spot.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> Any way one spins it, this is a bad movie. It's cheap-looking. It's asinine. It's dull. It's thoroughly unsatisfying. And, at 93 minutes, the proceedings earn a whopping two laughs tucked inside a tidal wave of misery.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> The Platonic ideal of a sorta-welcome sequel no one needs. Like "Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay" or "Horrible Bosses 2" before it, "Hot Tub Time Machine 2" proves some bottles aren't built for much more than a single bolt of lightning.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Not that there were a ton of expectations for Hot Tub Time Machine 2, but however modest they were the film fails to meet them.

771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> An early candidate for worst sequel of 2015 and also worst movie.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Remember how bad you thought the original movie was going to be? That.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Compared with last time, the returning team of director Steve Pink and writer Josh Heald practically doodle the gang's motivations and worse, their surroundings.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Prediction: If you liked the original, you will probably enjoy a return soaking. If you did not tolerate that kind of idiocy the first time, I guarantee you will not want to see the sequel.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.0 <###> The sequel takes everything that was good about the first film - a raunchy, though affectionate, take on how guys look back on the moment when their lives went south - and makes it seem accidental.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> more or less a complete disaster
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> If you have to ask yourself whether this film is for you, it isn't.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.35 <###> You can only catch lightning in a bottle once with something called Hot Tub Time Machine, and John Cusack's buddies are drowning in this without him. Without Cusack, the trio lack warmth and grab at every penis joke they can.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.3 <###> "Hot Tub Time Machine 2" is a movie that didn't need to be made, and certainly doesn't need to be seen - not when you can rent the original and still feel good about yourself afterward.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> For those who liked the first movie and find a plethora of penis jokes hilarious, this is a fitting sequel. But others should stay away.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> It's just bad. It's boring, folks.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Proof that not all hit movies merit sequels.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 is the kid in class who makes fart noises for a quick laugh, only he doesn't stop for an hour and a half - and he never gets funnier.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.125 <###> A douchebaggery-bedazzled sack of misery.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> Josh Heald's script takes the easy way out, ending the film with a torrent of slapdash sentimentality.

771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> Returning director Steve Pink often simply shows his actors a prop -- a piece of furniture, say -- and asks them to make jokes about it.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> I hated Hot Tub Time Machine 2 so much I now can't even think about the first one without feeling annoyed.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> The smart plotting of the first film is completely gone; this time the script barely bothers with the central mystery, preferring to lurch from one unfunny set piece to another.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> The first movie was raunchy, but this one is just rude - with plenty of bodily fluids being flung around, and far too many jokes about genitals.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.35 <###> With humor that makes Bill & Ted seem intelligent, this sequel is pretty much garbage. We had to wait five years for this?
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Cusack didn't miss much.
771369273 <###> Hot Tub Time Machine 2 <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> At its best the series milks its inability to care much into absudist jokes -a blob of non-sequiturs where rules are made to be ignored and broken. But it's not often at its best.
12322 <###> The Sting II <###> Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Oliver Reed and Karl Malden are welcome presences, and Teri Garr is the winner on all feminine counts, but this isn't enough to save it.
12322 <###> The Sting II <###> Comedy <###> 0.2 <###> The film was scripted by David S. Ward, who also wrote the original but added nothing new or special to this sequel.
17462 <###> There's Something About Mary <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Farrelly bros' classic is full of gross-out laughs.
17462 <###> There's Something About Mary <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> The movie managed to walk a line between raunchy, gross-out comedy and a romantic comedy.
17462 <###> There's Something About Mary <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Gauche, garish, and gross, a prime example of the coarsening of our culture and of the art of comedy in film. It's also pretty darn funny. [Blu-ray]
17462 <###> There's Something About Mary <###> Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A romantic gross-out comedy: What a concept!
17462 <###> There's Something About Mary <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> ...Dillon's Pat, in an effort to win Mary's affections, poorly attempts to ape her compassion for the handicapped by referring to them as "retards" and "goofy bastards...

17462 <###> There's Something About Mary <###> Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> When it's not mean spirited, tastelessness can be riotously funny. And this is a gag-a-thon of hugely funny proportions.
17462 <###> There's Something About Mary <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> You may also want to keep [a] washcloth handy, just to stifle those embarrassing aftershocks of laughter.
17462 <###> There's Something About Mary <###> Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Though the plot of this film is trivial, what makes it succeed is the sheer outlandishness of the comedy.
17462 <###> There's Something About Mary <###> Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The Farrellys work so hard to be outrageous they end up sacrificing story, characters, even comedy, to achieve maximum gross-out.

17462 <###> There's Something About Mary <###> Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Mary is reminiscent of the crazed, hellzapoppin' style of the Marx Brothers.
136192136 <###> Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Art House & International <###> 0.8 <###> Any reprisal of the Yojimbo character is a welcome one, even if the pairing of these two cinematic legends didn't quite produce as much chemistry as hoped for
771375916 <###> Tiger & Bunny: The Rising <###> Anime & Manga <###> 0.7 <###> Tiger & Bunny: The Rising is like a mixture of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Iron Man, and G-Force. If you're a fan of big superhero blockbusters, then you'll likely have a blast with Tiger & Bunny: The Rising.
321728189 <###> Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Pretty much the end of Universal's horror line as a home for even the vaguest kind of serious filmmaking.
321728189 <###> Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.8 <###> "The last great Universal Frankenstein movie, despite the overstuffed title."
321728189 <###> Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.5 <###> It starts off really well, stalls a little toward the middle, goes bonkers for one really odd musical number, and then derails completely at the end.
321728189 <###> Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Great title, tepid movie.
321728189 <###> Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man <###> Horror;Classics;Science Fiction & Fantasy <###> 0.4 <###> Doesn't deliver all that much of what the title promises.
770734181 <###> Ash Wednesday <###> Drama <###> 0.25 <###> Another in the long string of mediocre films by Taylor.
770734181 <###> Ash Wednesday <###> Drama <###> 0.4 <###> This is not a male chauvinist's conception of a woman, but her hairdresser's, full of envy, awe and superficial compassion.
770734181 <###> Ash Wednesday <###> Drama <###> 0.5 <###> The whole movie, indeed, feels longer than it is. It's 15 minutes short of two hours, and still it takes forever to be over.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> Delivers the western genre goods along with generous laughs and some impressive animation--and some brazenly warped sensibilities.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> Amusing in small doses, marketed to kids and not really FOR kids. An undeserving Oscar winner.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> Meditations on identity make Rango unique, and somewhat special, in the current animated film landscape.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.625 <###> If the writers had dared to step a little outside the borders of the western formula or if they'd even just shaken up the old formula a bit, this really could have been something special, but sadly, it just ends up being pretty standard.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> Depp isn't as annoying in this as he has been elsewhere.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> Packed with in-jokes, great characters and an offbeat anti-hero, Rango is the perfect shake-up the animated genre needed.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> At long last, a spaghetti Western for the kiddie set -- and one that doesn't sell older viewers short.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> An animated walk on the dry side
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> Unfocused and absolutely scattered...
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.7 <###> Kudos to the director for making it as oddball as it could get away with.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> It's one of those movies that will reveal more and more to youngsters as they rewatch it in years to come... and that's the best kind of film.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> For good or for bad, this is not your run-of-the-mill animated feature.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.85 <###> Rango is Disney by way of Hunter S. Thompson, Chinatown recast with a lizard, Blazing Saddles with existential angst, Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns romanticallyspoofed. Rango is both weird and wonderful.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> This chameleon stands out.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Rango is as gloriously cinematic as it is witty and ironic.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> OK, kids, who's ready for an animated version of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"?
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> A smart, satirical, and expertly animated adventure aimed at adults and children alike.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> ...reminds one of how special animation can be.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Brilliantly bonkers, this animated Western weirdo should scare little kids while dazzling adults with its inspired approach to demented homage.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> Inventive visuals and lively voice cast lift this finely animated film above the fray. So it's a shame that the story feels both random and predictable.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Any serious, dark-minded child who's up on High Noon, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Chinatown, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the writings of Carlos Castaneda will really find their precociousness rewarded.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 1.0 <###> 'Rango' is one of the best works of literature I've enjoyed for many years. 'Rango' is one of the best family films I've seen in years. 'Rango' is one of the best Westerns I've ever seen.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.7 <###> Going in, I was expecting much more standard children's fare, not an existential undertaking with shout-outs to everything from Chinatown to Don Quixote.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.125 <###> Just when you thought you'd seen everything, here comes Chinatown, the animated version.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> Una pelicula sumamente entretenida, y especialmente disfrutable por un publico adulto y cinefilo, que es todo un homenaje al universo del spaghetti western que inmortalizaran Sergio Leone (director), Clint Eastwood (actor) y Ennio Morricone (compositor).
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> Rango is a precision-built, artistically rich and intelligently entertaining movie that deserves to become a hit and a classic.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 1.0 <###> Channeling spaghetti westerns, Cervantes, Castaneda, and a dash of CHINATOWN as refracted through the visual sensibilities of Dali, it is a fiendishly clever concretion of high- and low-brow in a story that is both vision quest and farce
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> Rango a dynamic tribute to a lost genre.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> Sergio Leone meets 'The Shakiest Gun in the West' in this odd movie about a chameleon who -- credit the filmmakers for their cleverness -- doesn't blend in.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> It is not a coincidence that the mayor (Ned Beatty) sounds like the evil John Huston character from Chinatown as the film makes an obvious nod toward that film classic.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> what it loses in coherence and dexterity it gains in pure sensationalism, whether it be visual, verbal, or narrative
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> Roger Deakins (True Grit) may have just lost the Academy Award for a criminal ninth time, but his talent as a cinematographer is one of the secret weapons in the first CG movie from live-action director Gore Verbinski.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> If the art of the mashup is what passes for originality these days, then Rango is a creative tour de force.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> The first film of 2011 that I can recommend without reservations.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Existential, inventive and irreverent
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.7 <###> full review at Movies for the Masses
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> "Rango" is proof that not all new animated films need to go the gimmicky way of 3-D.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> The stunning overall look -- which tips its ten-gallon hat at western classicists like John Ford and Sergio Leone while winking slyly at Salvador Dali -- qualifies as a work of art in its own right.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.7 <###> The film unspools as an admittedly bizarre blending of an animated adventure film for kids and a meta-comedy about a character who must morph from being a fictitious hero to being a real one.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Not often does one see an animated family film where someone talks about experiencing a "paradigm shift" or says, "I think your metaphor broke my spleen."
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Very funny, packed with solid action, animated with a remarkable degree of care and creativity, and delivered with a breathless sense of energy.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> There's absolutely no arguing that it comes from the same mentality of test-marketing and formula and commercial calculation as most American animation does right now.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Even if the story about a dust bowl town's diminished water supply isn't quite thrilling enough, the film makes up for it with wacked-out dream sequences and a general oddball tone
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.7 <###> In the end, Rango, despite its many pleasures, is a bit too smart for its own good.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.7 <###> It's very, very interesting but it's sort of like you've got to have that magic combination: you've got to have looks and heart.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Rango is an impressive and wonderfully strange film.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> There are some great sight gags and the script has some good lines, but there aren't enough of them - and the plot is rather slight and predictable.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> The Western isn't dead. It's just become more animated... literally.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> Fantastical tale of the reptile that conquered the Wild West.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 1.0 <###> Rango is like Chinatown meets A Fistful of Dollars meets a Geico commercial. And it's totally awesome.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.4 <###> This one is for Johnny Depp devotees only. The animation is good but the overall effect of the movie is dull.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> I just don't know if we'll see a film as smart or fun or overwhelmingly rich as Rango for the rest of the year.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> A film so committed (and respectful) to the western flubs by basing itself on another style.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> The movie basically adheres to the conventions of the genre as well as the Western spoofs made popular by comedians such as Bob Hope, Abbott and Costello, and Mel Brooks in "Blazing Saddles."
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.4 <###> See Gnomeo & Juliet instead.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 1.0 <###> Visualmente espetacular (...), e repleto de momentos que surgem poeticos de tao evocativos.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> Hypnotic. I'd be shocked if there is a better animated film in 2011.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> This is a smart, hip comedy that works for adults and youngsters alike.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> The first animated film from ILM is also the first memorable motion picture of 2011.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> There's more visual wit in Gore Verbinski's Rango than the last two Pixar films combined.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> There are a couple of frightening sequences with a rattlesnake and a hawk that may scare small children, but all ends well. Rango will rope you in.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Kids don't always need primary colors and fluffy bunnies and 3-D effects. Sometimes a scrawny, ugly chameleon in the dirty Old West will do.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> A work that in its finest moments comes across as a Coen Brothers film with anthropomorphic animals instead of flesh-and-blood humans.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Anytime you have a rattlesnake attached to a machine gun and voiced by Bill Nighy, you can sign me up. Cleverly written, not for kids and not in 3D. Go see it. Now.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> Admirably ambitious animated ode to Spaghetti Westerns featuring a Johnny Depp-voiced lizard as the unlikely hero.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> It's almost like Sergio Leone was adapting a Kenneth Grahame story.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> Adults and slightly older children should have a great time.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> All in all, Rango is a freaky and fun ride, with some tasty philosophical asides and references for the grownups to chew on.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> With his first animated feature, Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski shows ambitions considerably beyond producing the usual standard of most children's fare. To put it plainly, Rango is one weird movie.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> Yes, [there are] enough nods to other sources to make Rango a bobblehead. But the movie, and much of John Logan's writing, is still pretty durn clever.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Rango might be the first animated feature film from Industrial Light & Magic, but in many ways it's easy to forget you are watching an actual cartoon.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8212121 <###> Amusing and thrilling albeit slightly overlong with dazzling visuals and clever nods to classic Westerns.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> He is "sinking deeper into the guacamole of his own deception," says the owl who leads a Mexican mariachi band that serves as the story's Greek chorus - a description that shows you just how willfully weird are the goings-on.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Guns and deep thoughts make this best for older kids.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> beautiful yet hollow, the first real missed opportunity of 2011.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> Some good bits about the nature of heroism, but not enough to elevate Rango to the ranks of Pixar. Still, when viewed as a silly comedy-adventure, it's enjoyable.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 1.0 <###> A defiantly weird and unexpectedly charming effort that could easily feel at home at both matinees and on the midnight movie circuit.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.7 <###> A delightfully strange, if somewhat inconsistent, animated western.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> No tightly-plotted Pixar masterpiece, Rango is its own insane expression, a nervy bundle of outrageous daring, jangled and tangled to a free-wheeling fare-thee-well. Green hasn't been this much fun since early Shrek.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> Parents will be nudging aside their children to check out the thoroughly mature western known as Rango
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> I suspect the young'uns will...take a shine to the hero of Rango: a chameleon that's part Kermit the Frog, part street-corner kook (and all Johnny Depp, who supplies the often hilarious voice).
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> A damn fine western, an entertaining throwback to classic B-pictures that pays clever tribute to its predecessors.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> Rango's not just a kiddie-flick (though it has enough silly slapstick to qualify as a pretty good one). It's a real movie lover's movie, conceived as a Blazing Saddles-like comic commentary on genre that's as back-lot savvy as it is light in the saddle.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> Clear proof that a great director can work in any genre and medium and produce great results.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 1.0 <###> It is only the first week of March and we are still getting over last year's award season. But the race for 2011's Best Animated Feature may have just begun. And may have just ended.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Rango is clever and entertaining. Not for the very young perhaps, but ideal for teens and adults.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> As animation, this is top class, and a mile away from the orthodox. Some of the detail is terrific, and the screenplay is sharply intelligent.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> The strangeness is off the scale in a kooky concoction that might have been hatched at the bottom of a bong. Then again, what do you expect with Johnny involved?
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> An ultra-quirky animated Western with a vocal tour de force by Johnny Depp that's quite unlike anything I've ever seen.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> A sun-baked symphony of rust and dust, Rango has a spiky, unsentimental appeal, sending out slightly risque jokes to parents while staying safely out of the danger zone for kids.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> The whole enterprise is redolent of past movies (and drug trips), yet it somehow whiffs fresh.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> Nothing about this witty, inventive film obeys the rules.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> Without double-crossing the kiddie contingent, "Rango" is iconic like a spaghetti Western, smart like a '70s conspiracy thriller and lively like a Coen brothers comedy.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.7 <###> It's a one-of-a-kind film that could have faltered in numerous places and yet somehow hangs together and works. Best of all? It's not in 3D.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> Frantically and refreshingly fun.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> One of my favorites of this young year and among the most unique features I've seen from an American animation house in recent memory.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> Wry, genial, and not at all interested in jumping on the bandwagon of flash-in-the-pan pop-cultural hipness, "Rango" holds an eclectic eye for finding beauty in the unusual.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 1.0 <###> From start to finish this is a wonderful and immensely creative animated film about a loser who arises to the challenges faced in a town without water.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.7 <###> It is Depp, however, who really nails this thing by simply blending in with all the other voice talent and characters and not reverting to the oversized Captain Jack Sparrow swagger.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Gore Verbinski has created a truly left field, oddball, hilarious film that again, like Toy Story 3, proves animation is today's most exciting cinema form.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.4 <###> A possible cult hit, it's too self-indulgent to find a mass audience.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> Verbinski has made an animated feature unlike any other on the current mainstream landscape: For a big-budget animated picture, Rango sure is an odd little varmint.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> For a movie about finding one's identity, Rango spends an awful lot of time searching for one of its own.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> The film itself is a magically strange hybrid, a spoofy computer-animated Western acted out by anthropomorphic desert creatures.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> It is not self-conscious knowingness that drives Rango but rather a quirky and sincere enthusiasm for all the strange stuff that has piled up in the filmmakers' heads over the years.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.625 <###> Say what you will about 'Rango,' the computer-animated Western riding hard on Johnny Depp doing the voice of a lizard - just don't call it business as usual.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> It's Verbinski's trust in the audience to get his jokes and pop-culture references that makes "Rango" such an engaging ride.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.75 <###> The film features some of the most astounding computer animation ever, and, thanks to a slew of terrific voice actors who are obviously having a great time, the film is wildly, weirdly amusing.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Sharp-edged, surreal, and often astonishing in its giddy creativity.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> In a world choked with animated films -- the good, the bad and the ugly -- it's hard to be either original or great. Yet director Gore Verbinski has done both -- and without 3-D...
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> It's an exuberant, audacious love letter to spaghetti westerns, masquerading as a kiddie cartoon. And it delivers deliciously on both levels.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.625 <###> What makes this unhinged, wildly self-conscious comedy-adventure more than a two-hour gimmick is an inspired vocal performance by Verbinski's "Pirates of the Caribbean" star, Johnny Depp.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.625 <###> You know those animated films that have bits that the parents will enjoy? Rango is mostly those bits.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.625 <###> "Rango'' is a highly watchable but somewhat frustrating mix of sloppy plotting, rascally attitude, and Big Action.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> Consistently plays like an adult movie in uncomfortably fitting family-friendly clothes.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Rango is the revitalising injection of new blood that animated cinema didn't know it needed.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> absolutely wonderful
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.875 <###> A neon-colored, sun-baked fantasia that's part Western spoof and part surrealist jag through the desert with Johnny Depp as our theatrically unhinged, reptilian tour guide, Rango is anything but your standard kiddie animated flick.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> Well, visually Rango looks excellent. Then characters start talking.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> It's all technically brilliant, but maybe lacking a little in charm and true wit.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 1.0 <###> "Rango" is some kind of a miracle: An animated comedy for smart moviegoers, wonderfully made, great to look at, wickedly satirical, and (gasp!) filmed in glorious 2-D.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.5 <###> It coasts on strangeness only so long before the novelty wears off.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> It's a droll and invigorating alternative to the Disney and Dreamworks models. At the same time, you wish that Verbinski had a tighter grip on his storyline.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Rango turns out to be a master of adaptability and good will in the end, in fact, an educating and entertaining little ambassador for all with an addictive personality.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> This digimated all-animal western borders on the inspired.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> There are some wonderful things in 'Rango': the dialogue is witty, the animation is dizzying and the action is stunningly choreographed.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Not many animated escapades aim to please such a broad audience. Even the poo jokes are sophisticated.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> Visually inventive and enjoyably quirky...
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> It's refreshing to see an animated movie that doesn't look as though the idea for the Happy Meal came first.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.625 <###> While Depp turns his bug-eyed reptile into a charismatic character, the plot gets lost in a maze of tangents and the story has too many tasteless jokes -- like a prostate gag -- that are not kid-friendly.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> The most satisfying non-Pixar animated movie to emerge in some time.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> A terrific Saturday matinee for pretty much anyone.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> "...a fleet, quirky, computer-animated feature that I found ingenious, charming and almost entirely engaging."
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.9 <###> This reteaming of Depp with his Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski looks like a lock to emerge as the first genuine blockbuster of 2011.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.8 <###> Western myths infuse with the story of a lizard facing an existential crisis. His name? Rango.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> It's ultimately a pastiche-by-numbers and doesn't live up to its full potential, but as a visual treat and one of Depp's better vehicles of recent years, it delivers the basic goods.
770805425 <###> Rango <###> Action & Adventure;Animation;Kids & Family <###> 0.6 <###> Spoofs such kiddie favourites as Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, the mystical writings of Carlos Castaneda, and Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy.
771372038 <###> The Foxy Merkins <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Here's another irresistible no-budget pic from the woman who brought you Codependent Lesbian Space Alien Seeks Same.
771372038 <###> The Foxy Merkins <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> While much of it is quite funny, the film ends up feeling like a good comedy sketch stretched out unnecessarily to a feature-length.
771372038 <###> The Foxy Merkins <###> Action & Adventure;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> When The Foxy Merkins does hit it's stride, which is more often than not, the comedy reaches near-brilliance (Alex Karpovsky's fleeting cameo as a mumbling "foxy merkins" dealer is funny on so many levels).
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Absurd and quirky at times, The Matador plays like a "Bizarro World" variation of a James Bond film. It's beautifully shot, strange and deeply meaningful.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Brosnan's sleazy, broken-spirited hitman Julian Noble nabs the spotlight in Richard Shepard's generally pleasing comic thriller.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> ...a hip and hilarious dark comedy.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Brosnan's work as a monster who'd like to become human, but has no idea how, is painfully funny.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.25 <###> A chemistry-free buddy flick.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> Nice characters and situations: unfortunately, writer-director Richard Shephard didn't have much idea where to go with them.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> But the gold star here goes to Brosnan. His performance digs deep into Julian's soul and it is that depth that makes the performance stand out.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> in an ideal world, The Matador would be the movie to watch on a late Friday afternoon to start relaxing for the weekend
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> ... it does give Brosnan a chance to show his comic skills in an edgy comedy that is perhaps not dark enough for the subject matter.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Brosnan is performing his own high-wire act here, daring us not to like his sleazy, vulgar, insensitive, immoral character.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Casting Greg Kinnear (As Good As It Gets) to play the straight man to Brosnan's wacked-out whack-man was a stroke of genius.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> An amusing and original comedy that skips along with the quirky, charismatic shake-shake-shake of maracas.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Pierce Brosnan oferece, aqui, um dos melhores desempenhos de sua carreira.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Demands to be loved in spite of itself and refuses to sugar-coat its characters for its audience. And that'll make it a love it or leave it film; there'll be no sitting on the fence after seeing this.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.9 <###> It's quirky (everyone says so, but it's absolutely accurate) and chock full of real live heart and truth and human connection.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Even though it's a little too enamored with its edge and so obviously symbolic it could be called "The Metaphor," Brosnan is at his best, and the movie's got more on its mind than guns, giggles and a weenie-meets-warrior vibe.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> The Matador is a delight. Brosnan displays a wonderful flair for comedy, while Kinnear is perfectly in tune as his shocked, straight-arrow foil.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Brosnan walks the line between sympathy and repulsion as a cartoony lonely assassin
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> It's almost as if Pierce Brosnan asked for a role as far from the debonair and cool-under-pressure James Bond as possible... and we're so glad he did.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> Brosnan gives his most liberated and likeable performance since his Remington Steele days.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> A constantly entertaining, invariably good-looking, bittersweet black comedy that's actually a lot more sentimental than it seems to think.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> A breezy entertainment -- perhaps too much so.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Its best trait [is] the unique ability to walk the fine line, as Spinal Tap's David St. Hubbins would say, between stupid and clever.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> This warmly-inviting black comedy plays like a David Mamet remake of Pulp Fiction.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> ... Redefines the possibilities of the buddy movie.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.4 <###> ... a dark comedy that is missing the laughs to be funny and the darkness to be, well, dark.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Kinnear and Brosnan pull it off perfectly.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> ... one of the smarter films out right now.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> ... a wicked comedy with just the mildest amount of pathos to season the blend.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> An entertaining caper anchored by great acting and a couple terrific plot twists.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Pierce Brosnan's 'facilitator of fatalities' is a great character, but the story that houses him is as ersatz as the recording of 'In the Wee Small Hours' the assassin plays on the businessman's turntable (that's not Sinatra singing).
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> You can almost feel Brosnan's glee as he allows himself to let it all hang out, both figuratively and (almost) literally.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> [It] comes across... as a somewhat incoherent story told by a stranger in a hotel lobby bar.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Though violent and funny, and often both at the same time, the film by writer-director Richard Shepard is also a subtle and slightly skewed inversion of Brosnan's suave image.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> You've never met anybody quite like the The Matador, even though you may think you have Pierce Brosnan pegged.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> After you see this delightful black comedy about a hit man gone to seed, you'll never again pigeonhole Brosnan as a tuxedo-clad sophisticate with nerves of steel.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Whenever you think you know where the story is headed, Shepard unleashes another hard twist. Much of his excellence comes not in his storytelling but in the way he sets up situations that ooze with comic conflict.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A refreshingly tetchy indie wrapped in mainstream clothing.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> Weird, but watchable.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> An almost perfect mix of heartbreak and humour.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.8 <###> How the two men become friends is as wildly funny as it is improbable, but that's the joy of this dark comedy.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Never as good as you'd hoped or as bad as you'd feared, The Matador is one of those of up-and-down experiences.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.7 <###> Une fort sympathique comedie dramatique sur l'amitie, les valeurs, le prix du succes et les racines des individus.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Buoyant and jazzy, The Matador is like one of those '60s capers where Michael Caine was surrounded by beautiful women and Alfa Romeos.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> Brosnan and Kinnear are a bullish odd couple.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6 <###> This film is not so much a thriller as a comedy of bad manners. Action is kept to a minimum, but the conversation is what is interesting.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> As exceptional as [Brosnan and Kinnear] are... writer-director Richard Shepard's film is ultimately the formula buddy picture that one would expect from the premise.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> [The film] forces the viewer to work too hard to buy its buddy pairing (Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear), at times preventing the movie from being the goof it ought to be.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> It's painful to watch as the movie basically destroys itself in the second half, slipping from its elegant thriller setup to tired sitcom shenanigans.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.375 <###> Shepard's story isn't tight enough to rein in Brosnan, who's emotionally all over the map as the globetrotting assassin.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> The Matador is a superbly cast story that clearly marks Shepard as a filmmaker to watch.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.6875 <###> A slight, but amusing character-driven buddy comedy.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.625 <###> The film has a lot going for it, particularly Brosnan in the title role. What it does not have is much novelty.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> Movie fans have seen any number of stories about hitmen, but it's a pretty good bet that even the most jaded of cynics will be unable to detect just where The Matador is going.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> Unevenly paced yet darkly funny and consistently intriguing.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.5 <###> The Matador strives for an airy, merry amorality, but it never quite achieves liftoff, though at times it comes close.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.875 <###> In The Matador, Pierce Brosnan plays another man with license to kill, yet he gives a performance wildly unlike his suave superspy. In fact, it may be his best role yet.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> This comedy is as dark as it is oddly unpredictable -- and sporadically hilarious.
24471 <###> The Matador <###> Drama;Action & Adventure;Mystery & Suspense;Comedy <###> 0.75 <###> A tart comedy about economic duress and the mind-set of a soon-to-be downsized hit man, it's also a salty celebration of the romance and necessity of friendship.
