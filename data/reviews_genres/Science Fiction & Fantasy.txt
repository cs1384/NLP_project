0.7 While it's not possible to fix everything, series co-creator Brad Wright did a bang-up job putting a new polish on this installment.
0.8 The fantasy elements are so seamlessly blended with real elements. There is very little disbelief by the characters, and you want to believe yourself by the end.
0.6 Apart from the ecofriendly message, we have, as always, Miyazaki's magnificently inventive animation, which is almost enough to carry the day.
0.6 There's still plenty of gorgeous eye-candy to keep adults going if they've taken their kids along for some unthreatening entertainment.
0.8 Let's say you have a five-year-old child who's not all caught up in the details of boring, mundane reality. Here's that kid's new favorite movie.
0.8 A sweet love story about a boy and his fish, Ponyo is a weird yet wonderful children's fantasy, and marks another milestone in the career of Hayao Miyazaki.
0.6 His antediluvian underwater creatures are gorgeous, a world removed from Finding Nemo, his sweeping tides and smashing tsunamis are a patchwork of colour and technique.
0.81 That rare children's movie that actually taps into the unique imaginative power of a child's mind.
0.6 Though far from Studio Ghibli's best film, Ponyo is still a magical experience.
0.875 Significantly, Miyazaki creates realistic, valid and memorably attractive characters, such as the heroic-vulnerable-patient-nurturing-tough mother, Tina Fey.
0.9 While the animation in Ponyo is simplistic, even crude by many people's standards, there is no denying the film's dazzling color palette, masterful attention to detail and dizzying imagination.
0.4 Shouldn't an anime' auteur of Hayao Miyazaki's stature avoid a story about a sea creature interacting with a human child? Isn't that "Finding Nemo?"
0.8 Doesn't commit itself to mining our deeper feelings, and as such it feels much more geared to younger viewers; but with that comes dazzling displays of drawn and painted visuals, full of color, life.
0.4 Though Ponyo contains images so haunting that it's hard to dismiss altogether, this is one of Miyazaki's feeblest efforts.
0.7 While it continually stimulates our imagination, it's a little too odd to really resonate.
0.8 Perfect family entertainment with a subtle environmental message.
0.8 Miyazaki's back, and still a force of nature. A weird, wonderful aquatic romp, Ponyo is also a meditation on the state of this blue planet. Catch it.
0.8 We're drawn under the waves of the sea to a hidden enclave of neon-hued aqualife more vibrant, surreal and enchanting than any of the floating 3D whatsits in 'Avatar'.
0.8 A fantastic looking, inventive and well-acted children's film, but a children's film nonetheless - and that's all it was ever intended to be.
0.8 As usual, Miyazaki treads a thin line between intuitive, unshackled fantasy and simply seeming to makes things up as he goes along, but there is never a dull moment in the film's imagery.
0.8 An arresting work from an unmistakable film-making personality.
0.8 A simple tale, less freighted by foreboding than Miyazaki's recent output. In any case, storytelling is less important to him than mood or texture. His films are dream waltzes, all liquid motion and mysterious turbulences.
0.8 Ponyo is The Little Mermaid, Finding Nemo and Fantasia, all wrapped up in one fin-tastic movie, and guaranteed to hold the attention of the most CG-addled five year old.
0.8 Bar the climactic dip, another Ghibli charmer that finds story, subject matter and style in freewheeling harmony. You haven't seen the sea until you've seen it through Miyazaki's goggles.
0.8 This is a million miles away from the garish and crude cartoons that American studios often churn out, and serves as a reminder that animated films can be imaginative, enchanting and exciting while still telling a sweet, good-hearted story.
0.8 [Miyazaki's] dream-like visuals which sparkle in the deep blue sea.
0.8 Absurdly delightful, a prestidigitation of line and colour.
0.6 No animator captures the movement of tides and the deep physics of the sea as lyrically as Miyazaki, and the story's themes of rejuvenation and ecological balance carry a highly topical edge.
0.8 It may be a feelgood story but it's the stunning animation and the director's imagination that take the eye.
1.0 If you want to see something suitable for all ages that will dazzle you sideways and remind you of the awesome power of animation done right, you should see this.
1.0 Be bold enough to watch someone color outside the lines on purpose
0.8 The underwater scenes are as rich and teeming as Miyazaki's boundless imagination; little Ponyo in her human form, joyfully wobbling around on her newly sprouted legs, is a pure delight.
0.8 Beautifully animated, utterly charming adventure with a strong voice cast, delightful characters and an emotionally engaging, if bonkers, storyline.
0.9 Ponyo is a delight, so long as you accept it for what it is... an empowering, completely upbeat wonder-tale.
0.75 Minor Miyazaki to be sure, this film pales in comparison to many of his recent features.
0.75 Miyazaki refuses to be dismissed
0.8 lacks any real sense of conflict or danger. It makes up for it. . . with a delightfully absurd internal logic that is perfectly keyed into the way small children see the world
0.5 Hayao Miyazaki is off his game with this film that has weaker art and animation than his usual films and a script that needed another draft or two.
0.5 Ponyo is something of a disappointment. Leaving aside the plot deficiencies and storytelling awkwardness, Mr. Miyazaki's latest simply doesn't look good.
0.8 Miyazaki effortlessly combines the marvellous and the mundane in his cinema. Visually, Ponyo is an imaginative, exhilarating work, but its vigour and energy are achieved with surprising simplicity.
0.8 It is a delight, this film. There is so much imagination at work here.
0.8 Miyazaki has come up with another memorable film in Ponyo, which is roughly inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid... it's incredibly beautiful as Miyazaki explores an amazing world of sea creatures and human beings.
0.8 It's one of Miyazaki's funniest and most intimate films so far, partly because of the engaging matter-of-factness with which he marries the extravagantly fantastic with the comforting realities of everyday life.
1.0 Lately, when I want to smile, I just think of Ponyo.
1.0 Heralds a return to the child-like wonder of Miyazaki's enduring My Neighbor Totoro. And what do you know? It's another masterpiece.
0.75 Compared to the animated garbage that typically passes through stateside theaters, it's practically a godsend.
1.0 The sight of the giddy and newly bipedal Ponyo racing atop the waves of a magically roiling flood may be the happiest and most memorable image of the movie year.
0.8 The film's pleasures are immensely simple, but this does not make them less real or wonderful.
0.75 The film's joys are numerous, and most of them are small and simple. To start with, the animation -- all hand-drawn -- is simply breathtaking.
0.625 I sure like Miyazaki's visual style, but could he for once make a movie that actually made sense? Or have realistic characters, like a mother who wouldn't leave her 5 year alone during an extremely dangerous storm?
0.875 ..something like Finding Nemo and The Little Mermaid - if Nemo and Ariel had gotten together to ingest some new variety of aquatic shrooms.
1.0 Ponyo towers over this summer of empty toy-related blockbusters. It will end up as one of the best films in American release this year.
0.875 For those who love 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke,' as I do, here's another Hayao Miyazaki tale of friendship and fantasy.
0.8 Visually stunning, it's a fantastical, enchanting charmer that's bound to delight children and adults alike.
0.7 Not the spectacle that Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away are, Ponyo's beautiful, hand-drawn storybook pastels, mesmerising swirls of colourful action and sweet message of friendship are a gentle delight.
0.75 His twisted version of Finding Nemo meets Splash, the movie won't go down as one of his best, but it's still better than 90 percent of animation out there.
0.9 Some may find it too childish, but the movie's innocence is infectious, and Miyazaki's artistry utterly transporting.
0.9 In a Summer of senseless mayhem and underwhelming efforts, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is majestic. It easily matches (and in many cases, surpasses) the best the genre has to offer.
0.4 Probably the most saccarine horror film I've seen in years.
0.6 Trippy in the right way, and wholly enchanting.
0.875 This exquisite pastel-colored, eye-popping example of hand-drawn animation is still very Japanese, aimed most specifically at children around the world -- but with a storytelling sophistication that adults will savor.
0.5 Miyazaki's artwork can be lovely -- and the delicate, watery colors of Ponyo are particularly well done -- but he's still a slave to the genre's peculiar traditions.
1.0 Five minutes into this magical film you'll be making lists of the individuals of every age you can expose to the very special mixture of fantasy and folklore, adventure and affection, that make up the enchanted vision of Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki.
0.6 Ponyo is a visually arresting work by an anime master, and both cute enough and suspenseful enough to keep pre-schoolers in their seats.
0.875 You watch a Miyazaki film with the pie-eyed, gape-mouthed awe of a child being read the most fantastic story and suddenly transported to places previously beyond the limits of imagination. It's quite a trip.
0.8 'Ponyo' is a worthy piece of work from an artist who takes his work and his audience seriously.
0.875 Miyazaki works marvels. Sit back and behold.
0.75 As beautiful as Ponyo is to the eye, the movie -- thanks in part to a spotty English-language adaptation -- is sometimes a bit grating to the ear and confusing to the brain.
0.75 It's very much a charming kids' film, created by a master of animation.
1.0 The 68-year-old filmmaker shows that he's at the peak of his skills, both as a visual artist and a storyteller.
0.875 Hayao Miyazaki's magical Ponyo blends fantasy with just a drop of reality, and the result is irresistible.
0.875 A bright tale of wonder and connection, Ponyo is a reminder that a G rating needn't be a "little kid" designation.
0.75 Disney has done an unusually fine job of Americanizing Ponyo with a delicate script by "E.T." writer Melissa Mathison and warm, expressive voice work. Now, I just hope it doesn't fall on deaf ears.
0.625 The film is visually stunning, however, with a A-list cast of voices that include Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, and Tina Fey.
0.75 It's a wonderful place that Miyazaki creates, an alternatively sweet and savage world that defies physics and common sense, as imaginative and impossible in its own way as Jules Verne's sci-fi fantasies or Maurice Sendak's animal kingdom.
0.6 Those who consider Miyazaki a filmmaking master will probably consider this another one of his masterpieces.
0.8 Miyazaki's stunning adventure is geared to younger kids.
0.85 The type of glorious filmmaking and storytelling that should appeal to everyone ... a wonderful and magical film that should be seen and enjoyed as a family.
1.0 Hayao Miyazaki proves that he is not only a master animator but also a master storyteller. Ponyo is easily one of the best films -- animated or live action -- of the year.
0.85 Sometimes it's enough to just sit back and let a beautiful work of animation wash over you, letting the troubles of the world slide past as the pictures take you out of this world. Ponyo is just that sort of film.
0.9 When the ocean rises in this wonderful movie, each leaping wave stares out at us with a baleful eye as if in watchful and worried wait.
0.875 Wondrous, weird, and sweetly innocent, Ponyo is a tale bursting with love, which is recommendation enough for the young and the young at heart.
0.75 you get a psychedelic, visually stunning film with a Japanese flavor, instead of one with pop culture flavor (and no talking dogs or balloons).
0.825 A magical, uplifting and visually stunning film that's exhilarating for kids and adults simultaneously.
0.75 Even though Ponyo is not one of Miyazaki's great masterpieces (at least from a narrative perspective), it is so beautiful and immersive that it's hard to imagine grown ups not losing themselves in it.
0.7 Ponyo will sure make you long for the days of hand-drawn animation.
0.7 Accompanying adults will likely find themselves just as enthralled as their little ones.
1.0 "Ponyo" is the kind of dazzling cinematic experience that will resonate in the hearts and minds of anyone who sees it for a long time afterwards.
0.875 A good number of Miyazaki's fans will be disappointed by what looks like a step back, but the relaxed simplicity of the new film eventually works its effortless magic.
1.0 We are truly dealing with a master.
0.875 With its ever-shifting world and palpable sense of magic, Ponyo captures the wonder of being a child.
0.75 Miyazaki fans who are expecting the deeper themes in this may be disappointed. And as good as it looks, it's not career defining work, it's only merely good.
0.6 A charming and enchanting mystical fairy tale about a goldfish who becomes a girl and a little boy who loves her and introduces her with pride to his world of wonders.
0.6 A loose adaptation of The Little Mermaid that's full of fantastic visuals and genuine whimsy, but a little lax when it comes to plot logic or meaningful themes.
0.75 A lovely and unique feast for the eyes and the heart.
0.75 If you've never experienced a Miyazaki movie, here's your chance to try one. Come on in. The water's fine.
0.75 Nothing in the great animation of a Miyazaki movie stays cute for long. Not the ocean, not the trees, not the critters that live in them. Change is constant but rarely natural.
0.7 comes from a great line of Miyazaki heroines
1.0 Fable, emotion and psychology merge in a fairy-tale brew that will hold children rapt and engage the better angels of adults.
0.9 I feel like I need a second viewing for full absorption.
0.875 Ponyo isn't quite as memorable as some of Miyazaki's previous works, but it's a magical experience that's far superior to most animated offerings.
1.0 This poetic, visually breathtaking work by the greatest of all animators has such deep charm that adults and children will both be touched. It's wonderful and never even seems to try: It unfolds fantastically.
0.8 Admirable and enjoyable and beautiful, but it's a movie for the littlest of the little ones.
1.0 ...a sweetly lovable and visually trippy movie that young tots and their parents can enjoy in equal measure.
0.6 What held in the animator's previous films as eccentrically multifaceted dream logic comes off for once as a series of non sequiturs -- but really, why complain while sucking on an Everlasting Gobstopper of eye candy?
0.8 Charming, amusing and firmly anchored in a child's point of view, this movie from the master animator of Spirited Away makes a great introduction to that acquired-taste style of filmmaking.
0.6 See this film if you're looking to immerse yourself in a sense of delight over the simple wonders of a child's world.
0.8 With a starry, first-rate voice cast and the shortened name, this Disney-fied version remains a magnificent animation wonder and a pure delight.
0.625 Until its fizzle of a finale, Ponyo, Hayao Miyazaki's latest artisanally-crafted anime daydream, brims forth with an appealingly willy-nilly inventiveness pitched to a child's sense of wonder.
0.375 Not much in the way of laughs or anything else.
0.6 Some moments as lovely as the smell of cookies, especially the dance number.
0.6 Travolta magic is sprinkled everywhere
0.4 A cloying and cloudy romantic comedy in which Travolta dons angelic wings. Michael is innocuously whimsical but wasteful
0.4 John Travolta's Ever-Sap - Coming Soon to a Supermarket Near You
0.375 Fatally earthbound.
0.6 Kids will enjoy it, even if the jokes escape them.
0.6 All things considered, I got more fun out of the much maligned earlier attempt of bringing characters from the show to film, Boris and Natasha.
0.75 Expected punny dialogue and sight gags ensue, but also packed in are pointed, self-deprecating barbs about Hollywood, moviemaking, and the conventions of cartoons themselves.
0.75 These complaints are mere trifles compared to the fun I had at seeing my favorite moose and squirrel again.
0.6 If you liked the 1960s cartoon series upon which this film is based, you'll like this film.
0.2 There's just not enough depth of thought to sustain it onscreen for 90 minutes.
0.2 All of this adds up to a story we don't care about with nothing particularly involving and about two laughs both in the first ten minutes.
0.5 For the most part, the film succeeds, with predictable complaints stemming from the stretch marks that plague all features based on TV/animated shows.
0.75 The rare adaptation that celebrates the spirit of the TV show that spawned it instead of disgracing it.
0.2 So unrelentingly bad on so many levels.
0.3 It's sledgehammer whimsy, and it's not talking to me.
0.6 The picture, though loose and lazy for much of its life, does at least have a high degree of innocence, charm and pep.
0.625 a generally a fun movie, especially for those who are familiar with the old cartoons
0.4 Too fragmented to either please or sufficiently entertain any of its target audiences.
0.68 If the shrill know-it-all squirrel and his oafish horned buddy aren't old friends, then you'll likely want to give this a miss.
0.4 When it connects, the belly laughs are long and loud, but when it misses, the groans you'll be hearing are your own.
0.4 Falls flat within today's comedic standards.
0.5 McAnuff and screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan seem unable to get the story and the satire to co-exist.
0.25 Looms as the Howard the Duck for the new millennium.
0.5 After a surprisingly savvy and funny introduction, this wildlife road comedy can't generate enough smart-ass creativity to sustain its feature length.
0.75 The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle appears to be one of the frontrunners for both the 'eye candy' crowd and children's audience.
0.6 Rocky and Bullwinkle is too hectic to allow any breathing room for characterization.
0.75 McAnuff and his cast have a jolly time with this material.
0.625 A fun but rather ordinary cartoon crossover dressed up with the wit of Ward's creations.
0.7 The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is completely in the spirit of its progenitor.
0.5 It's a mostly adorable comic-adventure fantasy brightened by flashes of true inspiration.
0.625 Captures the tone and spirit of the original.
0.6 It is so unpretentious that it is impossible to dislike.
0.9 By making us conspirators in the humor, by constantly breaking the fourth wall ... to remind us that this is a movie about a movie about a kids' cartoon TV series, Rocky and Bullwinkle surprises and delights.
0.75 A sweet treat for the family audience.
0.625 90 minutes is too long for any incarnation of The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.
0.5 Rocky and Bullwinkle's latest adventure is a fractured tale.
0.2 Made by people who clearly think themselves much smarter than their audience. In place of whimsy, it offers cynicism.
0.625 Pity the poor toons stuck with such two-dimensional, (so-called) live-action figures.
0.75 There's a word for this movie, and that word is: jolly.
0.4 Goofy enough to be enjoyed on its own merits, but the "MST3k" version is pure gold.
0.6 Art Carney and Bea Arthur versus Darth Vader? This galaxy isn't far, far away enough!
0.5 As far as dystopian young-adult fare goes, 'Insurgent' is average.
0.75 Fresh characters include antipodal substitute mother figures for the newly orphaned Tris -- namely, a huggable agragrian played by Octavia Spencer and a skinny schemer played by Naomi Watts.
0.4 There's not a single frame "wrong" with the movie... but there also isn't anything in the whole of that's even fleetingly entertaining.
0.25 Miraculously, Woodley escapes from this gargantuan slog unscathed, a feat more exciting than any of the travails of Tris Prior.
0.4 Large interior scenes seem designed, propped and photographed less like dystopian drama and more like a Broadway musical---I halfway expected someone to break into a song called "Beyond the Wall."
0.375 Dauntless, Divergent, Erudite, Abnegation, Factionless, Candor. May I add the audience faction, Ennui? If ever a screenplay felt bludgeoned lifeless by a thesaurus, this is it.
0.4 The real problem here lies with the underwritten supporting characters and overabundance of repetitive action sequences.
0.875 After the tepid snore that was the last "Hunger Games" installment, "Insurgent" is muscular, brisk and imaginative - albeit on an emotive teenage level.
0.6 Schwentke cranks up the action enough to keep us distracted, with well-oiled scenes of renegades jumping freight trains, and simulated cliffhangers involving flying fiery buildings offering several edge-of-your-seat moments.
0.5 Insurgent is far too long for the minimal plot it encapsulates, features little in the way of meaningful character development, and is riddled with instances of poorly conceived, contrived developments.
0.4 For a film about standing out, this adaptation of a young adult novel fits its mold too predictably.
0.5 The two-hour effort could benefit from less moping, less violence and especially less fitful dreaming.
0.5 Tris and Four never grow as characters, while Winslet's Jeanine continues to register less as a formidable movie villain and more like that strict teacher you had in 10th grade who always assigned too much homework.
0.5 An angst-riddled, fast-paced sequel - a "Hunger Games" wannabe...
0.5 The action sequences have been ramped up and Insurgent smartly diverges from the book but it's still such a confusing and uninvolving storyline this YA adaptation made me HUNGER for something more. Thank God for Shailene Woodley though.
0.4 still suffers from the same dumbed-down science fiction storytelling and teen angst reliance that we saw in the first film
0.2 It's all a bit of an unengaging muddle, covered over with concrete grunge, clean white labs, and stagy special effects.
0.56 You won't feel like you wasted your money, but you'll probably think of something better you could have spent it on. Like a "Hunger Games" book.
0.4 Put it this way: At the end of this movie, not one significant character is frozen in carbonite.
0.46 The visuals didn't feel realistic enough to engage and overall "Insurgent" is a let down. Unless you're a hard core fan of the novels upon which it's based, I'd wait for cable.
0.3 Another nonsensical young adult film that makes me root for the evil dystopian society against the plucky heroine.
0.6 Insurgent falls short of hitting the bar set by superior YA film adaptations but is a step in the right direction for the Divergent series.
0.6 Insurgent is better than its predecessor and really, for a mildly entertaining action film, Insurgent could have been much worse.
0.5 The dialogue is clunky, and other than Tris the characters are one-dimensional. Moreover, it's all so earnest.
0.4 As a distillation of all that's most ordinary about contemporary young adult science fiction, it could hardly be bettered.
0.4 It was always going to be hard to match the fire-power of The Hunger Games series, but the gap is now huge. If Mockingjay Part 1 resembles a playful, sharp-toothed canine, Insurgent is more like a slug.
0.625 It's often painful to watch accomplished actors struggle through this material, knowing plainly that they are all here because of the financial opportunities this movie provided, rather than its artistic ones.
0.875 As the character embraces her new built-for-action pixie haircut (a holdover from Woodley's role as cancer patient Hazel in "The Fault in Our Stars"), Tris comes into her own as a hero who's both dynamic and sensitive.
0.6 Dystopian sequel ups romance factor; still very violent.
0.4 Ironically teens aren't playing post apocalyptic teen angst trauma characters in this teen angst trauma post apocalyptic, pathetic, practically pointless movie.
0.5 Insurgent stubbornly fails to surge.
0.5 It's better than the first one, but I thought the first one kinda stunk, so don't take that statement as too much of a compliment.
0.5 Most of the best stuff is saved for Insurgent's last half-hour, in which the movie goes "lysergic," as on an acid trip.
0.6 Much like the last film, the dialogue and the action suffer from a keen sense of lifelessness.
0.625 Unlike Divergent, which required pages of premise-establishing exposition, Insurgent is more purely action-centric, as the hunters hunt and the hunted flee through the trees, hopping freight trains, trying to elude capture.
0.5 Thankfully there's a lot more action in the latest instalment of the Divergent saga, which is great news because it means fewer slow spots during which you can mull over all the holes in both the story and concept of this hyped up teens-vs-adults dross.
0.625 Compelling in spite of its commonplace premise and themes. Wanting to see where Tris goes from here&#151;and how Shailene Woodley will continue to imbue her with life&#151;is more than enough incentive to keep watching.
0.5 [L]et's be clear: This is only slightly better than the last movie, with 'slightly' being the key.
0.4 Fans of the source material may still be eager for the next chapter but for casual viewers this is a disappointingly bland sequel.
0.6 The first Divergent instalment proved a bit dull whereas this one is enlivened by some first-rate special effects.
0.375 This second installment, based on Veronica Roth's series of YA novels, feels cobbled together and less focused than 2014's Divergent, and lacks tension and excitement.
0.4 When the drama boils down to a duel between Jeanine and Tris, there's a spark. Otherwise, it's a plodding letdown.
0.6 It least Insurgent has very lively performances from Woodley as the action heroine, James as her square-jawed beau, Ansel Elgort as her detached brother Caleb and Miles Teller (from Whiplash) as the Iago-like Peter.
0.5 It's impressive how the likes of Winslet, Spencer and Watts can spout their required gobbledygook and still maintain conviction.
0.625 Insurgent has more action than last year's debut film, which was modestly titled just Divergent. Action is what you want in a picture such as this, especially when you don't really have a lot on your mind.
0.625 It's a sequel that sticks to more routine territory of action, angst, and dystopian gloom - mostly a sound approach, thanks to the consistent strength of franchise lead Shailene Woodley and a mix of intended and inadvertent surprises.
0.375 There's suspension of disbelief and then there's what the Divergent movies require, which is a total rejection of the most basic concepts of humanity.
0.625 Woodley tries to emote a lot with her expressive eyes, but overall the film feels cold. Schwentke struggles to decide if "Insurgent" is more action or more YA and winds up doing neither genre much justice.
0.4 Maybe you had to read the book?
0.4 less interesting than exasperating
0.6 The first film was impossible to take seriously and that is still the case for the sequel. But it's less of a chore.
0.625 Watch out Katniss, your competition is hard as nails.
0.6 A dystopian drama that salutes the heroism and compassion of a gifted young woman.
0.54 The performances are fine. Everyone is solid, though they're not asked to do too much.
0.5 A trio of screenwriters (Brian Duffield, Akiva Goldsman and Mark Bomback) whisks us from one event to the next without providing the necessary details to support actions.
0.875 Smart, Slick and Superior to its predecessor.
0.5 It speeds past intricate intrigues and sketchy characterizations, moving like a sleek roller-coaster ride, free from clunky exposition.
0.625 Along the way, Tris has repeated nightmares about events from the last film she'd rather forget. I know how she feels.
0.6 Luckily for "Insurgent," Shailene Woodley is on board for the duration.
0.0 Were it not for the five lines of recognizably human dialogue spoken by Miles Teller, this whole thing would implode into a black hole.
0.625 Although Woodley is adequate at emoting - Tris being something of a basket case of guilt, self-loathing and teenage hormones - many of the other characters here are, by definition, one-dimensional.
0.5 "Insurgent" would be a much worse movie if the good parts were all at the beginning. But they are saved for the end, and they leave the viewer with a feeling of, "Well, that was OK," even though most of it wasn't.
0.75 If you've seen "Divergent," this builds on it nicely.
0.5 Fans of the first will love it. All others need not apply.
0.5 Even if you're curious about it, the movie is often plodding and frequently nonsensical, with action that never feels novel or exciting.
0.2 It delves even deeper into the poorly considered mythology, building action beats and moments of tension around a conceit that puts easy allegory ahead of logic or coherence.
0.4 Insurgent does get a few things right along the way, [but] they're completely overshadowed by the general dullness of the rest of the movie.
0.7 A sharp improvement on the original, this second entry in The Divergent Series has a much stronger sense of its premise and characters...
0.5 "Will someone please tell me what's going on?" Tris cries at one point, and she could be speaking for the audience as the plot becomes ever more muddled.
0.625 The cast still shines, but this mid-franchise movie is mostly spinning its wheels.
0.4 It scooped up the right star and it knows it; the film treats Woodley like a get-out-of-jail-free card for all its transgressions and fits of crappiness.
0.625 Woodley herself almost singlehandedly saves these films from being just another overwrought dystopian nightmare.
0.75 Puts the urgent in Insurgent.
0.5 Jumps headfirst into the mythology of the franchise, so that the only way to have fun is to become truly invested. Which would be fine if the story were intriguing enough to bother.
0.5 Insurgent is often more exciting and more eye-catching than its predecessor. Too bad its characters aren't any more interesting.
0.7 Insurgent succeeds because it doesn't bother explaining a darn thing.
0.5 A Little Golden Book version of drastically simplified socialism accompanied with a healthy dose of warmongering bravado.
0.625 The actors are more or less saving this franchise's bacon.
0.5 Of the featured cast, only Woodley really achieves any lasting impact in this episode, although the ham-fisted writing sometimes leaves her a little too exposed.
0.25 Practically everyone you're watching seems to be wishing they were somewhere else. So you might want to take the hint.
0.4 There's also not much in the way of lightness or humour in these kinds of films.
0.375 Long and violent but lacking narrative momentum, Insurgent is an inferior sequel to the already mediocre Divergent.
0.875 While I enjoyed the first Divergent movie, I did find Insurgent to be a better cinematic romp.
0.5 Trainloads of action abound (literally), but it's essentially generic combat. Punch, point, shoot, kill, get out of the way in the nick of time depending on your billing in the closing credits.
0.625 While the ending is meant to build up anticipation for the inevitable parts three and four, it plays as mostly resolved; you don't walk out of the theater thinking, I can't wait til the next one.
0.3 The only uprising that the regressive, repetitive and recycled Insurgent could ever incite might be in its viewers, rising up out of their seats and making a beeline for the theater doors.
0.75 That's a lot of back story to wade through and at times the expository world-building weighs heavy here too. But in "Insurgent," twists and developments bulk up the story and help further define the characters.
0.35 School is out forever in the Divergent series. And honestly, after all that set up, I don't know that this world is worth saving.
0.2 Woodley, great in "The Spectacular Now" and "The Fault in Our Stars," is a humdrum action star. Her amiable yet laid-back style turns the film's key moments from do-or-die into OK-whatever.
0.4 The plot makes zero sense and Shailene Woodley's on-screen chemistry with scowling hunk Four (Theo James) is non-existent.
0.6 The second chapter of the Divergent series is moderately engaging, but it's clear the impact of the franchise is inevitably deteriorating.
0.5 The finale, at least, gives one hope that this series will finally diverge from its YA "Hunger Games" formula in the next film.
0.4 Maybe that's why signing up for this sound-a-like saga was secretly a smart move [for Woodley]. When you're watching Insurgent, trying to quell the boredom, all you can think about is how much better Shailene is than the movie around her.
0.6 Once you swallow the giant pill that is the premise, it just about makes sense, and Woodley sells it with all her conviction.
0.4 Those who found Divergent one young adult dystopia too far will find little in Robert Schwentke's sequel to lessen bewilderment.
0.75 A rising young star exhibits an impressive acting range in a physically as well as emotionally-demanding role promising to do for her what The Hunger Games did for Jennifer Lawrence.
0.4 Teenage kicks are in short supply in the preposterous second instalment of Veronica Roth's derivative Young Adult series.
0.6 It's getting hard to feel empathetic for people who live in future dystopian societies. Oh, boo hoo, your peaceful government collapsed and ... you are grouped by how handy you happen to be at some particular task. You know, we all have problems.
0.4 "I know this doesn't make any sense," breathes Tris Prior during Insurgent's flamboyantly muddled finale, "but you have to trust me." You could hardly ask for a more honest line of dialogue than that.
0.4 Despite its earnest tone and unremittingly solemn performances, the entire movie feels like a simulation, devoid of lifelike detail or tangible dramatic stakes.
0.4 This second Divergent entry is a more propulsive and action-centric outing, but it turns star Shailene Woodley into a passive observer in her own adventure.
0.4 Middle films in movie franchises run the risk of being devoid of closure and linearity, and it's that inconclusive nature to Robert Schwentke's Insurgent that proves to be its greatest misgiving.
0.875 Jekyll's tragedy in this unique Stevenson revamp is that he doesn't understand that much of humanity already lives a Jekyll-and-Hyde existence -- including his unfaithful bride, who is a 'perfect wife' by day and a 'perfect mistress' by night.
0.7 One need not be a Cameron acolyte to recognise that The Abyss has aged better than some of the films that outshone it back in the day.
0.625 What ultimately saves the film are its extraordinary sets and phenomenal Oscar-winning visual effects.
0.5 The attempt to extract the essences of several genres (cold-war submarine thriller, love story, Disney fantasy, pseudomystical SF in the Spielberg mode) and mix them together ultimately leads to giddy incoherence.
0.8 Great blending of spectacle and drama.
1.0 Forget Titanic this is Cameron's best underwater flick
1.0 What was once a well-made, well-acted mess is now a very poignant and satisfying sci-fi adventure.
1.0 A gorgeous and fascinating underwater adventure.
0.6 A remarkable film...the vfx are super!
0.8 For God's sake, make sure you have the director's cut. The theatrical cut was an abomination.
1.0 Brilliant at sustaining tension and interest.
0.6 Suffers due to its incredible length and slow pace, but intriguing, nonetheless.
0.8 A classic.
0.8 ...the undersea adventure may have you waterlogged after the first hour.
0.8 The film lasts for more than two hours, yet the audience could hardly expect to be bored.
1.0 a rare film--big-budget Hollywood entertainment on a grand scale that is able to seamlessly incorporate many levels of meaning into an entertaining experience.
0.8 One of the best science fiction film ever made. This remains true in spite of a rather superficial treatment of the some of the science fiction elements. It is very much a 2001 with the slowish parts replaced by a good fast-paced adventure film.
0.9 A finely crafted film.
0.625 If the 1989 cut is a thrill ride, then the 1993 revamp is a frequently wrenching emotional roller coaster.
0.2 For those still in possession of their wits, this film is not only the worst of the Twilight flicks so far, but just about the most melodramatic and insipid movie I've ever watched.
0.375 The worst film in the "saga." Utter camp.
0.25 These movies have become one big joke, with hokey acting, slapdash visuals and Kindergarten dialogue. It felt like such a parody that it might as well have been directed by those jerks who made DISASTER MOVIE and EPIC MOVIE.
0.4 Breaking Dawn - Part 1 transfers pivotal events from the source material to the screen but fails to translate those events into a competent two-hour movie experience.
0.375 This film was made for the fans as they're going to be the only ones able to appreciate it, despite it not having any redeeming qualities whatsoever.
0.6 As a movie, this isn't terrible; none of them have been, really. Each film has gotten a director who has tried to do something simple and honest with Meyer's tormented material.
0.5 If I can say anything for the film, it's that it delivers exactly what the legions of Twi-hards want and expect--or what 'Team Edward' wants, anyway.
0.4 Terribly broken.
0.5 Bill Condon gives the series' fans what they have shown they want: uneven storytelling, maudlin dialog and decidedly one-note performances.
0.5 Whatever momentum the third film had in this series, it's gone. Once again, it's an average soap opera.
0.4 For a movie about life-sucking vampires and flesh-ripping werewolves, there sure is an inordinate focus on the birds and the bees.
0.4 Director Bill Condon, prostituting himself, flirts with teen porn ...
0.5 At least Jacob seems to understand the contradiction inherent in the insistence that coldblooded undeath is just another lifestyle choice.
0.5 drags along too slowly to give it much impact and instead engenders little more than impatience
0.75 Dawnfinally gives viewers something to sink their teeth into.
0.2 Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg continues her long tradition of scripting staggeringly banal, subtext-free dialogue and grasping at the profundity of her betters by quoting poetry in the prologues.
0.1 Twilight series dims - non fans stay away
0.45 Almost sort of liked it.
0.375 Tedious and toothless and feels at numerous moments more like a Saturday Night Live spoof that a proper continuation of the series.&#8233;
0.2 Bella e a candidata ideal a uma arrasadora depressao pos-parto. Mas com um marido sexualmente ambiguo e um melhor amigo pedofilo, quem nao seria?
0.5 There's less cringeworthy dialogue and Condon does a better job visually telling the story, but it's hard to make a riveting two-hour film when the main conflict seems completely arbitrary.
0.5 Condon can only do so much with the material at hand -- especially in this case, where maybe an hour of plot is stretched out to 117 minutes.
0.4 Breaking Dawn starts to confirm my theory that Twilight is just a tamer version of The Story of O.
0.636363636364 They have saved the best for last. This movie is totally romantic and its three leads are at their best. This will delight 'Twilight' fans and bring in new converts.
0.4 It's precisely three shots in that Taylor Lautner takes his shirt off, if that's your thing, and in all honesty I don't suppose that there can possibly be a more legitimate reason to see the movie.
0.5 Put a stake in this franchise.
0.6 Banal, bloodsipping installment to this far-fetched fantasy.
0.6 The storyline reached a new depth and is everything every fan will desire.
0.25 A wolf council with dubbed growls may be the most ludicrous scene of the year, but a rumble with chic vampires punching CGI werewolves comes close.
0.25 Suggested solely for Twilight diehards, this underwhelming, unfunny melodrama amounts to little more than an uneventful setup for next year's grand finale.
0.4 Yet another rather odd and protracted stepping stone to the ultimate finale ... it's a done deal for Meyer and co who are laughing all the way to the bank.
0.3 The occasionally amusing Twilight Saga finds a new low with the dramatically inert, painfully dull Breaking Dawn Part 1.
0.75 The most engaging Twilight movie yet.
0.4 A boring mess that exists only to milk the fans that made the series a success, but is so unsexy and just plain weird that even the most devoted Twihards stand to be disappointed or grossed out, or possibly, both.
0.6 Color us stoked that a Twilight movie even strays into evil-fetus territory.
0.6 In director Bill Condon's skilled hands, this instalment proves more intimate, confining its action to kids in rooms wrestling with the consequences of their own crushes.
0.75 ...as far as shameless cash-grabs go, Breaking Dawn: Part 1 is far easier to stomach than certain other franchise-extending installments (eg the Star Wars prequels).
0.2 th diarkeia ths tainias apoteloyn paratetamena solarismata dianohtikhs kathysterhshs, kai paratetamena solarismata egkefalikhs dyskoiliothtas
0.4 If you're on neither Team Edward nor Team Jacob, however, nothing in 'Breaking Dawn' will win you over.
0.2 The action sequences are ludicrous, the werewolves mostly just bounding, then bounding again, while the vampire trick of just moving ever so fast soon becomes just ever so tiresome.
0.6 I do wonder if seeing Bella turn into a near anorexic with a face that's bordering on Gollum might have subliminal implications for some vulnerable teenage girls.
0.6 Darker, sexier, sharper - a neat next step.
0.4 Let's hope they can wrap everything up with a better film than this one.
0.625 Critiques really have no weight when it comes to films like this. The haters are gonna hate, the fans are gonna love, and everyone else will check the movie listings and their own wallets before deciding if this is the best option for a night on the town.
0.75 The fourth book is so expansive that the filmmakers made the right call in splitting it into two parts. Stewart, Pattinson & Lautner have come to be genuine embodiments of the three major characters. The pacing is spot on with a...
0.7 A surprisingly entertaining romp.
0.2 Breaking Dawn Part 1 is such a slow-moving, overstuffed chore of a movie, it is barely even worth calling a "bridging film." All you do is wait and wait and wait.
0.4 Throughout the series, Meyer's lurid take on teenage passion has shone through as one of the ugliest and most insidious messages ever sent to its target demographic.
0.2 Is this really what Twilight fans want? Two characters drooling over and on each other for half the movie and not much else?
0.4 The bloated franchise's worst film without question, the fourth "Twilight" popcorn flick is a futile exercise on the disappointment of anti-climactic waiting. It doesn't sparkle or shine. It flickers, and then disappointingly dies.
0.1 There's plenty of stupidity... from talking wolves and geisha-like vampire make-up to the most uncomfortable newborn baby moment this side of A Serbian Film.
0.5 It is very focused on the idea of Not Pissing Off The Fans By Getting It Wrong. As a relative outsider, I found that this mentality sucked all the life out of the film.
0.3 Honestly, you can sneak into the movie an hour-and-a-half in and not miss anything.
0.2 So party on Twi-hards, you have no apologies to make for your love of this pulpy, romantic saga; just don't take it personally when the rest of us decide to party elsewhere.
0.3 ...a bad film, a self-aware one, for sure, but a bad one none-the-less.
0.5 It all goes wrong just when it should go right.
0.5 Melodrama reigns in this supernatural soap opera, even though author Stephanie Meyer's tale takes a decided turn toward the weird and violent.
0.625 If there was ever a franchise that plays like a TV soap opera with a climatic ending that leaves the audience wanting more, it's this one. If you have seen the previous three films, then you go into 'Breaking Dawn - P1,' already hooked in from the start.
0.4 What becomes clear is that while the bisecting of J.K. Rowling's hefty tome was artistically defensible, here, there's no such creative imperative.
0.5 There really is no polishing a Twilight movie, which by design will have to be both silly and terribly boring.
0.2 This latest Twilight is a freakish hybrid: part medical horror, part cheesy Victoria's Secret catalogue shoot.
0.4 This is a well-made film, though sometimes unintentionally funny.
0.6 Sexy honeymoon, disturbing pregnancy dominate latest movie.
0.625 Here's hoping Breaking Dawn Part Two gives us more of what Part One provided in the final 30 minutes than what it forced viewers to endure to get there.
0.4 It's essentially one insufferably long pregnancy sequence sandwiched between a sweet wedding and gruesome birth
0.6 As much of an homage to old timey experimental shlock horror as broad blockbusters can get ... I recommend Twilight virgins see BD1 as a stand-alone work.
0.2 The tagline states, 'Forever is only the beginning ...' After viewing this lifeless pap for mere minutes, we realize that it's not a slogan at all. It's a warning.
0.3 The worst entry in the series thus far, Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a toothless vampire film which plays slave to its tween demographic.
0.5 Sappy melodramatics are constantly on full display, the performances are distractingly exaggerated and the dialogue is so ridiculously cheesy it could force Kraft to file for bankruptcy ... yet, for some odd reason, I was kind of entertained.
0.6 The finished product allows the audience to take it as as seriously as it takes itself and/or laugh at its inherently ridiculous retro romance. No matter which side you're on, you wind up winning.
0.5 [It] was supposed to be climactic. Instead, it's the most jumbled and tonally confused movie yet.
0.7 "TBD-1" is smartly directed by Bill Condon ("Gods and Monsters," "Dreamgirls") in a straight forward manner that keeps the film from bogging down in its last act.
0.25 This is the one where things start to get silly.
0.4 The climactic clash between vampires and werewolves is over in a brief flurry of fangs and fur. What little action there is, however, is so poorly staged by new director Bill Condon that you're actually relieved there isn't more.
0.25 One of the glummest, lifeless movies of the year, it is gray and bleak, even when the sun is shining.
0.375 [T]he movie resolves everything of any obvious importance by the end, so, again, what's the point of this story?
0.0 Appalling by pretty much every measure.
0.5 Stretches forty-five minutes of material to two hours in order to satisfy the ignorant two-parter conclusion.
0.4 At this point in the story, the characters can't simply be innocent in order for the plot to work - they have to be naive. Edward Cullen is 120 years old. He has no excuse for being naive.
0.25 Bella shifts from her intended stance of antiheroine to something close to antimatter in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1.
0.6 A stylistic addition to a series about an impossible romance, the power of family and the lengths people will go to in order to fight for what they believe in.
0.6 Shamelessly cheesy, drawn-out and over-the-top as it is, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 is big, bombastic popcorn entertainment that knows exactly what the fans want, and delivers it in epic style.
0.0 It's based on a series of truly idiotic novels which, whilst works of an evil marketing genius, are artistic pollutants. Try and avoid getting dragged along to this one.
0.6 Condon is directing Breaking Dawn -- Part 2. Let's hope he realises it is broken and that he does fix it.
0.5 What remains is the total conviction that the ludicrous scenes are dead serious and fiercely meaningful. The result is not quite a laugh a minute, but close.
0.25 The sexless, bloodless, padded and plodding Breaking Dawn, Part 1 is the worst Twilight movie to date.
0.6 Endearingly bizarre, and featuring the usual fan-service in the form of topless hotties running through forests - you just wish it was a slightly better movie, given the Hammer Horror promise of the pregnancy premise.
0.5 Director Bill Condon may have been hampered by the original material, but he does nothing to help it along.
0.625 In several scenes, characters play chess, but the film itself is as complex as "Chutes and Ladders," and just as suspenseful.
0.375 The Twilight Saga hasn't matured along with its heroine. In fact, the latest movie regresses a bit, delivering more filler, less feeling and crummier CGI than last year's Eclipse.
0.6 Breaking Dawn - Part 1 and the upcoming Part 2 were both directed by Dreamgirls' Bill Condon, who keeps the lunacy moving apace.
0.625 Of the four Twilight movies, Breaking Dawn -- Part I has the most going on and the most going for it.
0.4 After the enjoyable previous instalment, to my mind the best in the series, director Bill Condon's film is a step backwards in quality.
0.4 It's all drawn-out and flat (even more so than is typical for the franchise), delivered at a slow, plodding pace that seems designed solely to stretch things out to two hours.
0.75 Fangirls, you have nothing to be ashamed of.
0.7 A satisfying culmination of emotions that have been building in this supernatural fantasy saga as Bella the human and Edward the vampire marry and face a critical decision.
0.625 It's like "Roadhouse" for women. As irresistible as it is ridiculous.
0.5 It makes you wonder if splitting the book in two parts was such a good idea.
0.75 Will Condon's movie convert agnostics to Stephenie Meyer's Twilight cult?
0.6 Sexy, silly, scary and stupid, the movie's tonal balancing act amounts to an Evil Dead for tween romantics.
0.4 It breaks my heart to tell you that "Breaking Dawn" is broken.
0.5 The good news? Now that all of the tedious exposition has been gotten, glacially, out of the way, "Part II" will probably be terrific.
0.75 It's the most imaginative picture in the franchise, and I say that as a fan of the first picture, Catherine Hardwicke's Twilight, an irony-free adolescent romance that took the idea of teenage erotic fantasy seriously.
0.2 easily the worst of the mostly awful Twilight films
0.45 You can't blame a film based on a book for adhering to the book's idiotic storyline. You can, however, blame it for sucking as a movie.
0.5 Breaking Dawn - Part 1 as a whole feels stretched-out, as if the filmmakers realized belatedly that there wasn't enough material in the book to sustain two movies. (There isn't).
0.6 It's all a lot of fun. For some movies you don't need intelligence, you just need faith, gullibility and a state of happy surrender.
0.4 [An] oddly joyless affair centred on an 18-year-old girl voluntarily destroying herself from the inside out, this might work as a standalone horror piece with a stronger directorial hand. As a so-called epic love story, it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.
0.5 The worst part of these movies has always been the moments when those mumbly lovebirds find themselves in a meadow, gazing off into the distance as they dreamily part each other's hair. There's a lot of that sort of moony-eyed action in Breaking Dawn.
0.4 Sex and abortion are the main topics of this installment, which tips between dullness and total camp.
0.7 One is also grateful for the film's finale... which is genuinely brilliant. There, I said it.
0.375 The dialogue is, of course, ridiculous and the acting ranges from stiff to mopey. But moments that should be pulsating with tension are usually hilarious because the special effects are still just so distractingly cheesy.
0.5 The absurdity quotient of the movie begins high and rapidly escalates to bedlam.
0.25 Two things are certain: it is one of the worst movies of the year, and it is going to make an awful lot of money.
0.625 Hands its reigns over to Oscar-winning filmmaker Bill Condon and, not coincidentally, produces the franchise's sturdiest installment.
0.6 As a stand-alone movie it's a mixed bag. But it progresses the story of beloved characters with a reverence for the source material that will doubtlessly please Twi-hards, ushering in a finale that promises to be darker still.
0.375 Lautner, who lasts approximately 8 seconds before tearing off his shirt, suggests more than ever that the casting director mistakenly told him he would be playing a robot.
0.7 The latest and best of the movies about a girl, her vampire and their impossible, ridiculously appealing - yes, I surrendered - love story.
0.4 The acting's better than it's ever been, but with the best will in the world, this can't get past the fact that the story's demented.
0.375 Whenever certain actors take the lead and set the pace of the dialogue, time itself begins to crawl backward and the breaking dawn begins to feel like yesterday's breaking dawn, or last Tuesday's.
0.625 This one draws you close and keeps you there - and, for those of us who haven't read Stephenie Meyer's novel, delivers some surprising turns of plot.
0.6 Though director Bill Condon is new to the series, both he and returning screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg have an excellent grasp of their audience's desires, and are determined to meet them in good faith.
0.3 Pattinson again stands around looking pale and soulful, while Lautner gets to act more, which is maybe not such a good thing.
0.625 Kristen Stewart is really pretty good here, although like almost all actresses she believes pregnant women rub their baby bumps unceasingly.
0.5 "Breaking Dawn'' is the series in its fullest Victorian flower. But with Bill Condon directing, the pacing is all wrong. It's "Pride, Prejudice, and Zombies.''
0.6 As maddeningly uneven as it is, Breaking Dawn boasts some of the strongest moments yet in a largely lackluster franchise.
0.375 Really a half-film, and the boring half at that. Such is the nature of things dubbed "Part 1." It's a film about things that will inevitably happen, but don't until the next, more important part.
0.4 Fails to inject its few key scenes with any life thanks to a woeful script, poor direction and lacklustre performances, though fans of the franchise should be used to that by now.
0.2 A rather good original idea has dwindled into self-parody.
0.5 After all that foreplay, the new Twilight saga is a limp anti-climax.
0.75 The series is finding momentum as it nears its finale.
0.4 The picture sidesteps all opportunities to depict the novel's nuttiness... in an intriguing manner and sands down all the edges to leave us with yet another generic melodrama, in which not a single moment rings true.
0.4 The script is flat, cliched and repetitive ("You did this!" yells Jacob. "I love her!" pleads Edward) - which might not matter necessarily as it wasn't much better in the predecessors.
0.2 The wolves speak with bizarre half-human, half-canine voices that put me in mind of Scooby-Doo.
0.8 The Twilight films manage to cleverly blend melodrama with supernatural thrills, and while the film is not without its silly moments and cringeworthy dialogue it does deliver the drama and emotional highs we have come to expect.
0.2 The vampire drama of Twilight is all about the romantic agony of eternity, and this franchise feels like it's going on for ever.
0.375 An American rocket ship crashes on a Pacific island where the dinosaurs still roam.
0.625 It's as beautifully animated as its predecessor, but its mixed message is troubling: It begins by endorsing nonviolence, as Hiccup insists that friendship can be a more powerful motivator than force, but ends by bludgeoning the bad guys into submission.
0.8 With multi Oscar-nominated British cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall) advising, DreamWorks' visual work is stunning, but the story feels fragmented by the mixture of strange accents and additional sub-plots.
0.875 A command of genre creativity blended with human insight.
0.95 How to Train Your Dragon 2 isn't just a great sequel, a great animated spectacle, or a great example of successful franchise-expansion/world-building. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is flat-out great film, period
0.75 With writer-director Dean DeBlois back at the helm, the sequel feels like a solid continuation of the first movie.
0.75 Here and there, it's as if the mythology of Tolkien has been filtered through the imagery of Miyazaki.
1.0 Bigger and even richer than the terrific 2010 hit animation, this sequel is also quite possibly the best action-adventure movie of the year.
0.8 A triumph that soars far beyond a lazy re-tread of the original. It is altogether darker, richer and more complex.
1.0 Funny, big-hearted and - as you'd expect - a visual feast, this a family film in every sense and one to be lapped-up by both kids and grown-ups alike.
0.6 The characters in this movie are charmers. They've got me so well-trained, I'm even looking forward to HTTYD3.
0.8 It has a richness that's highly compelling, especially in the way it explores the complex relationship between man and beast.
0.8 The filmmakers borrow freely from Avatar, Sword In The Stone and even Brave but they bring enough vigour and imagination to their storytelling to get away with it.
0.8 The sequel doesn't attempt to take things in a completely new direction, choosing instead to expand its world and characters with great success.
0.8 This swooping and soaring sequel boasts big thrills, innovative set-pieces and a surprisingly radical political outlook.
0.8 Textures and gestures are brilliantly rendered, the body language saying more about the characters and their relationships than any words ...
0.8 Despite the unimaginative title, How To Train Your Dragon 2 arrives full of its predecessor's invention, wit and flair.
0.8 Bigger, braver and even more visually rewarding than the original, it's an ambitious attempt to extend the scope of its predecessor without sacrificing the charm, humour and excitement that made that so appealing.
0.6 Hats off to Dreamworks for offering some bold surprises in a respectable sequel filled with moments of humour and emotion among its ample noise and movement.
0.8 At times terrifying and too tough for tinies, this is nevertheless a triumphant sequel that puts its faith in Hiccup and Toothless to find a way through dark times for man and dragon.
0.6 his franchise has swiftly proven itself to be one that has heart to match its dazzling visuals - it exists in a world that feels tactile, for once the 3D isn't crushingly disappointing.
0.7 Not as fresh or funny as its 2010 predecessor but with a bang-up second half, much visual beauty and a surprising emotional resonance.
0.8 This isn't just a more soulful movie, it's a much more spectacular one too. At times, it makes it's glossy rivals look like they belong in the Dark Ages
0.8 It begs the question: Are animated studio such as Pixar and DreamWorks catering to a much more mature audience? Or are they pushing the hearts and minds of wee-ones into new, dark boundaries?
0.8 Game of What? This is our new desert island dragon-themed pop pick.
0.7 There's actually a point about 90 minutes in where things take a very dark turn, and I momentarily thought the movie was going to end on an incredible down note.
0.7 The swirl of storylines, plot twists and huge battles might prove a tad too intense for kids under 10, and even adults will have to pay close attention...Still, the film can't be faulted for its movement, humour or [its] sheer beauty.
0.6 An efficient and entertaining franchise sequel, but it restates how conventionally Americanised this property has become in comparison with the literary original ...
0.7 Those who made [this film] know the kids who adored the original have grown since the [first one] and they're trying mightily to grow with them. That counts for something in today's popular culture universe, even if they seem to be trying awfully hard.
0.2 Unable to settle on any one story idea in particular, writer-director Dean DeBlois throws in three or four, which intersect at odd moments, like cars at a busy intersection, refusing to give the right of way, so that no one ends up going anywhere fast.
0.5 The most distinctive thing about the series is its strictly rational handling of fantasy themes. The dragons themselves can be fearsome or adorable - but since they don't speak, they're treated for the most part as pieces of hardware or beasts of burden.
0.8 How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the most solid, light, and enjoyable fantasy film of the summer.
0.7 There's something uniquely appealing, especially to kids, about animals acting like animals.
0.7 One of the top handful of movies ever made by DreamWorks Animation, but pretty much across-the-board weaker than the original How to Train Your Dragon.
0.8 I'm so impressed I actually saw a movie where I plonked down the coin for 3D and felt like I hadn't been robbed.
0.875 Dragon 2 does what every sequel should do, but few even attempt - expand the horizons of its original.
0.8 A rarity because this sequel outdoes the original.
0.7 A visual stunner with aerial sequences that will take your breath away, and many of the dogfights (dragonfights?) have that Star Wars sizzle.
0.9 A great sequel feels fresh and familiar all at the same time, which is why 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is a great sequel.
0.9 Waging peace can be every bit as heroic and satisfying as waging war.
0.8 DeBlois thankfully remembers everything the two of them did right in the previous film.
1.0 With its stunning visuals, majestic score, compelling perspectives, its massive yet impressive sense of scope, and its breathtaking camera angles, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is undeniably phenomenal and the undisputed animated film of the summer.
0.6 It's entertaining and gorgeous, but disjointed, veering between wildly emotional scenes on both ends of the spectrum without much thought for how they should flow together.
0.75 The film isn't afraid to occasionally saunter over to the dark side. How dark? Let's just say there's a late-breaking development here that will result in some moviegoers tagging it as this film's Vader-flavored "I am your father" moment.
0.875 Every bit as endearing as the original, if not even more stirring, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is full of humor, loss, adventure and romance. In other words, it has the same themes, lovable characters and beautiful look that made the original a hit.
0.875 How refreshing it is to find a summer sequel that's not simply louder or wackier than its predecessor, but rather feels like an extension of its first film and all of its best qualities.
0.75 Although there are times when bits of the movie feel extraneous, the production as a whole comes across more like an organic extension of the original tale than something tacked on purely to score at the box office.
1.0 Epic, thrilling 3-D adventure sequel is outstanding.
0.6 In the bigger is better world of Hollywood sequels, How to Train Your Dragon 2 comes up short. It lacks the novelty of the original and tries too hard to be "about" something more than fun.
0.9 A bigger, and arguably better, sequel experience that features more dragons, larger scale action set pieces, as well as a poignant message on the challenges of growing up.
0.8 An inspired and inspiring piece of escapism, this one will get the kids cheering on their feet and the grown-ups blubbering in their seats.
1.0 How to Train Your Dragon 2 will be tough for your kids to watch, and some of it will require explaining and discussion -- which alone makes it mean and matter more than the majority of designed-to-be-forgotten animated films in theaters these days.
0.85 It's clear that [director Dean DeBlois] took inspiration from the first Star Wars trilogy - not a bad model for breathing new life, and yes, a bit of fire, into one of Hollywood's more nuanced animated franchises.
1.0 Not only does this second movie match the charm, wit, animation skill and intelligent storytelling of the original, I think it even exceeds it.
0.875 One of the most beautiful animated films ever made.
0.8 Witty, rousing, heartwarming, sensational-looking, and at times touching, uplifting and even moving---and proof that Hollywood's still making movies that virtually all ages can enjoy, appreciate and admire.
1.0 An adventure for the eyes, and one forged with great imagination.
0.8 Just like the first film, when it's done you want to run out and pick up your own dragon.
0.75 While delivering the epic goods, the How to Train Your Dragon franchise continues to keep its eye on helping kids become better people, and that's a cause worth fighting for.
0.85 Dreamworks sure knows HOW to make a sequel: just add more dragons!
0.625 Can we give it a rating of PG-10 or PG-11?
1.0 More than just teaching kids what to think about the world they're coming into, it's a rare film that encourages them to think for themselves.
0.625 This was not a sequel that anybody needed, outside of the accountants. And there's another already planned.
0.875 One of this year's true surprises, the superior animated sequel not only is infused with the same independent spirit and off-kilter aesthetic that enriched the original, it also deepens the first film's major themes.
0.95 Provides a grandiose feeling that you're watching something truly special.
0.7 It takes what worked the first time and expands upon it, offering bigger, darker, more mature ideas without diminishing the original film.
0.625 Nothing in this likable sequel flies quite so high as those aerial shots.
0.875 Young and old fans of the first movie will be lining up for the wit, for the inventiveness of the characters, for the breathtaking visuals - and just the sheer fun of it all.
0.75 "How to Train Your Dragon 2" succeeds because it builds on, but doesn't try to replicate, the magic of the first movie.
0.625 It's just a bummer that such a pretty package lacks any real substance.
0.9 Offering a dramatically darker story, this feature serves as an animated homage to 'The Empire Strikes Back.'
0.9 In a summer filled with engaging entertainments, this is one of the best.
0.875 This is far removed from the innocent simplicity of its predecessor; How to Train Your Dragon 2 sees this series growing up -- quickly and for the better.
0.875 Not since Toy Story has an animated movie managed to feel so fresh and vibrant with its second helping.
0.875 This may be the first and last time anyone says this, but if "How to Train Your Dragon 2" is this good, why stop at 3 and 4?
1.0 The impressive part is the storytelling confidence of writer/director Dean DeBlois. He has created a thoughtful tale as meaningful for grown-ups as it is pleasurable for its young primary audience.
0.75 Nearly as exuberant as the original, How to Train Your Dragon 2 nimbly avoids sequel-itis.
0.75 Taking its cues as much from Star Wars and Game of Thrones as from its own storybook narrative, How to Train Your Dragon 2 breathes fire into a franchise sequel.
0.7 Toothless is so vividly, viscerally animated, I worry a child will look askance at her own humble dog and peevishly wonder why Fluffernutter can't fly, or at the very least breathe fire.
0.8 More emotional, exhilarating and expansive than the original. DreamWorks finally has a franchise to match its ambition.
0.875 For once, we have an animated sequel free of the committee-job vibe so common at every animation house, no matter the track record.
0.75 Gruesome? A little. Scary? You bet. But that's exactly what makes the "Dragon" films so different, and so much better, than the average children's fare.
0.75 How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a sequel that will inevitably be compared with its predecessor, and while it doesn't reach the level of that original film, it still acts as a decent continuation of the story.
0.75 DeBlois, who also wrote the script, successfully juggles the multiple story lines, shifting allegiances and uncharted lands.
0.875 Dragon 2, like The Empire Strikes Back, takes sequels to a new level of imagination and innovation. It truly is a high-flying, depth-charging wonder to behold.
0.2 'Bigger' pretty much describes this sequel to the 2010 sleeper hit - as opposed to, say, 'different.'
0.75 For audiences who want a sweet story, they can't beat the first film of a boy finding his best friend. For those who are ready for the next stage, try this one about a boy becoming a man.
0.6 It's the unflinching edge that gives the film its unexpected depth.
0.8 The film's real emotional heart comes from its unabashed fanboy love of dragons.
0.8 Overall, a very worthy follow-up.
0.875 The unusual second chapter that hits new heights in almost every way.
0.625 By taking its time in the 4 years since the 1st movie, Dreamworks has mounted a superior 2nd installment, one that gives heretofore untapped personality to its characters and an extra shot of heart to the touching, age-old tale of a Viking and his dragon.
0.75 The animation simply rules. Elegant and detailed, the film soars and whooshes with the craft that all animated movies should have.
0.9 An impressive sequel that leaves us cheering for the noble ideal of animals and humans living together in peace and harmony.
0.8 Flying high among this summer's blockbusters - it's enchanting!
0.8 As a reviewer who greeted the first film with lukewarm praise the reaction is much different this time. It joins that short list of sequels that surpass their originals.
0.75 Offers some stunningly beautiful sequences and an engaging, if at times quite dark, story line.
0.5 The plot is unfocused and jumbled, borrowing elements from other fantasy movies without bringing them together into a cohesive whole.
0.6 As far as animated action-adventure outings go, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a solid and exciting offering for those to whom the franchise appeals.
0.75 "How to Train Your Dragon 2" doesn't play it safe, and that's why it's the rare sequel that doesn't feel somewhat stale.
0.95 How to Train Your Dragon 2 does what most sequels can't -- that is, it expands on the original while maintaining the core elements of what made the first film so great.
0.8 It seemed as if there was nowhere new to go after the first film, but this is a richer story that dares to go darker and is thus more rewarding.
0.625 OK, but the thin charms of the original are a little thinner this time out.
0.6 How to Train Your Dragon 2 is an exciting adventure with rousing animated action, but it lacks the emotional hook of its predecessor.
0.5 It has the core of a genuine crowd-pleaser, but unfortunately something bigger and more all-consuming keeps getting into its head.
0.6 Not all the heart-swelling flying sequences in the world can flap away the sensation of franchise fatigue here.
0.9 Heartfelt, funny, and captivating, this is a satisfying continuation of the first film.
0.9 You may experience that rare sense of wonder that comes from losing yourself in a proper, well told story.
0.8 DeBlois' powers haven't diminished ... he dares to go deeper, smarter and even darker, honing in on the elements that made the first film work.
0.6 When the film flies, it soars.
0.8 In a season of endless comic book superheroes, Hellboy II is a unique visual feast.
0.8 Hellboy II is fabulously imaginative, visually sumptuous and dramatically complex; what's more, it's very funny and engaging.
0.6 [The film] will delight fans of the original comic-book adaptation, offering up as it does a much bigger spectacle with more wit and an eye-popping gallery of exotic creatures, while leaving non-enthusiasts like me admiring but uninvolved.
0.8 Other than Christopher Nolan, is there another director as hot as Guillermo del Toro?
0.5 I'm just not interested in this film very much. I wish I was. But it's good to look at.
0.6 Hellboy II: The Golden Army has the technical brilliance of a Renaissance masterpiece and a brain the size of a pea.
0.6 It's not that Hellboy II is a particularly bad sequel, but that it tries to do way too much in the time allotted.
0.625 The action's pretty pedestrian, and you wouldn't be blamed if you wished they'd just get it over with so that we could get back to the glories of Hellboy himself.
1.0 I was a fan of the first film about this unlikely hero, a big red guy with horns, a tail and a liking for sweets, kittens and cigars. And the good news is the sequel is even better.
0.7 Behind a truckload of red makeup is Ron Perlman, whose characterisation of the egocentric protagonist Hellboy, or Red as he prefers to be called, is once again the highlight of the film.
0.4 Del Toro is his generation's Terry Gilliam, an intensely visual director who loves his ideas so much that he's happy to disappear into them for minutes at a time, forgetting all about such trivial concerns as story, characters and audience.
0.6 Hellboy is enjoyable because, unlike the rest of the heroes in this long summer of the superpowered, he's not dragged down by character neuroses.
0.6 Hellboy II is one of those films that you want to love.
0.75 Hellboy II: The Golden Army zips from tense showdown to eerie spectacle at particle-accelerator speed.
0.8 Guillermo del Toro's mastery of fantasy film-making and his understanding of the multi-faceted richness of the genre guides this sequel to visually imaginative and intricately detailed heights.
0.75 For all its gorgeous freakishness, the movie is even more about love and friendship than the first one was.
0.8 It wouldn't be classic del Toro without the razzle-dazzle. The Golden Army provide that as they finally rise up, but even in the culminating moments of battle, it is del Toro's feel for human grace that shines through.
0.8 Style over substance, no doubt, but when you've got this much style who cares?
0.65 Hellboy II is still very entertaining, even if it is simultaneously a little lackluster, and fans of the original are sure to like it. It probably won't hold up well on repeat viewings though.
0.8 Impressiona pela escala e pela criatividade.
0.6 Some the magical images conjured here are absolutely unforgettable.
0.6 The sets are dazzling, but the characters (manufactured by computer artists in most cases) aren't particularly designed to engage.
0.7 Not only are the creatures amazingly conceived, but there's a lovely sense of humour to it all as Del Toro references horror movies of the past and even the work of John Landis.
0.8 The film is designed more as an ear-shattering sensory assault than a conventional narrative.
0.6 Hellboy is it's own world. That is a compliment and also the problem. Director Guillermo del Toro has envisioned a fantastic looking world, but it's just a vision.
0.6 All the same, this isn't a patch on the phantsamagoric splendour of Pan's Labyrinth, over-egging every set-piece and outstaying its welcome by at least half an hour.
0.8 Prepare for some devil worship. Hellboy is the hottest, strangest and most fun comic book hero around.
0.8 Playful, offbeat and with a decidedly droll sense of humour, Hellboy II's a richly rewarding superhero film with moments of gleeful comedy that films like Get Smart can but dream of.
0.8 A devil of a good sequel.
0.7 Smart lighter touches such as Hellboy and Abe's crooning to a Manilow classic set this apart from other comic book adaptations and the stylish direction keeps your attention. Great fun.
0.8 A baby-step backwards after Pan's Labyrinth, but a rung up from the original Hellboy: more laid-back, even more out-there. Ignore the shaky plot and gorge on the grand design as del Toro lets his imagination - and some classic creatures - off the leash.
0.8 Second time around, director Guillermo Del Toro scores another direct hit with a monster yarn as keen on the gags as the global destruction.
0.8 Hellboy 2 is a movie that's a tingling boost to the senses: and that sense of humour is such a stimulus to the other five.
0.8 With Hellboy II, the comic-book blockbuster has finally grown up - without giving up the fairy-tale wonders of our youth.
0.6 Del Toro's imagination is as fertile as ever but the plot keeps too much in reserve.
0.8 Guillermo del Toro's Faberge egg of a fairytale is not so much a sequel as a fusion of the fabulist imagination of 'Pan's Labyrinth' with the witty, irreverent comic-book action of his own 'Hellboy'.
0.8 As much Tolkien's baby as Mignola's, this has more heart and humour than most fantasy films can dream of. Hellaciously good.
0.6 By Mike Martin - From the man who made Pan's Labyrinth it's a disappointment.
0.8 While the plot lends itself to pretentious blockbuster hysteria, del Toro keeps things grounded by focussing on the characters and their sardonic banter
0.8 ...moves with the virile grace of a prizefighter.
0.5 Del Toro seems to use this movie as batting practice for The Hobbit.
0.625 Hellboy II: The Golden Army is not a sequel that soars to new heights, but it does slip into a nice summer-movie comfort zone . . .
0.75 Further proof that franchises' second films can be better than the first. This one tops the original in a number of ways, not the least of which is its creative inventiveness.
0.75 Despite my complaints, this is one gargantuan action film that succeeds in creating an entertaining fantasy universe.
0.75 Is this fun? Hellboy, yeah!
0.75 Surprisingly rich entertainment, even takes on well known series: Star Wars, LOTR, & Die Hard; framed squarely within a sub-par opening and weak ending. Still, I liked it!
0.5 Hellboy II, like the recent Chronicles of Narnia sequel, sacrifices story and character on the altar of action, effects and underwhelming creatures.
0.875 Del Toro's compositions are dense with effects and background creatures, and he clearly sympathizes with the misfits and monsters who are weary of humankind's greed and ecological destructiveness; yet the movie is light on its feet and generous of spirit.
1.0 The film itself is lovely, a breathless feast of fantasy anchored by an authentic humanism.
0.8 The fact that the setup works for a second round can be attributed Perlman's ability to juggle brash enthusiasm with hardened sarcasm.
0.5 While this sequel to the 2004 feature doesn't lack for visual wonders, it's utterly clumsy in the storytelling department, a genuine shock given del Toro's usual ability to spin a tall tale.
0.9 Here's a comic-book movie with a heart, a soul, a brain and a personality of its own -- as personal in its own way as del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth.
0.7 A virtual overkill of bizarre creatures
0.625 Guillermo Del Toro's love for creature features comes through, but his story is uncomfortably rote in this visually dynamic comic book sequel.
0.75 Go to the movies long enough and you'll eventually find yourself rooting for a blood red, horned monster-man from hell.
0.8 An essentially unending parade of some of the most visionary images ever to grace a fantasy movie.
0.7 Hellboy II's expansive imagination so elevates the material that you find yourself wishing it was put to the service of something greater.
0.875 Guillermo del Toro makes this sequel fully his own, firmly planting it in his unbridled imagination.
0.9 Gains big points for its dazzling visuals and for significantly ramping up the fantasy-tinged screen fighting.
0.6 The disappointing storyline is geektacular nonsense.
0.6 The visuals of HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY are a triumph of imagination, but the story is more of a failure.
0.75 ... an improved sequel over the original film, able to build upon the foundation of the first feature and finally put Hellboy in real mortal danger...
0.9 You've got enough ideas for an entire geek-friendly trilogy in this one crazy movie.
0.75 Without question, del Toro's a visionary who lets his imagination run wild.
1.0 Awkward as the plotting is, the movie is too stubbornly weird, too deeply in love with freakishness, to be waved off.
0.25 About a half hour into Hellboy II: The Golden Army, my friend turned to me and asked "Does this movie have a point?"
0.8 Del Toro's imagination cuts loose with a sharp, witty script. Hellboy 2 is the fun, fantastic comic book blast that the original film never quite lived up to. I'll be looking forward to "Hellboy 3: Rise of the Little Red Babies" in a couple of year
0.8 Hellboy II: The Golden Army stretches beyond the first film in both creepiness and humor, making for kind of an odd mix that manages to work in the end.
0.875 Hellboy II: The Golden Army hits just the right mixture of style, comedy, action, and character development. Here's hoping for a third installment.
0.625 One can't help but wonder whether Del Toro hasn't misjudged the balance between comedy and gravity in this sequel.
0.5 In Hellboy II, director Guillermo del Toro delivers the Hollywood filet mignon we've come to expect wrapped nicely in all the special-effects bacon we've come to desire but without the heart we've come to demand.
0.75 This movie is everything Hancock wanted to be, but failed to deliver.
0.75 There's so much beauty and imagination on display in Hellboy II: The Golden Army that it's sometimes hard to tell if you're watching an action movie or a museum exhibit called 'The Artistry of Guillermo Del Toro.'
0.75 The talented fantasy filmmaker and heir to the Lord of the Rings throne gets the tone right throughout Hellboy 2, and the hip retro charm alone is enough to merit recommendation.
0.875 It's an entertaining, visually stunning romp busy with fantastic ideas and well-rounded characters...
0.75 Combining animatronics, digital effects -- and most important, the director's fertile imagination -- Hellboy II gives us a taste of the magic del Toro is sure to bring to J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit.
0.75 A surprise package of fun, fright and untamed imagination.
0.75 The second film is more assured, better paced, and has a stronger emotional component.
0.875 A fabulously freaky and fun immersion into a world of skin, hair, teeth and bones that aren't our own. Revolving around the ideas of bedtime-story imagination and fatherly obligation, it's more exciting, elegant and confident than its predecessor.
0.75 Hellboy II, like its 2004 predecessor, has a middling story line, but it's made memorable by the dark, freaky visions of director Guillermo del Toro. And this time, his imagination runs wilder than ever.
0.625 Guillermo del Toro's more extravagant, $75 million follow-up to his 2004 B-movie doesn't take any of this particularly seriously. It's a monster movie in which the monsters listen to Barry Manilow.
0.8 The inventive del Toro creates visual fantasies unlike any other, and the creatures on display here are truly extraordinary. But amid all the costumes, all the action, and all the special effects, it's the humanity that makes his work so memorable.
0.875 It's the biggest, richest, most imaginative superhero movie of the summer.
0.625 Hellboy II has the inclinations of a gas guzzler but the soul of a hybrid, and the two resist each other like partners in a loveless marriage.
0.875 It's the path del Toro takes to get there that gives the film its propulsive kick: You literally never know what's coming next, and what does is always better and cooler than you could have imagined.
0.75 The summer's been loaded with superhero movies, some better and some worse than Hellboy II, but none is as exuberantly creative, nor as unconventionally committed to being so many things other than a live-action comic book.
0.6 On this latest Boy Meets Ghoul: Hellboy II's look is red hot. But it lingers too long on the fire, its promising sizzle ultimately losing flavor.
0.625 Enjoy The Golden Army for what it is, a big fat piece of eye candy. But for the next Hellboy movie could we please have a lot more Hellboy?
0.7 Hellboy II: The Golden Army may not be a masterpiece -- del Toro is capable of much more -- but it is whip-smart, pain-stakingly crafted and exuberant.
0.75 Melds the original Hellboy's kibitzy humor and crushing action with Labyrinth's darkest fairy-tale imaginings.
0.625 Hellboy, a sensitive devil with a tough exterior, is an inspired creation but limited as a dramatic protagonist. When you start with a demon hero, you can't settle for making his adversary a less complex demon.
0.75 Hellboy II: The Golden Army is one of the coolest-looking movies, if not the most visually impressive one, of the summer.
0.625 The PG-13 Hellboy is fun. And it's unafraid to embrace the schmaltzy.
0.625 Fanboys won't mind the absence of depth or emotion; they may even welcome it for making the film more representative of its comic-book origins. The rest of us, however, cannot rejoice at the overspending and overkill likely to come in Hellboy III.
0.75 A blast of fanboy wit, style, imagination, and prodigious noise that comes on like heavy-bore pop art.
0.625 Hellboy II is a creature feature unlike any you've seen before. But next time, let's try a little storytelling, too.
0.8 [W]hile it's nice of Mignola and Del Toro to create something like this out of whole cloth it's the eye candy, not the story, that people are going to talk about.
0.75 First and foremost, Hellboy II is a riot of creature and set design as well as big action set pieces. Yet Del Toro never reduces the characters to mere action figures.
0.7 As he loves Liz, life, and TV, Hellboy embodies possibility, faith, and imagination.
0.8 Like a young Spielberg before him, del Toro gives off this "I get to make movies for a living, isn't that awesome?!" vibe that's too often missing on the screen.
1.0 I left the theater nearly delirious from what I had just experienced--and I can't wait to take it all in again.
0.8 del Toro has made an astounding bit of eye candy but viewers going in hoping for another emotional masterpiece on the level of "Pan's Labyrinth" may come away from it slightly disappointed.
0.75 ...easily one of the most imaginative films of the summer.
1.0 This is big screen fantasy as a wish fulfillment free for all, a far out fairytale told in the most intricate of celluloid calligraphy.
0.7 Hellboy II is downright goofy. When it's not being funny, the creatures steal the show.
0.8 Hellboy 2 is visually perfect and is a sentimental look into the world of Hellboy but keeping with the love story of the film it should have been called Heavenboy.
0.875 Del Toro seems to have been given more freedom and more money to create an even more complete universe, packed to the corners with his peculiar, unique ideas and nightmares.
0.8 Imagine one of the Star Trek crews transported to Tolkien's Middle Earth, or Buffy and her Scooby gang whisked away into the heart of Narnia.
0.8 Hellboy II takes the fantastic make-up artistry, creature creation, and set design that we grew fond of in Pan's Labyrinth and combines all of these elements with mindblowing CGI and stunning choreography
1.0 By far the most imaginative action movie in ages - a mix of epic fantasy, tender romance, broad comedy and double-barreled excitement that satisfies all your pleasure centers.
0.75 The wonders are, if not endless, then abundant. And in a movie landscape where "effects" too often supersedes "special," wonders are worth savoring.
0.625 If the premise isn't exactly air-tight and the pacing is uneven, the visual panache and central character work helps to make up for some of its deficiencies.
0.625 For all its eye-popping, Middle Earth-meets-Mos Eisley majesty -- its mix of Heironymus Bosch, Jules Verne and George Lucas -- Hellboy II is a letdown.
0.75 I can barely keep up with the mythology put forth by the Hellboy series, but I enjoyed the first film, and I enjoyed the new one.
0.7 A dark fantasy/horror tale, it's chaotic yet spectacular.
0.75 With director Guillermo del Toro's fantastical vision on overdrive tempered by an occasionally self-mocking sense of humor, this Hellboy sequel is a quintessential summer movie that delivers plenty of inventive thrills.
0.875 We should be glad that del Toro is operating at his peak right now, getting all the money and latitude he needs to weave his spells.
0.6 As big, mindlessly fantastical summer entertainment goes, this falls comfortably between Iron Man (the gold standard) and the not-quite Incredible Hulk. It's a visually striking, mildly amusing way to kill a couple of hours.
0.7 It's not perfect -- thank Satan! -- but Hellboy II: The Golden Army is by far the most splendidly imaginative and creatively uncorked piece of fantastic cinema since the director's Pan's Labyrinth netted an Oscar trifecta in 2007.
0.875 [del Toro] has an endlessly inventive imagination, and understands how legends work, why they entertain us and that they sometimes stand for something. For love, for example.
0.75 A visual treat in every way, "Hellboy II" delivers on all cylinders.
0.75 Director Guillermo del Toro is a mad genius, and I want to get drunk with him.
0.75 Cool monsters aside, it's really the humor and the characters make Hellboy 2 into something more than just another summer special effects flick.
1.0 A quirky, idiosyncratic, Harryhausen-inspired, art house creature feature with the poetry and narrative depth characteristic of misunderstood monster classics such as The Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Bride of Frankenstein.
0.8 Much more than a big-action, small-brain summer movie.
0.75 The line from special effects whiz Ray Harryhausen to director Guillermo del Toro has never been so clearly visible...
0.4 Simply a bull in a china shop, smashing around aimlessly, desperately hoping we'll at least be impressed with the horns.
0.75 ...isn't much of a story, yet as a vehicle for the monstrosity-minded imagination of writer-director Guillermo del Toro it offers an endless array of bizarre visual riches.
0.75 Visually stunning comic book sequel from the endlessly inventive Guillermo del Toro amounts to little more than a noisy mess. But it sure looks pretty along the way.
0.8 A film of richly complex themes overlaid with a frothy plot, each serving to disarm the audience while holding it rapt.
0.6 Will appeal to the freak inside you who refuses to follow orders and is not afraid to let your gentle side out every once in a while.
0.75 Adolescent pulp fantasia meets sentimental married life in Guillermo Del Toro's follow-up to his 2004 working-class superhero movie.
1.0 Clearly, del Toro has a deep affection for both his characters and the world of gods and fairy-tale monsters, and it translates into a rich, sophisticated sequel that actually improves on the original.
0.8 Inconceivable in any incarnation other than Ron Perlman whose size, head shape, bluster and irrepressible grumpiness endear him to us.
0.9 Hellboy II: The Golden Army is huge and filled wall to wall with more imagination than any other film this year.
0.8 Hellboy is without a doubt the most compelling and interesting superhero character ever on screen.
0.7 An imaginative if somewhat messy B-movie, the type for which popcorn is popped.
0.6 There's a peculiarity to Hellboy 2 that blurs the line between del Toro's Hollywood blockbusters and his less conventional Spanish-language films.
0.4 Despite a handful of creepy and visionary sequences, this sequel remains limp and unengaging.
0.85 Not just a vast improvement over its predecessor, but the quality on almost every level is almost night and day with a stronger story and some of the most mind-blowing creature and FX work we've seen this summer.
0.75 There are some remarkably beautiful things in Hellboy II... but suffers, in my opinion, from too much of everything.
0.8 I stumbled out of Hellboy II: The Golden Army feeling as if my imagination had eaten too much ... And yet, Hellboy II has more than a little heart to it; it's scrappy and self-aware, and never out of touch with what it is.
0.7 There was no way, shape or form that HELLBOY II would meet its expectation, but even with all of the anticipation, the film managed to entertain just enough... In the end, what you'll get is another fun, yet forgettable summer blockbuster.
0.85 Hellboy II feels like nothing less than the successor to Pan's Labyrinth... dressed in spandex.
0.75 The movie is seeped in distinctive visuals, lavish photography and set design that recalls the wondrous texture of "Harry Potter." What, then, held them back on taking further creative opportunities with the story?
0.75 This latest rendition of "Alice in Wonderland" is a journey worth taking mainly to see Tim Burton's imagination at play. The story is so well-known, but you haven't seen it done quite in this way before.
0.4 Time to take some of Lewis Carroll's advice, Tim: eat me.
0.7 It's the kind of movie that should inspire you to get a Blu-ray player and hi-def television if you don't have them already.
0.75 That Johnny Depp's take on the Mad Hatter is comparatively one of the more subdued performances tells you just how out there Tim Burton's film is.
0.2 Lewis Carroll is bent over a table, tears filling beneath his eyes. Something in your heart breaks. Your childhood, perhaps?
0.625 ...an endeavor that's big on spectacle yet small on plot...
0.6 Despite stunning visuals and fine performances Alice in Wonderland never really goes anywhere. Or rather it goes somewhere we've all been before.
0.6 Even though Burton is unable to channel much suspense or awe, the film is a sumptuous visual delight. It all adds up to a mildly enjoyable adventure, sadly lacking in ambition.
0.4 A bland adventure fantasy, Alice in Wonderland may be pretty to look at, yet offers nothing more than Tim Burton's now generic and uninspired brand of filmmaking.
0.3 The Alice books gained fame for being totally unconventional, and you decide to make a totally conventional movie out of them?
0.5 Could have been called Alice in Blunderland, Burton's latest is inferior to the childish Disney feature in nearly every way.
0.8 A fun film with awesome visual design. I think that over time detractors will mellow and Burton's Alice will become a classic. Bandersnatches and Futterwackens not withstanding.
0.375 For all its noise and distractions and CG decal, this Wonderland is a zone void of imagination; it proves how relatively mind-blowing Avatar's Pandora actually was.
0.6 Johnny Depp, basicamente dependendo apenas da maquiagem e de proteses, investe numa composicao caricata como o personagem exige ao mesmo tempo em que se apresenta em cena como uma especie de filhote assustado de Madonna, Gene Wilder e Elijah Wood.
0.5 Anne Hathaway is ridiculously miscast as a deliberately weird White Queen, although the character is supposed to represent Good against the Red Queen's evil.
0.5 Kids will enjoy the characters and the 3D. But grownups? Well, not this grownup, who is a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fan, and who expected more.
0.8 ...[Burton] made an Alice in Wonderland film that wasn't Alice in Wonderland. Kinda.
0.5 A head trip into blunderland.
0.375 Burton's personal stamp is missing. On Alice he is a director for hire, helping the Disney empire repurpose one of its animated properties and reinforce its 3-D bulkhead.
0.5 Vizualno atraktivan film prepun grotesknih likova i CGI-efekata o kojima se donedavno nije moglo sanjati
0.75 Alice in Wonderland is normally not my cup of tea, but I was happy I joined the tea party this time.
0.75 Alice in Wonderland lands in a comfortable zone that should accommodate both kids and adults.
0.4 La imaginacion visual de Tim Burton encuentra terreno fertil en los personajes de Lewis Carroll, pero el resultado luce poco original y sorpresivo. Quien se destaca es Helena Bonham Carter como la irritable Reina Roja.
0.2 What should have been an eye-popping and jaw-dropping dream combination of two celebrated fabulists is instead a dour and unpleasant disaster that reduces one of the great modern mythical tales into a ugly mess
0.5625 Tim Burton is the kind of director who probably does come up with six impossible things before breakfast. So it was a surprise to see him produce a film so lacking in joy, innovation and curiosity.
0.4 Alice In Wonderland may look fantastic, but there's little else going for it. It's emotionally cold, utterly predictable and there's never any sense of peril.
0.875 This may be the most fantastic, wondrous, and sinister realization of Alice's wonderland to date.
0.7 Burton treats the eyes and tickles the funny bone, no doubt, but the heart and mind are left wanting.
0.75 Burton manages to put his unique visual spin on the familiar elements of the story, although he never quite reaches the heights of Jefferson Airplane's immortal anthem "White Rabbit"
0.45 Quite tiresome in the end.
0.6 I found Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland to be a treasure trove full of delight and near-amazement. The imagery is bold and ravishing. Alice in Wonderland is surreal and smashing.
0.5 Carroll's whimsical fantasy is transformed... into a bombastic action movie with traces of J.R.R. Tolkien.
0.4 The fact remains -- Alice doesn't live here anymore.
0.75 It's something like a post-modern tale of self-discovery, although it works better as a nutty fantasy than as anything with a point.
0.8 Pese al flojo argumento, visualmente el filme es una fiesta, rescatando el oscuro estilo Burtoniano pero asaltado ahora por la rebeldia del color en una direccion de arte realmente preciosista. En este contexto, la realizacion brillantemente hace justicia
0.75 (Burton)is the perfect person to put in charge of translating the magical world that Carroll created to the big screen.
0.625 Alice, a wonder to behold, but cold.
0.4 Tim Burton's latest assault on the senses is partially redeemed by Johnny Depp's brilliant acting.
0.9 ...enormously entertaining...Depp gives a performance that must be seen to be appreciated. He shows here that he is something special.
0.9 I didn't find it to be the masterpiece I'd hoped for. It's good. It's very good -- and there are flashes of greatness within it.
0.4 Great visuals, but lacking in story.
0.4 If there was one adjective I could pick to describe this new adaptation, it would be "dispirited"
1.0 21st Century Alice matures and enters The Matrix!
0.625 The visual splendor is more than enough to feast your eyes on, so it's too bad that the dialogue in the film couldn't live up to its look.
0.3 Alice in Wonderland reminds me most of Sleepy Hollow: empty, faux-atmospheric, and without soul.
0.8 I appreciate Burton's love for the characters as he expresses it through such creative wizardry. But, then, I also have a wistful feeling over the lightness of its total affect. A delicious snack but not quite a full meal.
0.5 Alice in Wonderland is a lovely display of Tim Burton's amazing offbeat aesthetics which win me over every time, but sadly doesn't make for very much of a film.
0.5 The off-kiltered Tim Burton version of Alice in Wonderland might frightened younger children, confuse older ones and bore the adults.
1.0 These aren't actors working in front of blue screens with obvious effects dubbed in later. You really are in Wonderland. Real life and CGI are seamless.
0.6 Lower your expectations, because Tim Burton has created a great canvas, just not a great film.
0.7 ...a feast for the mind, if not necessarily the intellect
0.625 This Alice is more Ripley, or Lara Croft, than timeless story heroine.
0.625 If you're taking pulls from the Blue Caterpillar's hookah atop his magic mushroom, you care more about Hot Pockets than narrative integrity.
0.625 The movie's strengths are the costumes, the makeup, the production design, the special effects, the vocal work and a terrific musical score by Danny Elfman that has a quality of magic and wonderment missing from the screenplay.
0.6 The images rival anything Burton has created for 'Big Fish' and 'Edward Scissorhands,' but the storytelling isn't quite as engagingly odd.
0.75 Alice is a really good time, as well as a great example of how 3-D can be effectively used as a tool to immerse us in imaginary worlds.
0.3 a new story out of Carroll's mythmaking that fails to inspire interest, perhaps except as a rote exercise in mainstream weirdness.
0.4 ...the visuals are overwhelming, the direction to most of the cast seems to be to chew the scenery, and we're back to a movie being released in 3D for no discernible reason.
0.4 Rather than a Wonderland full of terrifying adventures and deliciously absurd whimsy, Burton has created the Underland, a place of terrifyingly, yet lugubrious, bad filmmaking. He dispensed with the whimsy altogether.
0.625 A visually stimulating rendition that nevertheless comes off as lamentably timid.
0.25 There is very little to praise in what amounts to Burton's most mercenary movie.
0.75 He [director Tim Burton] beat the odds and made this Alice a real wonder.
0.6 Every bit of havoc and nonesuch is put in service of the story of Alice's feminist awakening, and it's about as exciting as it sounds.
0.5 It's become a common argument against Burton, this lack of dramatic drive, but it's true in this instance.
0.7 The beguiling Wasikowska tethers the arcane anarchy with weight and emotional clarity, anchoring us as moviegoers to Alice's plight in both universes, up and under.
0.375 Its single biggest failing -- an affront to Lewis Carroll and the charms of nonsense literature -- is the fact that it makes sense.
0.6 It's very cool to look at, Depp is entertaining, Helena Bonham Carter is memorably crazy, and the too-conventional you-go-girl plotline is just an add-on to the visual cake.
0.7 Despite its flaws, Wonderland is stuffed with more minute to minute amusement than you're likely to get in anything else drifting through theaters, in or out of the third dimension.
0.75 The true three-dimensionality here is the old-fashioned kind -- Wasikowska's fully rounded performance. Throughout the technical razzle-dazzle, we keep returning to the pallor of that face, the gravity in those eyes.
0.4 The picture is oddly flat -- a disjointed pageant of virtuoso effects. It's a triumph of design that falls short of wonderment.
0.5 Visually stunning and sporadically amusing, but lacks thrills, heart and cleverness. It's ultimately too scary for little kids and too unimaginative, pedestrian and bland for grown-ups.
0.75 Despite its sluggish start, "Alice" is an enchanting, witty and funny adventure filled with marvelous sights and set pieces.
0.8 All new 3-D Alice story is trippy and intense.
1.0 Burton and Disney have found a glorious way to interpret fairy tales and fantasies.
0.4 Purists will be perplexed and the average moviegoer ultimately disinterested by director Tim Burton's pedestrian spin of Lewis Carroll's 1865 classic.
0.375 It jumbles together a half-dozen or so other overproduced fantasies and wraps them up with typical, tiresome Disney bromides and just enough snippets from the originals to remind you of what you're missing.
0.75 Burton brings his distinctive touch and Johnny Depp, Mia Wasikowska and Helena Bonham Carter do their stuff but a hodgepodge of Hollywood conventionality lessens the wonder.
0.9 There are certain cine-marriages that generate an indelible spark all their own. Tracy & Hepburn, Bogie & Bacall -- and now we get Tim Burton & 3D, creating the world we hoped for, and so much more.
0.875 The trippy tale may divide audiences -- Burton's version remains a children's story, though some may find it too over-the-top and idiosyncratic -- but to Us, it's a visual feast
0.625 a decent movie, but not the amazing, mindblowing, set the world on fire, change your life and curl your toes film people expect and want.
0.5 This Alice is a dud. If you want to experience a strange, unworldly story%u2014something like Tim Burton films used to provide%u2014stay home and read the book.
0.6 Much of Carroll's magical nonsense remains, even if Burton's film wobbles at the gates of anarchy and ends up being a more average affair than many might expect.
0.75 Such a delightfully giddy, silly, delirious movie. Tim Burton isn't being "Tim Burton" but is just having fun again, scrambling up the expected pieces
0.4 Disney family fun with the odd carefully calculated dark patch. Fine on its own terms, but a let-down given the talent involved. Disappointinger and disappointinger.
0.4 I can't rid myself of the feeling that for all the funkily crepuscular mood that Burton creates, this is a pretty conventional work.
0.625 Rated PG, according to the MPAA, for fantasy violence and 'a smoking caterpillar.' The Jefferson Airplane would be proud; Lewis Carroll devotees, however, may be less than enthusiastic...
0.75 Impressive eye-candy, elaborate and gorgeously detailed in wall-to-wall CGI (the 3-D seems rather half-hearted though; this is one that won't suffer much in regular old 2-D).
0.5 The episodic nature of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland doesn't really lend itself to traditional three-act plotting, but screenwriter Linda Woolverton puts Alice through her Joseph Campbell reluctant-hero paces, and none of it ever sparks.
0.8 If it could be bottled up, the label would read "watch me."
0.75 A sumptuous, bar-raising cinematic portmanteau that both honors and complements the source material.
0.7 The film is like eating an amazing peanut butter and jelly sandwich except that Tim Burton forgot to cut off the crust. The beginning and the end could have been cut out.
0.4 The wavering tone is as uncertain as Alice's decision-making, while the added-on 3-D is a distraction and as unconvincing as the entire misconceived venture.
0.2 What's shocking about Alice in Wonderland is just how woefully conventional it all is.
0.6 Is Alice In Wonderland worth seeing? Yes, because it's a feast for the eyes. But the story needed to be more imaginative and involving for this to become a massive hit, and it's far from obvious whether it's aimed at children or adults.
0.4 Burton doesn't just hit the bottom of the barrel but drills through the wood and starts tunnelling. Its only saving grace are the arresting, if familiar, visuals.
0.6 It's nowhere near his best work but a superb voice cast, Helena Bonham Carter and a few moments of brilliance see it through.
0.625 It is time for Tim Burton to get his nose out of his own sketchbook.
0.2 You cannot believe the dreadfulness of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland - gifted director takes on gaga script - until you see it. Enchantment has gone thataway.
0.875 IBurton and Woolverton pursue a message of self-fulfilment, not as vigorously as they might chase a rabbit but to the same delightful end.
0.4 Burton, once a master of CGI, has gradually become its servant, or at least has allowed the studio to. The madcap ringmaster of Gothic phantasmagoria does not exert his individual stamp on a book one might have thought he was born to film.
0.7 CGI has not been good to Tim Burton. The ability to see every unrestrained nuance of his vision fulfilled has robbed his films of the creative zest and inventive verve which marked his earlier classics.
0.6 Burton's Alice In Wonderland joins the ranks of Return To Oz and Hook in confirming that it's rarely a good idea to return to the scene of a classic novel unless you have something new and exciting to bring.
0.6 After the first 45 minutes, the film becomes as tedious as Johnny Depp's accent.
0.8 This magical world looks fantastic, especially in 3D.
0.75 It's a workmanlike effort that will enchant all but the youngest children while holding the interest of parents. That, by definition, makes for a worthwhile family outing.
0.4 You would think that a director like Burton would be at home in the Lewis Carroll universe, and maybe that is part of the problem.
0.75 Faithful to Lewis Carroll's vision or not, I liked the ride Tim Burton took me on here.
0.5 A regretful dud, a fantasy without magic and very little heart and soul.
0.65 Did Burton get bored in Wonderland? The end result is a movie that is decently enjoyable escapism, but entirely forgettable in the long run.
0.5 this parable of how Alice must find the balls to chart her own path through the patriarchy of her Victorian wood to become a real, bona fide, 1960s-era bra-burner.
0.4 It's more of a blunder than a wonder.
0.6 An exotic adventure tale about a young woman's trip to an alternate reality and the testing of her will power, resourcefulness, and courage in the face of weirdness and danger.
0.625 Burton, one of the great visual artists in Hollywood history, is incapable of making an uninteresting movie. Still, I'm not looking forward to the sequel promised in the last scene.
0.625 Even Disney and a PG rating can't bury Burton's subversive wit. Like Carroll, he's a master at dressing up psychic wounds in fantasy.
0.5 Indecision haunts every frame. The result is a clattering, hectic spectacle that by the end has run out of inspiration. It's a home for abandoned ideas.
1.0 A, my name is Alice, and my movie is amazing.
0.875 Though it has a few moments where you can see Burton's imagination giving way to Disney convention, along with a bit of trademark Burton darkness, the pleasures of Alice are virtually always unexpected.
0.75 Carroll purists are likely to dismiss this Alice as spuriouser and spuriouser. But who expects a faithful adaptation of a literary classic from Timothy Beetlejuice?
0.5 The sweetly surreal feeling of those original books has been lost. What always felt like an English garden party gone slightly off has been replaced by the grotesque and the Gothic and the overdone.
0.75 In many respects, this is the most crowd-pleasing Burton film in many years.
0.7 Visually fascinating yet perturbing and scary, it's not a very young children's movie, despite the PG rating.
0.5 In its big-budget extraordinariness, Alice is awfully...ordinary.
0.6 A disappointment that's still worth seeing, Alice in Wonderland lands near the higher end of Burton's lesser work.
0.4 It's just hard to know why Mr. Burton, who doesn't seem much interested in Alice, bothered.
0.0 Combines the heavy-handed clamminess of unneeded brand remarketing with the hateful hollowness of overdone and empty computer-generated imagery. ... With Burton's uninspired, underdone and underwritten version, you only feel like you're watching money.
0.8 Burton treats his material with abandon, but not contempt, and he has brought his Mad Hatter's imagination to a new generation who have not yet read the books.
0.5 This Wonderland is just listless, bland and derivative -- a mere technical undertaking from a disinterested filmmaker.
0.6 Sadly Lewis lite and not without flaws but this is as Burtonesque as one could wish for, a real treat for fans of his twisted imagination and great British character actors.
0.4 unfulfilling
0.625 The film is always fun, but as Carroll might have observed, it's not much of a muchness.
0.6 What a letdown.
0.4 One pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small, and the pills Tim Burton gives you don't do very much at all.
0.8 [Depp's] wide eyes and high whimsy feel a bit derivative of his Willy Wonka (another collaboration with Burton), but he invests so much of his ample energy and instinct in these roles that it's hard to complain.
0.5 The most wondrous thing about director Tim Burton's take on the Lewis Carroll classic is how lacking in wonder it all is.
0.6 "Frabjous" may be a word Carroll invented, but Burton knows just what it means, at least in his own mind. He's clearly excited to invite us inside, and as long as you're open to so much muchness, you'll be very glad he did.
0.4 Considering what a to-do this massively budgeted entertainment is, that doesn't add up to much. "Curiouser and curiouser," indeed.
0.25 It might be time for Johnny Depp and Tim Burton to start thinking about seeing other people.
0.5 A stiff movie ... finds a way to make a lot of really weird stuff surprisingly boring.
0.5 Here's a riddle: What's Alice in Wonderland without wonder? It's a beloved character landing in the rubble of wrong-headed revisionism.
0.5 Did no one bother to mention to Burton that Lewis Carroll's 1865 story was not a Lord of the Rings primer but, in fact, a comedy?
0.6 Tim Burton's creative juices run dry in a decidedly boring and bland interpretation of Alice in Wonderland.
0.8 A sharply detailed, wondrously three-dimensional fantasy in which its maker intuitively grasps so much of what's good about the tale while simultaneously blind to what makes it great.
0.625 Alice in Wonderland isn't quite the natural fit of director and material that it seemed to be on paper, but most of Burton's recent movies have been far more disappointing.
0.75 Its best and strangest interludes assert Burton's skills as a fantasist, as well as Depp's as a squirrely, inventive character actor.
0.75 Alice plays better as an adult hallucination, which is how Burton rather brilliantly interprets it until a pointless third act flies off the rails.
0.6 Alice in Wonderland is something of a mixed bag -- it's worth seeing for the effects and performances but it's badly let down by a very disappointing script.
0.6 An entirely suitable marriage of material and filmmaker.
0.6 Amid the visual pleasures, the plot additions feel limiting.
0.625 Tweedlee and Tweedledum could have come up with a more compelling pseudo-sequel concept and crafted a more cohesive narrative.
0.75 Purists will squeal, but it's a workable and watchable liberty to take with an oft-filmed yet impossible to film novel.
0.8 Carroll purists and freshman English majors may be aghast at the change in story, but for those who watched Avatar and marveled at the images but were left wanting by the wooden acting and tired story, Alice is a treat.
0.5 It's as though the script meeting was held at the Mad Hatter's tea party, with all the ideas put in teacups and thrown against the wall - all of them seem to have stuck but in no particular order.
0.6 Kids will drool at Burton's spectacle - grown-ups too - but they might also find this isn't the nostalgia trip they hoped for. Where's the bottle marked 'Feel Me'?
0.8 A wildly inventive film straitjacketed in conventional narrative form.
0.8 Although the simplistic plot has been done before and smacks of Narnia and Lord Of The Rings, Burton's Alice In Wonderland is family fantasy/adventure at its Gothic best.
0.6 The visual inventiveness in this film is so impressive that it almost makes up for the ill-conceived script, which tries to turn Lewis Carroll's classic tales into a Lord of the Rings-sized post-apocalyptic adventure epic.
0.4 The most curious thing about this magical realist fable is how charmless and ultimately forgettable it turns out to be in the hands of Tim Burton.
0.4 A bore and an affront to anyone who is even familiar with the concept of Lewis Carroll and his books.
0.6 Curiouser and curiouser -- but then, mixing fantasy and free enterprise has always been the Disney way.
0.6 The challenge of reinventing Alice in Wonderland sees Tim Burton reinvigorated and refreshed. Visually stunning and filled with a delightfully deranged group of inhabitants, Burton's immensely enjoyable Wonderland is well worth a visit.
0.6 Wasikowska is a standout in the title role. And, as to be expected, Depp thrives as the Mad Hatter.
0.6 It's a shame Burton gets his Lewis Carroll mixed up with his Tolkien and CS Lewis. Still, the film's 3D visuals are fun to look at.
0.8 An explosion in the crazy factory, the giddy Alice in Wonderland more than justifies its hype.
0.9 ...it is The Red Queen, played by Bonham Carter that shines the brightest. Her childlike villain is brilliantly played in all its giant head glory
0.5 There's a lot to look at in Burton's Alice in Wonderland, but nothing that's worth remembering.
0.625 Tim Burton's version of Alice in Wonderland is a succession of fantastically gothic pranks--noisy, exhausting, and under-realized, but also frequently dazzling and frightening.
0.55 People who enjoy high fantasy like Carroll's classic work are more than happy to experience the insanity, but don't necessarily want to be driven insane themselves.
0.2 A bona fide, bums-in-the-air fiasco that needs to be burned and the ashes hurtled off in the direction of the nearest black hole as soon as you can, NASA.
0.4 Suffering from a severe deficiency of wonder, this Alice is by turns loud, lifeless and lacklustre, and so what should have been the perfect marriage of moviemaker and material instead does justice to neither.
0.6 You're not going to lose yourself in the story or the characters but visually Alice in Wonderland is a series of moving artworks that are a joy to gaze upon despite lacking any depth, even in 3D.
0.4 Tim Burton tosses $150 million down the rabbit hole with this gorgeously rendered -- but utterly disposable -- CGI epic.
0.9 Director Tim Burton returns to his 'A' game with this magnificent, visually stunning movie that is not only one of his best, it is indeed a wonder.
0.8 The closest you'll get to absolute madness without being locked in a room with padded walls...a wondrous piece of escapism.
0.8 Alice in Wonderland is a lovingly filmed and meticulously crafted interpretation of Lewis Carroll's treasured tale, rife with fantasy, coated in gothic iconography and presented by a superb cast who nail their characters' portraits.
0.5 An almost uniformly substandard follow-up that, since the original film remains so beloved by so many people, still gets to be disappointing even two decades and change later.
0.75 A little of a rehash but still good.
0.6 Almost as sharp as the first film and only suffering slightly from the inevitable repetitions.
0.375 A terrible disappointment, a shockingly self-satisfied and unforgivably slapdash sequel.
0.5 Feels like a blueprint concocted by the bean-counters at Columbia Pictures.
0.75 Bottom line: with Murray on fire and enough clever dialogue to rival its predecessor, Ghostbusters II is good enough to put post-milennial comedy to shame.
0.6 No one has ever accused Ghostbusters II of being a great film, or even a good one, for that matter
0.4 Best forgotten sequel.
0.8 A loose, assured sequel that has the breezy ambition of simply being fun and likable. And it is.
0.6 A few bright moments thanks to the cast.
0.7 Even the special effects are more to the point of the comedy than they were in the first film. For some reason, this appears to leave more room for the sort of random funny business that Mr. Murray and his friends do best.
0.6 About equal to the original. Neither of them were classics.
0.75 There's plenty to enjoy here and fans of the group won't care about the shortcomings.
0.2 There are some pretty decent stunts-especially the one where the two main Uni-Sols go rappelling face-first down Hoover Dam-but they hardly make this $23-million turkey worth your eight bucks.
0.5 With no real plot tying them together, the impressively staged big scenes become empty exercises in logistics, while the smaller scenes never develop any momentum.
0.8 Roland Emmerich's best film, and Lundgren's best acting job. Admittedly that ain't saying much in either case, but a fun flick all in all.
0.625 In the end, the main drawback is the brainlessness of the story and the lack of a believable emotional payoff.
0.5 Universal Soldier may flex its muscles at every opportunity, but it's still second-rate Schwarzenegger.
0.4 Even with this early movie, [Emmerich] had a propensity for stealing cliches from other movies...
0.5 I suppose there is a market for this sort of thing among bubblebrained adolescents of all ages, but it takes a good chase scene indeed to rouse me from the lethargy induced by dozens and dozens of essentially similar sequences.
0.2 De tao ruim, torna-se divertido. Com o perdao do trocadilho: onde Milland estava com a cabeca quando aceitou participar desta coisa?
0.8 Charming, wordless, book-based holiday fable for all ages.
0.4 Forgettable but pretty entertaining sea-monster flick with a good cast and nice Greek locations
0.1 This wannabe epic is forgettable, bland and way too long.
0.625 "John Carter" is certainly an interesting idea for a film, with a power struggle on an alien world and an outsider affecting the balance, but sadly it never ends up fully working.
0.8 If Cecil B. DeMille were alive today and given the chance to direct a special effects-laden fantasy adventure on Mars, he might have made something similar to Andrew Stanton's visually stunning epic "John Carter."
0.9 One of the best sci-fi fantasy films in a long, long time.
0.6 John Carter is a visual delight at times, but the classic story is tiresome and the characters are largely unmemorable, leaving a cold, only occasionally thrilling experience.
0.625 An undeniable disaster...of marketing. Join me on a tour of media headaches, and why they don't necessarily reflect the quality of the movie itself. [Blu-ray 3D]
0.8 Under Stanton's care 'John Carter' is the kind of tremendous fun-filled film that's worth going to the theater to see.
0.8 John Carter is for fans of pure, joyous, escapist, adventure cinema. Seeing John Carter unfamiliar with the text; it's very clear that the original text has influenced a hell of a lot of Sci-fi flicks that we've seen before.
0.75 OK, they botched the title. But not the movie itself.
0.5 Isn't the disaster some industry observers predicted, but it's not the high-gloss masterpiece some of us hoped for either.
0.5 I understand John Carter likes being on Mars (superpowers + hot, intelligent princess). I just don't want to be there with him.
0.875 John Carter is an instant classic... Disney should be ashamed of themselves for treating Mars like a red-headed step planet.
0.5 A bloated sci-fi epic from Disney that's made watchable by swell effects, passable performances and those little dashes of humor that reassure us that the filmmakers know this is all a lark.
0.8 Manages to overcome an inflated running time and occasional bouts of cuteness by remembering and embracing its pulp fiction roots as an 'interplanetary romance.'
0.4 The finished entity feels like a rip-off of a film that ripped-off several rip-offs of Carter's own ancient source material.
0.5 ...the movie's disappointingly flat atmosphere [is] perpetuated by Kitsch's competent yet bland work...
1.05 As one of Pixar's star players, Stanton is an experienced cinematic storyteller, which is why it's disappointing that his first live-action project is so unwieldy at times.
0.375 an awesome folly, a misguided project of genuinely enormous proportions that feels like exactly what it is: an impersonal product of franchise-hungry corporate culture
0.5 Romance, action, humor, and even some philosophical gristle: Is war a cosmic constant? Is anything worth fighting for?
0.5 [Provides] dumbfounding sci-fi vistas in admirable quantity if not quite in creativity.
0.6 With this production budget, you'd think someone in the creative chain might have detected that there was too much dramatic dithering in the screenplay, but entertainment factors survive.
0.7 Ignore the naysayers, this is a very enjoyable action adventure
0.875 Great fun as we endure scrape after scrape in this wild, near-hallucinatory landscape, and director Stanton finds the right balance of cheerful solemnity and cheeky humor.
0.7 It is fascinating to spend time with this visualization of Burroughs's Mars/Barsoom.
0.4 With a narrative as flat and barren as the red martian landscape, John Carter is a big-budget sci-fi spectacle that fails to excite or entertain.
0.8 ... great fun ...
0.7 It's too bad that Burroughs' ideas don't seem quite as fresh now that others have outraced Carter to the big screen.
0.5 A film version of John Carter has been in the works since 1931. That means Hollywood has had 81 years to get a decent script together and this is the best they could do?
0.4 Based on a 1912 Edgar Rice Burroughs novel, John Carter is an overlong, muddled mess of a film that should've waited another hundred years for a good script.
0.625 There are some fantastic sights in John Carter, but there's also a lot of overkill, with Stanton and crew often cluttering up the visuals with the deranged frenzy of George Lucas retooling his Star Wars sagas.
0.5 I felt like there was this awesome party going on that I just didn't have an invitation to. It seems that if you'd read the books, this would have been awesome.
0.4 There's no surer-fire way for a film to ink its own $250-million obituary than by contrasting itself to two of Hollywood's most titanic films when it only has half the heart, soul and story of either one.
0.6 There is no real sense of connection between human and alien - like between the Na'vi and Jake Sully - that would have pulled John Carter out of the grandiose B-movie league.
0.6 Chega a surpreender que uma narrativa tao absurda em essencia tambem possa ser tao lenta e frequentemente entediante.
0.8 John Carter is a product of a simpler time, when sense of adventure was paramount, and the film has this in spades.
0.7 A thoroughly entertaining adaptation of Burroughs's second most famous literary creation, with enough adventure and humor to satisfy all but those who are wholly dead inside.
0.7 The entire story behind John Carter is the essence of high concept, especially in the day and age it was originally created... a blast of a film.
0.5 It isn't that John Carter is bad, it's just really mediocre. And mediocrity is deadly in this genre.
0.5 Director Andrew Stanton, making his first live-action feature after the successful Pixar animated films FINDING NEMO and WALL-E, hasn't been able to bring anything very new to the familiar story of battles among rival forces on another planet:
0.4 Stanton should go back to making machines talk. He puts much more humanity into them than he manages to extract from Burroughs, even with all that nostalgia working for him.
0.4 John Carter's hard-to-follow story and terrible dialogue leaves it on par with that cheesy Flash Gordon remake from the 1980s.
0.1 Wall-E and Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton must shoulder the blame for this over-bloated disaster. It's impossible to care about the protagonists, played by the helplessly wooden Kitsch and Collins.
0.6 There's a delightfully unfashionable cheesiness about John Carter, a film for all the family, but in particular sci-fi fantasy geeks and older gentlemen who have never been able to relinquish the spiffing derring-do of Burroughs.
0.7 Go for the spectacle, go for the fun, just don't expect anything as significant as the impact made by Burroughs' books.
0.25 all that's missing is a senate debate and a pod race.
0.8 This is an old-fashioned movie told with cutting-edge technology and while it is easy to be cynical about such a lightweight plotline, it is refreshing to see a movie that approaches its subject with an authentic, wide-eyed sense of wonder.
0.375 Disney and director Andrew Stanton may have dusted off the creaky franchise and wrapped it in $300 million worth of 3-D digital effects, but the final product still feels like ancient history.
0.5 It's got the schmaltz and grandeur of the 80s Clash of the Titans but little of the warm wonder that made that spectacle such an addiction.
0.75 This hodgepodge falls together neatly, because we know the film will go exactly where we want it to go, right down to the intervention by a faithful, comic animal sidekick (a Pixar specialty).
0.6 Mars-based action epic has strong fantasy violence.
0.75 Fortunately for viewers, the film is directed by Pixar sensation Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, WALL-E), and the visual effects are, literally, out of this world.
0.75 Directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton of "Finding Nemo," "Toy Story" and "Monsters, Inc." fame, the fun but sometimes confusing "John Carter" may launch the next big sci-fi-adventure franchise.
0.75 Since its story inspired every mainstream fantasy right up to Avatar, John Carter may seem a little old-fashioned, but it's a solid piece of fantasy entertainment that's equal parts corny and poignant.
0.625 Comical Woola, a faithful dog-like creature that travels at Road Runner superspeed, steals every scene. He's the 'John Carter' equivalent of Uggie, and the movie, sad to say, needs him.
0.875 John Carter, a rousing science-fiction adventure adapted from Edgar Rice Burroughs' early 20th-century pulp novels, is a rare bird that's at the same time strikingly modern and engagingly old-fashioned.
0.75 "John Carter" enthusiastically remains a pulp story at heart.
0.75 Visionary and philosophical, with the sort of complex allusions to death, immortality and the destruction of civilizations that you don't expect from a $250 million film.
0.625 Whenever the fighting stops and two people have to stand and talk, all the air goes out of everything. Suddenly it feels as if we're in an empty theater, watching a dusty old sword-and-sandal epic.
0.375 "John Carter's" biggest miscalculation is the casting of Taylor Kitsch as Carter. He is too soft and wooden. He lacks the gravitas needed to be an inspirational leader, no matter how high or far he can jump in Barsoom's lesser gravity.
1.05 While we can still marvel at the amazing sights laid out before us, it is imperative that we never lose sight of who's who and what's at stake. That turns out to be a tall order.
0.8 Saturday afternoon matinee fun. Think Conan the Barbarian clashing with the gods of Clash of the Titans who are conquering Mars, Gladiator style.
0.5 Director Stanton has yet to find his rhythm in this new-to-him discipline. Though the 3D Mars-scape and fantastical creatures offer fun viewing ... he can't quite conquer the human beast.
0.58 John Carter is arriving late to the party, after George Lucas had already pillaged the source material and squeezed it for every dollar it was worth. Stanton has created a sci-fi adventure that feels both old hat and sub-par.
0.75 I just had fun at John Carter. Stupid, old school, science fiction fun. It's the kind of science fiction that doesn't get bogged down in the science part and fully embraces the fiction.
0.5 This is truly a story I'd rather go to the library and read then watch again.
0.6 For all of the love and money lavished upon John Carter it ends up feeling a touch musty and overly familiar.
0.5 Confusing and, at times, positively frustrating, John Carter is a film that screams too much post-production tinkering. During the screening, I actually turned to Film Fix co-host Jeff Marker and asked him if we had missed a reel.
0.125 If John Carter was a date, you would be running off to the bathroom to call a friend, so the friend would call you ten minutes later with an "emergency", so you could get away.
0.5 Surprisingly humorless, unevenly jumbled fantasy - Blame it on solar flares!
0.5 It isn't bad so much as innocuous, $250-million worth of innocuous, framed by a decent start and a solid finish but sagging through the long middle like a cheap mattress.
0.5 Please fight somebody, John! At least it'll stop them from talking.
0.625 Though messy and overlong, it's an enjoyable throwback to the movie spectacles of a more innocent age.
0.25 Gets off to such an incoherent start that it takes almost the entire, interminable two-hour-plus running time to catch up.
0.5 It's easy to be fascinated with how John Carter looks, but it's difficult to get emotionally involved.
0.625 Like any template, it has the skeleton but is missing the meat.
0.75 Suffers from a convoluted plot and an anticlimactic resolution, but hits enough high notes along the way to be enjoyable.
0.5 The villains are overwrought and the design of Mars is surprisingly bland.
0.25 "Thank God that's over with!" one character utters near the end of "John Carter." No spoken words have ever been truer.
0.6 Kitsch...makes for an excellent hero, even managing to make a loincloth look like this year's must-have item.
0.6 Incredibly well made and heroically performed. It also really delivers when it comes to creating a strange alien world.
0.0 Stanton's screenwriting skills are, on this evidence, slightly below those of George Lucas, so there's plenty of clunky exposition and such inadvertent laugh-lines as: 'I would lay down my life for Helium.'
0.75 The visuals are stunning, the battles are exciting and the supporting cast is strong. Why, then, did Disney stupidly do everything they could to ensure that it would fail?
0.25 There's nothing to see, nothing to think about, nothing to care about, and nothing to feel, just emptiness. The emptiness is never filled over the course of 132 long, barren minutes.
0.2 Amazing how little a century of anticipation and $250 million buys out these days
0.4 There's a lot of hokey fun in old pulp stories like Burroughs', but John Carter fails to capture any of that charm.
0.4 Like watching a storm; yes there are flashes of lightning but most of the time you're just staring at boring grey clouds. After enduring the 132 minutes of John Carter tug-of-war it's not a complete win for team terrible but pretty damn close.
0.6 Messy and chaotic ... but also colorful and kind of fun.
0.625 Kitsch, best known for TV's "Friday Night Lights," proves able to front a movie. The Canadian is as reliable as "Avatar" lead Sam Worthington, with a mix of good looks, brawn and generic heroism.
0.4 It starts with a great story - of love and politics, time travel and mystical pathways between planets - badly sucked dry.
0.5 There's a lot of coming and going in 'John Carter,' and most of the time I wasn't exactly sure where they're coming from or going to.
0.6 All of these characters, and the richly detailed backdrops, are utterly immersive and lifelike - even without the completely unnecessary 3-D.
0.25 It's hard to believe Pixar's founder would have signed off on this project. The film is as overcomplicated, bloated and crash-prone as a bad-old-days Microsoft release.
0.625 There's something generic about the digitally rendered Martians (whatever their stripe and skin tone), and there's a corniness to the dialogue that keeps the audience from any kind of emotional attachment to the Tharks and Zodangans and their ilk.
0.625 "Carter" is so good-natured, and so goofy, that it's hard to completely dislike. But impossible, I think, to understand.
0.75 Against the odds, "John Carter'' is itself pretty amazing - an epic pulp saga that slowly rises to the level of its best imitations and wins you over by degrees.
0.4 For Pixar prodigy Andrew Stanton directing and co-writing, it was obviously a labour of love. But for two hours, as with any problem birth, we get more labour than love.
0.625 "John Carter" may not be a perfect movie, but it's one where you can safely plunk down your money, grab your box of popcorn and come away reasonably satisfied when the closing credits roll.
0.8 A true thinking man's thrill ride.
0.25 It looks as if Disney simply borrowed and recycled the sets of Prince of Persia and Gladiator, adding leftover props from The Phantom Menace and Cowboys and Aliens.
0.8 Sets a high standard for the event movies to follow.
0.75 John Carter is so eager to please that, despite its overblown execution, it still manages to feel intimate and fun.
0.7 Disney bet a whopping $250 million on this becoming its next big franchise, and personally, I'm hoping audiences fall for this displaced yet dashing Southern gentleman and his newfound life abroad.
0.375 Even genre film lovers have standards, and "John Carter" doesn't meet them.
0.625 Like its four-armed Tharks and its ten-legged Calot, this adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs's series of sci-fi novels has too many moving parts for its own good.
0.2 I felt as if someone had dragged me into the kitchen of my local Greggs, and was baking my head into the centre of a colossal cube of white bread.
0.6 While "John Carter" is undeniably silly, sprawling and easy to make fun of, it's also playful, genuinely epic and absolutely comfortable being what it is. In this genre, those are virtues as rare as a cave of gold.
0.625 I liked it, and if you're a sci-fi/fantasy fan, you'll probably like it even more.
0.4 It looks fantastic and youngsters may find the exotic universe compelling enough but the result is sadly soulless and unexciting.
0.4 The overriding feeling with John Carter is that there is an epic film to be made from this material, but this just isn't it.
0.4 It feels less like a revival of a classic saga than a rip-off twice removed. Almost everything on screen is old hat, and the few details that have remained fresh for the past 100 years haven't been imitated for good reason.
0.8 An oft-confusing, occasionally silly mega-expensive thrill ride that, for sheer audacity, is the biggest thing to come down the cinematic pike since Avatar.
0.625 Beautifully-realized visuals nearly make up for the well-worn story in this Disney adaptation of the Edgar Rice Burroughs character.
0.75 Not your grandfather's John Carter.
0.5 The difference with Indiana Jones or Pirates of the Caribbean is that most of their action is memorable and filtered through a charismatic hero who fills in the downtime. The flat turns the story takes make it more The Adjustment Bureau meets Spaceballs.
0.625 Often feels silly but only occasionally fun.
0.8 This lavish production of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burrough's space adventure has much to recommend it.
0.375 A cheesy looking (the 3-D adds nothing to the picture) quasi-epic filled with dullish characters and chaotically staged action scenes.
0.5 The major problem here is one of rooting interest. I hate to sound like a mogul, or a focus group ho, but at the center of this picture is a flat, inexpressive protagonist played by a flat, inexpressive actor.
0.625 The action sequences are generally well-executed, but they're too much of a muchness. CGI makes them seem too facile and not tactile enough.
0.6 It overcomes the adversity of cliche by being exciting and mildly intelligent, with a sufficient amount of humour and heart.
0.75 ...has more personality than anyone should rightly expect from a two-hour-plus, CGI-heavy, sci-fi fantasy epic.
0.375 Yes, there is life on Mars in "John Carter," and it's deadly dull.
0.4 It's sometimes wondrous and often amazingly goofy.
0.85 A modern pulp adventure in the classic Spielberg and Lucas vein, John Carter is exactly what pointless entertainment should be but often isn't
0.85 Andrew Stanton has created a fantastic and magical epic that makes "John Carter" the rightful heir to the Star Wars legacy.
0.75 John Carter manages to be a ridiculous amount of fun, even if you are immune to the charms of Taylor Kitsch running around in what amounts to a stylish loincloth.
0.5 Somehow, despite that boatload of talent, the movie never really comes together.
0.6 Director Andrew Stanton has a strong sense of what makes "adventure" adventurous, helping John Carter encapsulate everything about a great time at the movies.
0.4 The film is at least half-an-hour too long and is often as dull as Will Smith's repulsively silly Wild Wild West.
0.6 An adventure that feels real and fantastical at the same time.
0.8 Beautifully designed and impressively directed, this is a thoroughly enjoyable, emotionally engaging space opera with an intelligent script, strong characters, terrific special effects and superb performances from Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins.
0.4 Aside from a few inspired vistas and alien life-forms, John Carter is as deadly dull as its basso-voiced, beefcake slab of a star.
0.25 It's hard to care about anything going on in this shapeless would-be franchise, which lurches from scene to scene without building any real excitement.
0.125 It's both abrupt and languorous, a wall-to-wall exhibition of design work where nobody had the basic decency to make sure the designs were good.
0.6 Lavish and lengthy, it has the spectacle and spirit of a Saturday matinee movie but not its fleetness or fun.
0.8 For me, this is the first movie of its kind in a very long time that I'd willingly sit through a second or even third time.
0.8 A terrific time at the movies. Comes a lot closer to being on-par with the beloved sci-fi movies of our youth than most modern blockbusters.
0.6 A very entertaining, unusual and loveable mess.
0.6 Just about every sci-fi/fantasy/superhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere.
0.9 A fun story, impressive alien world, and cool 3D effects make John Carter a surprise treat that may not have been on your radar.
0.4 Arid, barren Barsoom is a dull environment for a sci-fi blockbuster, and the consequences of the conflicts happening on screen are small. John Carter just never pulled me in.
0.6 A handsome new sci-fi adventure that feels rather familiar. Enjoyable enough while it lasts, John Carter is big on ambition and disappointingly short on action.
0.4 The story veers between interesting, boring and borderline incomprehensible.
0.8 John Carter is a fantastic fusion of old-fashioned adventure excitement and modern blockbuster spectacle. In short, it's wonderful.
0.8 Lynn Collins's feisty Dejah Thoris is the best kick-ass sci-fi princess since Leia
0.8 When John Carter moves up the gears it's an accomplished blockbuster packed with pulse-racing action.
0.5 Perhaps the sequel - if we ever get there - will fill in the gaps and expand on John Carter's legend now all the expositional heavy-lifting has been done. But is that an acceptable excuse for an epic to be this underwhelming?
0.8 John Carter is a fun blockbuster. There is fun in its action scenes, in its jaw dropping imagery and especially in its surprising sense of humour that Andrew Stanton melds well with its brand of sci-fi spectacular.
0.5 The film's long middle is still a slog, but the beginning and ending are loud and weird enough to supply solid entertainment.
0.4 I may not be a doctor but believe me there is no way that Stewart and Pattinson would ever produce a baby this ugly.
0.875 The Twilight series comes to a close with this uneven yet satisfying finale that effectively wraps up the saga of these vivid, almost iconic characters...
0.6 I rolled my eyes, laughed at, and laughed with this film. I was entertained. It's a sloppy enjoyable mess, and the most fun I had watching a 'Twilight' movie.
0.5 Hopelessly dumb and often unintentionally funny. As with everything about this nutty series, I couldn't shake the feeling that Stephenie Meyer's creation is just kooky in all the wrong ways.
0.6 if you haven't seen any of them - why not see this one? It's crazy fun for less than two hours ... It's all very tonally specific, and the tone is bonkers. But it's so intriguing, and everyone looks so good ... the guiltiest pleasure of the year.
0.5 In one of Stephenie Meyer's weirder conceits, Jacob 'imprints' on Bella's daughter: This may be the most awkward way to resolve a love triangle since Luke discovered Leia was his sister.
0.625 Condon, the cast, and the crew of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 have made something they can be proud of.
0.8 "Breaking Dawn Part 2" offers readers and moviegoers the ending they hoped for. Only problem is most will be asking for more and wishing it was not the final chapter.
0.7 The big payoff to the Twilight saga is a solidly mounted, carefully directed exercise in franchise box-ticking... Even the decapitations are done tastefully.
0.6 The perfect ending of the series for those who are fans of the books, but for the rest it is a little overdone and confusing.
0.5 At a key point, coven leader Aro (Michael Sheen) lets out a spectacular laugh - which nearly drowned out my own.
0.2 Not nearly enough shots of Taylor's abs.
0.4 Even for a franchise that is horribly light on drama, nothing at all happens here.
0.5 And so it ends -- better than it started, but still a few brain cells shy of lucid thought.
0.375 Oh, my, what a cheat is in store for viewers of 'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2.'
0.2 A reminder that the journey has been a murmur rather than a saga, and the final plod is no exception
0.55 From bottom of my heart thank you. And thank you to Bella, Edward and Jacob for letting us laugh, cry, debate, and pick sides while you three bastards stare at each other.
0.6 Bloodier, funnier and even more ridiculous, but the final chapter of this saga is better paced than the Potterthon.
0.5 The fifth and final entry in the historically successful "Twilight" franchise is the most self-aware and in some ways the most entertaining.
0.375 Well, thank god that's over.
0.6 There are better ways to spend your evening. Perhaps there's some laundry to be done?
0.5 I'll probably never understand the popularity of the Twilight movies. They're haphazardly assembled adaptations of awful books.
0.375 As for the millions that have had to suffer through this series, we celebrate the end of one of the worst franchises in cinematic history and are thankful that we no longer have to dread more of this soap opera that should have been cancelled long ago.
0.5 The Twilight films can hardly be considered masterpieces, but neither do they deserve the fear and loathing from male moviegoers threatened by the very existence of any franchise aimed at women. Still, this one fares the worst in practically every regard.
0.625 Twihards, don't rip my head off for saying this, but I enjoyed your reaction to the final Twilight movie than the actual movie, although it was better than the awful Part I.
0.6 Syrupy, suspensful and surreal, proclaiming this final segment as the best of the 'Twilight' saga is damning with faint praise.
0.5 If you removed the endless soulful gazes, this whole series could've been delivered as a two-night SyFy Channel exclusive and wrapped up before the next airing of Sharktopus.
0.6 The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 won't win any converts to either Team Edward or Team Jacob, but it has enough appeal to extend beyond the hardcore fans who attend ritualistically as a form of tribal identifier...
0.0 Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 is an unredeemable waste of time and money. Like the vampire characters it's utterly lifeless and yet by that monstrous twist of fate - it exists.
0.2 The Twilight Saga has finally ended, not with a triumphant roar but with the self-satisfied mumble of an inconsiderate lover rolling over and breaking wind as they fall asleep
0.8 The ultimate catharsis, giving the series' detractors exactly what they've wanted to see all these many years [and] telling the story that Twihards wanted to see too.
0.4 It's a mess
0.3 Much like The Human Centipede 2, Breaking Dawn: Part 2 completely fails as a serious film, but it makes one heck of an entertaining comedy.
0.6 'Breaking Dawn - Part 2' is the best of the series, despite the terrible CGI, mediocre dialogue and constant reminder of this is nothing but a love triangle between two guys and girl.
0.625 Breaking Dawn - Part 2 isn't the best Twilight Saga movie, but it does contain the best Twilight battle.
0.6 Wow, is it fun.
0.6 Final Twilight focuses on Edward and Bella's legacy.
0.6 Unintentionally humorous exchanges and awkward visuals undercut the quality of the filmmaking - but the final movie delivers a solid conclusion for its intended audience.
0.5 You're going to hear a lot about Breaking Dawn Part 2 being the best of the Twilight movies. That's like saying a simple head cold is preferable to swine flu.
0.4 The Twilight Saga signs off on something of a whimper with Breaking Dawn - Part 2, despite the best intentions of those involved to bring some extra punch and spectacle to Stephenie Meyer's source novel.
0.4 (It all) adds up to a movie of limited pleasures and lengthy miseries... and when combined with Part 1, it's an endurance test that few outside the faithful could even pass.
0.5 The prologue picks up where the nutty "Part I" left off, but that's about it for the next hour and a half.
0.2 A tepid end to a tepid saga. The CGI is bad enough that you'd think this came from the mid-nineties.
0.4 The 'Twilight Saga' has no upmarket aspirations. Seeking neither critical applause or peer-review awards, these movies, like those of Tyler Perry, seek only to provide unabashed satisfaction to those who believe in their characters.
0.7 With a flurry of bonkers action and cross-species bonding, The Twilight Saga surges to a howling conclusion that has more attitude in it than all four previous films put together.
0.375 Will Chris Hansen and the Dateline NBC team burst out of the woods to catch that predator Jacob?
0.6 The fifth and final instalment of the Twilight saga has the best climax of any blockbuster this year.
0.5 The finale is a doozy, almost certain to be satisfying to fans and impressive even to the casual "Twilight" viewer. But so much of what comes before that payoff...is mundane, dull, all talk and no action.
0.6 A riotous showdown ... finds an absurdly ingenious way both to preserve and subvert the contentiously passive climax of Meyer's novel.
0.75 Finally, there is something we can all agree on: Twilight is awesome. Trust me, I'm shrieking on the inside.
0.375 I'm not sure why I even bother to review these movies. TWILIGHT fans are going to see these regardless of what I think. They're going to like BREAKING DAWN part 2, just because it's TWILIGHT. They're blinded.
1.05 The opening section of the movie has the air of a 1980s shampoo commercial as the two newlyweds... make passionate love to a nonstop music track.
0.6 A tortura chegou ao fim.
0.625 Ironically, Kristen Stewart shows more life and spark dead than she did alive in four previous movies as the vapid Bella.
0.625 [The end credits are] a chance for "Twilight" fans to say goodbye to their favorites, and a chance for everyone else to delight in the knowledge that this consistently underwhelming saga is at long last over.
0.75 A finale that both rewards longtime fans with the most satisfying conclusion possible while providing a spectacular main event style brawl for action junkies.
0.25 It's a movie so dull you might start yanking on your own head after about an hour.
0.5 The series as a whole has steadily lowered the level of expectations to the point where 'less bad' has become 'good.'
0.4 Other than the Bram Stoker meets "Braveheart" battle, this vessel offers very little to make our collective blood race.
0.625 After the laborious exposition of "Part 1," "Part 2" is able to reap the benefits, tying together some disparate threads and providing real action at the end.
0.1 Unequivocally the worst of the lot ... The final instalment of a five-film franchise has all the emotional weight and impact of an episode of Entourage.
0.6 Breaking Dawn - Part 2 offers a very efficient, mildly touching, morally unimpeachable conclusion to a chronicle that has left an indelible impact on contemporary popular culture.
0.625 The first "Twilight" film that could get non-fans' hearts pumping turns out to be the last.
0.5 Fans of the series, which has made more than $2 billion worldwide, will no doubt find it all terribly romantic and deeply meaningful. The rest of humanity will remain unmoved.
0.6 Despite the slow start Mr. Condon closes the series in fine, smooth style. He gives fans all the lovely flowers, conditioned hair and lightly erotic, dreamy kisses they deserve.
0.625 It's an ending to a four-book and five-movie series that will keep those who have read the books on their toes but still satisfy as one of the more action-packed and exciting of the Twilight movies.
0.4 Breaking Dawn Part 2 is the best Twilight movie ever made. That doesn't mean it's good.
0.4 As billion-dollar Hollywood franchises go, this is one of the drawn-out dumbest. The stake through the heart comes not a moment too soon.
0.5 "Breaking Dawn, Part 2" doesn't end the series on an especially strong note, but it ends it. Let's count our blessings.
0.5 Full of pauses and intense looks and vague standing around ...
0.75 [Condon and Rosenberg] deviate from the original story created by Stephenie Meyer in a way that feels like a dance in the end zone.
0.7 Breaking Dawn - Part 2 will elicit laughs aplenty - but thankfully, they're all on purpose.
0.4 When the climactic battle finally arrives, it's a big letdown, full of bloodless decapitations (thanks, PG-13 rating) and awkward face-offs.
0.5 No rocket's red glare or bombs bursting in air for this Twilight's last gleaming.
0.4 Plays more like a bloated final hour of a better movie than an actually satisfying experience on its own terms.
0.4 The catering-ad backdrops, pouty nonperformances and cheap-looking effects still dominate.
0.375 With so many scenes of well-dressed vampires sitting or standing, stiffly, while Taylor Lautner or Robert Pattinson or Kristen Stewart passes another micro-slab of dialogue like a kidney stone, [Sheen's] overacting's greatly appreciated, thanks.
0.9 A satisfying and gratifying ending to the journey of Edward and Bella that summarizes all the lessons we've learned from them.
0.6 Director Bill Condon makes up for his rather lacklustre adaptation of the first half of Stephenie Meyer's concluding novel Breaking Dawn with a full-throated Part 2.
0.4 The final Twilight movie, bizarrely actionless for much of its length, may be the longest whimper in Rom-Goth history. Even the title weakens the will to live.
0.625 It's not a good film, but viewed from a cockeyed angle, it's a great guilty pleasure, and director Bill Condon is in on the joke.
0.625 Easily the trippiest and goofiest of the five addled adolescent vampire romances based on the Stephenie Meyer books ...
0.625 Immortality becomes Bella. After moping and mewing throughout the first four film adaptations of Stephenie Meyer's "Twilight" paranormal romance series, the heroine takes charge.
0.625 It's a fairly satisfying wrap-up to a not-very-satisfying series.
0.5 The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 is easily the best film in the series, thanks to stylish direction, a good sense of tone, and decent acting. It also has an infuriating ending that reinforces the worst of this series.
0.6 Director Bill Condon infuses the final entry with a refreshing balance of fun, vibrancy, action, humor and genuine emotion, making Part 2 the best of the bunch, by far.
0.375 As for you, dear reader, the symptoms of our long national nightmare should begin to fade as you're heading out of the theater, dissipating by the time you clear the concession stand.
0.625 Breaking Dawn - Part 2, the fifth and concluding chapter of the young vampire romance franchise, manages to find a pulse as it profitably clicks the turnstiles one last time.
0.6 A mainstream film designed for mass consumption that is quirky and personal and deeply felt.
0.5 Heavenly shades of night are falling: it's Twilight time...[for a series which] has always been borderline comical in its moments of greatest sincerity...
0.4 This is still a silly, unapologetically melodramatic - and at times unintentionally funny - teen soap opera, and one that is made for fans and only fans. Which I still am not.
0.6 It's not a terribly satisfactory capper to the Twilight franchise because it sets aside the strange undercurrents of desire and danger that defined the series and made it such a hair-tearing conundrum for feminists ...
0.5 This fifth and mercifully final installment features so much idle anticipation that it's unclear whether we're watching a movie or an Apple product launch.
0.625 Characters are better employed; emotions are, for once, palpable; and the selfishness of Bella, author Stephenie Meyer's avatar, is finally somewhat squelched.
0.5 The final shrug.
0.75 Rather than repeat past mistakes by handling author Stephenie Meyer's supernatural love story with kid gloves, this "Twilight" cuts loose and is as playful as a puppy.
0.6 So why does Hollywood forget the female audience when we need more heroines like Katniss Everdeen and Bella Swan? Is it simply that boys like the cinema more than girls? Well, Twilight blew the cobwebs off that movie myth.
0.6 The dialogue remains spotty and sappy, the effects still haven't caught up to modern-day standards, but "Twilight's" popularity is such that even when it falls short, it doesn't seem to matter.
0.5 This is a rousing climax to the series. But, if you hated it from the beginning, there is no reason here to change your mind.
0.625 The changes make for a visceral, satisfying climax. After the ups and downs of previous "Twilight" films, it's good to have the series quit while it's ahead.
0.625 Finally, someone took the source material at its terribly written word and stopped treating the whole affair so seriously.
0.5 Condon and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg aren't afraid to play fast and loose with Meyer's story, and that's a good thing. You just wish they'd done it more often.
0.4 Everyone's tying up loose ends, and demonstrating no particular enthusiasm about doing so.
0.4 Between its farcical script, soulless relationships and waxwork performances, this is a final chapter that will please only the most devout fans.
0.6 A lot more fun than the last few films and it does at least deliver a genuinely thrilling finale. Sort of.
0.6 Twilight fans will certainly enjoy BD2's faithful approach to the tricky-to-film source material and celebrate a triumphant ending to their beloved saga.
0.6 "Breaking Dawn, Part 2" expands with a full intensity of force, stronger and more epic than the films that led to this impactful finale.
0.625 I must admit if you're going to bring the series to a close, "Part 2" does it about as well as it can be done.
0.375 In the climactic sequence things finally start happening, as if they wanted to show the movie they could have made if they weren't stuck with such lifeless material.
0.375 The central question of this "saga" ... having been answered in the final seconds of the previous movie ... there simply is no longer any tension left.
0.625 On final assessment, "The Twilight Saga" has been one pop-cultural fad difficult to figure out the appeal of, but one thing is for sure: all involved saved the best for last.
0.8 The final film restores order and balance, with a firm grasp of what made the series exceptional in the first place.
0.4 After nearly two hours of padding, there's a laughable climactic battle sequence with heads shattering bloodlessly.
0.4 Aside from the impressive final showdown, Breaking Dawn - Part 2 feels like the dying breaths of a cash cow being milked dry.
0.6 Surprise: Twilight has discovered a fresh sense of danger and energy.
0.6 Bigger, better and bloodier than its predecessors...
0.6 Various character arcs are brought to a satisfying conclusion and there's a fun twist.
0.6 In terms of providing plenty of bang for one's buck, Breaking Dawn Part 2 definitely ends the franchise on a high note.
0.4 Heads roll, sparks fly, wolves howl and the cinema audience collapses, weak with laughter.
0.6 Fans will be left on a high; other viewers will be confused but generally entertained by a saga whose romance is matched only by its weirdness.
0.4 Despite all those fierce confrontations and tribal divisions, exhaustively rehearsed and mythologised, nobody's really a bad guy and nothing's really at stake.
0.6 Three fingers of supernatural teen romance served neat in a dirty glass with a sparkler and cocktail umbrella, and not a single concession is made to newcomers, or sanity.
0.6 Directed by Bill Condon, who helmed the last instalment, the film's an adequate end to the story but not much else.
0.8 Twilight Breaking Dawn: Part 2 really does stand up to be the epic conclusion that we were all waiting and hoping for
0.8 Every frame of silent, lip-biting, pent-up tension in the series has been holding its breath for this -- a 600-minute soap opera suddenly exploding into a Grindhouse slasher.
0.6 Somehow the final film has stuff to say about love, friendship and loyalty that works.
0.25 4 stars for bad-movie buffs, 1 star for the rest of humanity.
0.375 This is, without exaggeration, one of the single worst films ever made, which hasn't prevented it from becoming a cult classic.
0.0 Who knew this would be the pinnacle of Pia Zadora's career?
0.6 Adults may find it obvious and as square-cut as cheese. But let's face it. From now till you-know-when, the youngsters are all that matter.
0.5 White Christmas on a red planet, and not as bad as some people insist.
0.2 shot in that hopeless, bad filmmaking style ... with the delayed, artificial rhythm of a trans-Atlantic phone call
0.0 Low expectations met.
0.6 I can't help it I love it!
0.8 Classic Crap
0.2 The plot, such as it is, proves it is possible to insult the intelligence of a three-year-old.
0.4 Oz prequel has sweet message, cloying songs.
0.8 The final instalment, Deathly Hallows Part 2, is a bravura duel between good and evil. It's also a cathartic, occasionally clunky nostalgiafest.
0.75 Come the conclusion, tears no doubt will be shed, probably by those more devoted than I. Whether they cry because of overwhelming emotion or in mourning an era's end, I'm not sure. Probably both.
0.875 It's a bittersweet end as the final adaptation of the beloved books hits the big screen. Expect tears, both from nostalgia and some truly amazing storytelling.
0.8 For 10 years and eight films we've gotten to watch these young actors grow as people, as performers and as characters. It has been a true coming-of-age saga, in the fullest and most moving sense of the term.
0.75 The most enduring aspect of the Harry Potter films, and the reason this one works, is the acting of its three young leads.
0.6 It certainly went out making its presence felt, but in my opinion, though there were explosions aplenty, a few deaths, and everyone inevitably ended up with who they should, I felt it ended with more of a fizz than a bang.
0.6 The grand finish, if not always inspired, feels necessary. In a sustained, imaginative way, this is the best of any movie series.
0.5 Sadly, though, the finale isn't the spectacle the series really deserves, and I feel fans will gloss over the film's dull points and poor direction in favour of facing the reality that 'the Deathly Hallows Part 2' is an average affair.
0.6 As to the three principals, they've grown up with the Potter saga and have done so reasonably gracefully.
0.875 When the time comes to face Harry's fate, Radcliffe confidently, casually shows how much he's matured as an actor.
0.85 I for one am glad to see Harry Potter come to a close. It was one of the most reliable film franchises ever to go beyond a trilogy, even at its spottiest, and I imagine that an entire generation will look back on it with fond memories.
1.0 Yates strikes a beautiful harmony to make the most of the storytelling and the technology.
0.8 Thankfully, Yates gives us one wonderful final voyage with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, a smashing, melancholy, and thoroughly satisfying conclusion to the eight-film saga.
1.0 The seven films to date have earned almost a billion dollars each, so it's obvious their followers are legion. But this is also a series that takes itself seriously, never more so than in this, the deathly finale.
0.875 Radcliffe's interpretation of Harry has been exemplary, truly amazing when you think about it.
1.0 This enthralling film ends the series on a high note, exceeding expectations and delivering a fine conclusion to the films.
0.8 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a bittersweet parting for the Boy Who Lived, an excellent finale for the popular boy wizard who has captured the hearts of so many people.
0.625 Passable, well-acted, but not one of the best films of the series.
0.8 The movie ... manages to be a worthy ending to what has become one of the greatest film franchises ever released.
0.75 Part 2 ends up being a worthy note for this decade-long franchise to go out on with a satisfying conclusion to bid farewell to these enduring characters.
0.875 What truly unifies this ten-year, eight-film saga is the sense of kinship with its lead trio of young wizards.
0.8 Ending the light fantastic
0.8 A wonderfully rich adaptation of the final book's last act, but the central focus on the three leads might leave some fans disappointed, especially those seeking a more thorough adaptation.
0.7 For the most part, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II picks up right where Part I, the franchise's shining beacon on a hill, leaves off.
0.81 It all ends. And to be sure, it's a fitting end for the storied franchise.
0.625 Fiennes and Rickman get the actorly moments they've been building toward for so long, and the film is most fun when it sticks to mechanics: roller coaster rides, battle scenes, close calls.
0.875 For the most part, the final movie delivers the combination of emotional intensity and rousing battle sequences befitting the end of a phenomenon that evolved from an unexpectedly popular children's book series to an era unto itself.
1.0 While swept up in the desperate search for Horcruxes, Yates allows us to feel once more as though we are very much in the middle of things, but, alas, it was a trick and a false hope, because in the end...it was, irrevocably, THE END.
0.6 This is exactly what you would expect - a perfect and exciting ending for those who have been following the franchise. Those who couldn't care less probably stopped reading ages ago.
0.8 It makes a fitting conclusion to a series that most of the film-going public has been following for over a decade.
0.8 An emotional, have-a-hanky-handy experience for many viewers as characters they've come to know, love and care about make their collective exit.
0.875 Back in the first movie, Mr. Ollivander told a young Harry that we should expect great things from him. With the cinematic conclusion ten years later, he's been proven right.
0.7 The successful run of a franchise such as this is truly a rare feat in Hollywood. Take a bow, folks.
0.9 ...as the ads suggest, it really does all end here for both the genuine and stimulatingly fictitious kids who have grown up dealing with the fulfilling assortment of thrills... horrors, action and laughs so easily generated in the "Potter" movies,
0.8 a very substantial fantasy film, perhaps even beyond the level of one of the LORD OF THE RINGS films. With one major omission the series comes to a satisfying and frequently spectacular conclusion.
0.7 A fitting farewell for all the zillions of Harry Potter fans; not the best HP movie but one of the best.
0.6 ... Yates and company deserve credit for delivering the goods -- generally.
0.75 delivers precisely what most viewers will be looking for: battles, suspense, revelations, and, most importantly, a fitting, emotionally satisfying conclusion that is entirely in keeping with Rowling's novel.
0.875 The series now has the power to deserve comparison to The Lord of the Rings.
0.8 Ralph Fiennes is AWESOME in this movie.
0.8 If these movies have done nothing else, they have shown great skill in playing directly to a target audience, never swaying from that mission, and doing it exceptionally well.
1.0 ... a brilliant finish to the series, an action-packed finale with elements of darkness and beautifully integrated moments of humor and heroism.
0.6 Como cierre de la franquicia seguramente no decepcione a casi nadie. No hace falta ser un gran fanatico para esperar esta culminacion con ansiedad, e incluso para emocionarse.
0.8 This is a massive, tentpole, franchise movie with impeccable good taste -- its most essential, surprising and exhilarating ingredient.
0.9 I think what works best about this final film is how surprisingly moving parts of it are.
0.6 The Harry Potter movies aren't really movies. They're the world's most expensive book illustrations.
0.75 The messianic aspect of Harry's purpose-driven life comes to the fore... making this an action-packed, adventure-laden rewrite of the Easter story...
0.9 This Harry has something the others don't -- the power of goodbye. That helps this film be the best of the series.
0.9 This HP 7.2 makes a great case for lifting the entire third act out of a picture and just making that your sequel.
1.0 The magic isn't over. Far from it.
0.9 For a grand finale to a truly epic, good-natured franchise, this is a perfect goodbye that's very hard to beat.
0.9 Unlike nearly every adaptation Hollywood produces, the Harry Potter films, taken individually or as a whole, are worthy-epically worthy-of their literary source material.
1.0 It's the perfect conclusion to a wonderful, decade-long love affair with Harry Potter.
0.9 The filmmakers thankfully remember that we've journeyed so far with these characters and so they trust that we, the audience, will understand the poignancy and meaning of the events that are unfolding.
0.9 While 'Deathly Hallows: Part 2' brings closure to the sprawling saga, the primary reason to see the film is because it's entertaining.
0.875 With nothing left to tell, the grand finale to the Harry Potter saga holds nothing back.
0.9 One of the best of the eight films Deathly Hallows: Part 2 might indeed require a scorecard for the uninitiated, but for those in the know, it's a more than suitable ending for a decade-long journey that was truly magical.
0.8 begins with a bang and doesn't stop.
0.7 A satisfying roller coaster ride that Harry Potter fans have been waiting for since the beginning.
0.875 Sharply directed and appropriately tear-jerking, imbued with the gravitas of such an epic finale.
0.75 It's a bucket of maraschino cherries and whipped cream after no supper. It's a two-plus hour climax without an ounce of foreplay. A fireworks grand finale without a single sparkler cooling off in Uncle Joe's Pabst can.
0.75 More than ever, Radcliffe is asked to take control of the screen as his boy wizard faces his own demons before finally facing Voldemort, and the talented thespian is up to the task, holding nothing back in an ofttimes ferocious performance.
0.9 "A worthy conclusion to the series, providing numerous worthwhile payoffs to J.K. Rowling's wizard saga."
1.0 A fitting finale and bittersweet good-bye to the boy wizard who is no longer a boy.
0.9 If ever there was a critic-proof film, this is most certainly it - but, pleasingly, it's so good that it doesn't have to be.
0.875 Deathly Hallows - Part 2 is everything a Potter fanatic could want in a franchise capper.
0.75 ... a mostly satisfying coda, with nostalgic 360 return to Hogwarts ... Potter faithful will find a sizable lump in their throats as the music wells and intrepid threesome take their places in carefully staged tableaux.
0.875 Merely translating the events of the novel would have been easy, but Deathly Hallows Part 2 - like all its predecessors - invests the story with a cinematic life all its own.
0.875 The Potter universe, magical as it is, is more grounded in heart and soul than many fictions. You don't read Harry Potter to escape, you read Harry Potter to find your way.
0.7 Not the be-all and end-all of its series, nor of summer blockbusters... Think of it instead as the lingering farewell to a fun ride.
0.875 Thematically, like any good myth, the Harry Potter story comes full circle, with a heroic homecoming and the promise of more adventures, if only in our imaginations.
0.875 Director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves seem to be on the same page in building intensity and flawless execution. This concluding swan song goes out with a bang rather than a whimper. There were no dull spots that dragged the story down like...
0.9 One of the most faithful adaptations of any source material I have seen, in this series or outside of it... If only Hollywood would make more movies like this.
0.5 [It] bungles key moments that have built-in dramatic weight from the book with ordinary staging and a breakneck pace. Many of the movies, including this one, have merely summarized the books rather than actually interpreting them.
0.9 In the end, it's the incredible inventiveness of Rowling's concept that makes it a can't-put-down book series with a not-to-be-missed movie series following closely behind.
0.8 Harry Potter isn't about the wand choosing the wizard; it's about what education should be about: transforming imagination into reality.
0.875 Satisfying
1.0 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 caps the series with visual panache and emotional punch. It's a fitting finale to an unparalleled cinematic accomplishment.
0.8 Ten years. Eight movies. Evil vanquished. It's done.
0.875 In the 10 years since Harry's first big- screen close-up, the spell has never been broken. And we Muggles have been made better for the magic.
0.9 As they say, all good things must come to an end. But in this instance, you can take solace in knowing the fat lady can belt out one heck of a final note. Thanks for the memories, Harry Potter. We'll miss you.
0.95 Fantastic! Emotional! Its a full blown out war!
1.0 Spectacularly epic, poignant end to a magical series.
0.875 "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" ends the series on a triumphant note. It is a memorable and moving conclusion that will leave you wishing for more.
0.875 The film expertly balances physical action and emotional development, loud moments and quiet ones, and it's that balance that makes it such a satisfying and proper finish.
1.0 The greatest Potter film of them all.
0.8 The Potter films have gotten darker, both literally and figuratively, with each installment, and the predominant tones of Deathly Hallows Part 2 are grey and black.
0.8 In Deathly Hallows Part 2 Radcliffe shows us the man Harry's been forced to become. It's a real performance, layered and even moving.
0.8 A fitting final chapter.
0.6 Not that part two of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is bad, you understand; it's much better than I expected, given the mediocrity of the series in general and the fizzle of part one in particular.
1.0 This incredibly satisfying and emotionally moving finale is frosted with sprinkles of just about every bit of Harry Potter lore you can think to name.
0.75 It's a solid capper for this monumental series.
0.75 It's so detailed and mature that there's really nothing left for us to do but put down our round spectacles and our wands and return to our far less fascinating Muggle existence.
0.8 There's no doubt about it: Harry Potter ends on a high.
0.8 The finale is a great British triumph, twice as good as its predecessor, highly recommended. A happy ending, as I think it's known.
0.8 There's not much to say about this movie. If you've read the books, you'll go and see it and love it. If you've seen all the other films, you'll go and see it and love it.
0.8 An exciting, appropriately epic and emotionally satisfying finish.
0.9 ...the greatest showdown between good and evil since Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader mixed it up in "Return of the Jedi."
0.875 It's been a rocky road, but this final stop is among the series' best entries.
0.875 End of an extensive journey, hauling a weight of finality that's bittersweet. Still, there's much to celebrate here, with the picture a stirring, magnificent conclusion to a marathon wizarding odyssey.
0.8 An unbelievably satisfying bookend that is not only Yates' finest entry yet, but one of the best films in the series.
0.8 This Potter movie is the greatest, a fantastic end to a monumental series.
0.75 By staying true to the book's themes, fans immersed in Rowling's world will be more than satisfied, and should be advised to bring a tissue.
0.7 It's hard to imagine fans leaving the final Potter film with deep disappointment in this satisfying conclusion.
0.8 So long, Harry. It's been magic.
0.8 Will bring both chills to the skin and tears to the eyes.
0.8 This is pretty much a delight from start to finish that will thrill and touch audiences and leave them wanting more even as it concludes everything in an extremely satisfying and graceful manner.
1.0 The final chapter ends with an epilogue that puts a lump in your throat and makes you want to watch them all again from the beginning. That's the definition of a classic.
1.0 A fitting, shocking, exciting, mind blowing experience even the haters and contrarians will begrudgingly admit is pretty awesome.
0.6 Offers up exciting action set pieces and a rousing finale to the somewhat overlong series.
0.8 Watched as a stand-alone film it's likely to strike newcomers as completely mystifying, but committed and even semi-committed fans will surely welcome it as a worthy climax to the most successful film franchise in history.
0.75 [Ends] the series on an action-packed and character-driven note that works on most levels.
0.6 I can merely pay illiterate, honest homage to the costumes, special effects and set designs, which are all fantastic. And to the actors, hamming and over-egging as if it is All Day Breakfast season on Mount Thespis.
0.8 That both the beloved characters and the film series itself manage to emerge victorious from the fray after over 10 years is truly something to celebrate.
0.8 after ten years, eight films, and close to 20 hours of engaging storytelling, Harry Potter's cinematic saga is finally complete -- and the last act is just as compelling, if not more so, than the first
1.0 The final film has been labeled the 'epic conclusion' and I was elated to discover that it didn't disappoint.
0.75 It works its own kind of magic, the kind that comes from a great story, well told.
1.0 This is a terrific, smartly designed adolescent adventure, visually rich, narratively satisfying, and bound to resonate for years to come.
0.7 Part 2 is never not good, but that's small comfort when anticipating greatness.
0.8 Less committed filmgoers probably won't be quite as enthused -- Potter has long been a franchise constructed to please readers of the books first -- but should be sufficiently entertained nonetheless.
0.8 The final installment of Harry Potter's journey into spiritual maturity as a selfless magician who is willing to sacrifice himself for others.
0.8 It hardly matters that Deathly Hallows Part 2 is neither the best film of the series, nor the perfect conclusion to it. It's what it represents that's significant. And that's the end of an era.
1.0 A dazzling, stirring capper to a once-in-a-generation movie franchise.
0.9 Harry Potter's epic journey ends with power and majesty. For 10 years, we've waded through oceans of exposition and endured ever-burgeoning layers of new characters and mythology to absorb. All building to: This.
0.6 How do you compete with young Harry, young Ron, and young Hermione? You can't. They're ones of a kind. Good night sweet princes and princess.
1.0 The technical wizardry on display is perfectly crafted and fires the imagination like never before.
0.8 The eight-part saga comes to a close with an action-packed finale that neatly ties up the strands of the whole series and also manages to give its actors some meaty scenes to play with.
0.9 Everything comes together; the Chamber of Secrets, the basilisk venom, Parseltongue, polyjuice potion, the castle ghosts... there's no fat here.
0.8 So the wait was worth it. The eighth film of the seven-book series sees Harry Potter finally waving a wand in anger at his nemesis Lord Voldemort, and is not a disappointment.
0.875 Ten years and eight films after the boy wand-twirler's cinematic adventures began, the saga resolves in ways suspenseful, romantic and thrilling.
0.875 Exactly what it needs to be: artfully filmed, tautly paced, just sentimental enough.
0.8 As a standalone film, it delivers intense and engaging action. Though, I couldn't help but feel a bit underwhelmed by the final battle sequence we have waited ten years to see.
1.0 A truly magical finale.
0.875 The best was saved for last.
0.875 It has been extraordinarily fun, and now the decade-long saga has reached its grand finale. The best has been saved for the last.
1.0 The continuous flow of the two movies will hopefully be molded into a single 4-hour plus experience on Blu-ray (where Eduardo Serra's cinematography will really pop) and solidify its place as one of the best final chapters of any movie franchise ever.
0.8 David Yates and his crew have hauled Harry Potter and friends out of the vale of depression where they languished during the previous film and pitched them into an exhilarating series of cliffhangers.
0.75 With its heartening final note of hope and renewal, Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 provides an altogether fitting finale to a series that has prized the fans above all.
1.0 Well done, Harry! You've saved the best for last.
1.0 Tears are shed for the lost, cheers are raised for the (often unexpectedly) brave and noble, and, in the movie's final moments, there is a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment rarely achieved in filmmaking.
0.875 It's virtually non-stop action, though director David Yates, who has taken good care of these final four, ever-meaner Potter adventures, does a very crafty thing, following adapter Steve Kloves' screenplay.
0.875 This movie is impressively staged, the dialogue is given proper weight and not hurried through, there are surprises which, in hindsight, seem fair enough, and "Harry Potter" now possesses an end that befits the most profitable series in movie history.
1.0 A finale that's as moving, spectacular and engaging for both die-hards and casual fans alike.
1.0 Director David Yates has finally found an ideal combination of exposition and emotion in his fourth consecutive Potter project. Writer Steve Kloves... neither wastes a word nor leaves out any essentials.
1.0 This is a masterful and worthy final chapter in one of the best franchises ever put to film.
0.8 J.K. Rowling's boy wizard gets a spectacular, yet not entirely satisfying finale.
0.875 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 puts a triumphant capper on a decade of Pottermania.
0.875 It's almost impossible for the convergence of good and evil to meet inflated expectations. What matters here is that the story is told clearly and with faithfulness to the book, and that it resolves a conflict that has simmered for a decade.
0.9 Director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves guide the story to a graceful and satisfying end. The movie's final moments are the equivalent of the half-jubilant, half-mournful thrill you get when you close the cover of a book you've savored.
0.875 A satisfying wrap-up of the series, with an especially effective performance by Alan Rickman.
0.875 Some will complain that the film doesn't explain anything, blithely assuming you've read the books, and simply plows ahead. Good.
0.875 The movie puts a spell on you.
0.8 Ao longo de uma decada, a serie Harry Potter transportou criancas de 5 a 90 anos de idade em uma viagem intensa, imaginativa, envolvente, tocante, divertida, inteligente e deliciosa.
0.8 Even if you're not a big fan of the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 a mixture of solid storytelling and excellent craftsmanship make it--maybe not a new bar for adventure filmmaking--but a worthy entry and conclusion.
1.0 What a way to go out.
0.8 Pretty much an open goal given the inevitable payoff that concluding a story some seven films in the making was always going to bring, director David Yates though has helmed a very impressive film, and the best of the whole series.
0.75 ...good enough, which is a succinct way of describing the eight-movie franchise as a whole.
0.5 Epic battle? Please. Director David Yates moves at only two speeds: Super-charged yet not impactful and labored, faux-majestic stillness.
0.875 A fitting, expertly made final chapter, freighted with hard-won emotions, shot through with a sense of farewell, and fully aware of the epic stakes involved.
0.875 Be sure to arrive at your seat with plenty of popcorn -- and tissues. You're going to need both.
0.75 What fun to feel like a kid again. I had a marvelous time.
0.7 Casual fans of the film series will find this final outing extremely satisfying while the more serious fans are going to absolutely love it.
0.75 If you don't know what a Horcrux is, then you're at the wrong movie.
0.7 One of the saga's richest in character development installments, nicely rounds up the story without straying from its first half's tone and look, other than the uneventful and at times problematic use of 3D
0.75 Radcliffe's Potter is an abominable creation, capturing the dogged determination of Jason Voorhees, ability to infiltrate the hero's mind of Freddie Krueger and penchant for casual animal cruelty of Dora the Explorer.
0.875 Every bit as rewarding - and flawed - as its source material, this final installment of the Harry Potter series is pure movie magic.
1.0 The final Harry Potter movie, above all others, supplies Radcliffe with the gravitas of not just an epic story come to completion, but some real dramatic heft. Not so bad for a Hogwarts dropout.
1.0 Part II gets everything right to send off Harry on a cinematic high.
0.875 We'll miss you, Harry. But oh, what a way to go out.
1.0 The fast-paced, spectacular conclusion ties the final knot in the narrative thread of this spellbinding series.
0.8 It may not contain many of the series' most comic, surprising or quotable moments, but it does succeed in bidding adieu in fine fashion to some of this century's most popular fictional characters.
0.8 While it's unfolding, this is just terrific fun: eye-scorching, ear-battering, heart-pounding cinema of pure spectacle.
0.8 It's with a heavy heart that we say good-bye to Harry Potter, but in crafting what may well be the best blockbuster of the season, the boy wizard has gone out with a suitably spellbinding bang, and one that will leave a lasting impression on cinemagoers.
0.8 It's wonderful. Epic and heartbreaking and just as grand as it needs to be.
0.7 The film's subdued dramatic finale - resonant as it is with themes of sacrifice, the responsibilities of power, friendship, hard-won wisdom - easily ranks as one of the most memorable and moving in recent franchise movie history.
0.8 It's a great sense of hope and affection that you're left with in the end, regardless of J.K. Rowling's recent hints of an eight book on the cards ... As for the 3D, it adds very little
1.0 Everything a summer blockbuster should be but rarely is - a whip-smart, slam-bang piece of entertainment where we deeply care about the fate of the central characters (and many subsidiary ones who return for their last bows).
0.8 With shifting loyalties, unlikely heroes, truths revealed and a little help from friends, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" winds the series up in a most-satisfying fashion.
0.9 Represents big budget filmmaking at its finest and long-form storytelling at its most emotionally rewarding.
0.9 A triumphant, spell-binding finale for the Hogwarts wizards.
0.8 Harry is, and always was, The Boy Who Lived, and these books and films were about him coming to terms with the enormous obligations of that title, and realising that the burden of life is carried by all.
0.8 In the end the thing works like, well, magic...
0.9 An abbreviated, yet exhilarating finale that is equally satisfying as it is bittersweet.
0.95 To say they've saved the best for last would be an understatement. It's a finale that's truly magical in every way, and easily the best Harry Potter movie yet.
0.8 Deathly Hallows Part 2 isn't just a proper sendoff, but maybe the best argument for adapting these books to film in the first place.
1.0 A fitting capstone on a fabled film franchise for the ages!
0.875 While "Deathly Hallows: Part 2" offers long-promised answers, it also dares to pose some eternal questions, and it'll stay with you after the final chapter has closed.
0.8 Delivers the action-packed finale fans have been hoping for and the required emotional kick, even if it can't quite convincingly pull off the various romantic couplings.
0.8 Set pieces so spectacular you'll sit in awe at what the British film industry can achieve these days
0.8 Bear with the slow start and what you get in this bookending instalment's latter two acts is more pathos, exhilaration, and sheer entertainment value than anything else in the entire eight-film, ten-year saga. Potter has certainly saved the best for last.
0.8 Love, loss, courage, hope and humour -- Deathly Hallows offers them all in what proves a worthy finale to the Potter saga.
0.8 It's Harry Potter as a full-tilt action picture, yet unlike the mind-numbing action of Transformers, here you feel totally invested in the protagonists' plight.
0.8 A worthy farewell that packs in as much action as its seven predecessors combined and manages not to stint on the emotional beats. Harry Potter leaves us as a quiet, bespectacled, corduroy-wearing hero for the ages.
0.8 All too soon, in the words of the tagline, 'It All Ends'. Spectacularly. Emotionally. And Wanderfully.
0.8 Of course, if the films haven't won you over by this point, this one is unlikely to make you a convert, but for the millions of fans who've grown up with Potter, it's good enough to make saying goodbye a tougher proposition.
0.8 It's a rare film that manages to be both spectacular and sweet.
0.8 Fusing spectacle and emotion into a thrilling final chapter, director David Yates ensures that the series goes out with a bang. Finales don't come much grander than this.
0.8 This is such an entertaining, beguiling, charming and exciting picture. It reminded me of the thrill I felt on seeing the very first one, 10 years ago.
0.8 The entire series of Potter books and motion pictures has been leading us to this final showdown between Harry and Voldemort. It could easily have been a letdown. But the fight here between good and evil is more than satisfying. It's thrilling.
0.8 You need a deep grounding in Potter-lore to make the slightest bit of sense out of it, but that won't be a problem for most people who see this film.
0.0 Here's a 'Christian movie' that's an embarrassment to a genre that doesn't exactly have a reputation for producing great art.
0.5 The first half of The Visitation moves slowly and surely, building an appropriate level of edgy suspense before disintegrating into standard horror-flick cliches.
0.5 You could rent it for the religion, the kooky cast, or for the B-movie fun of it.
0.4 It's one of those movies that looks like it was a gas to make. To watch, though? Not so much.
0.75 When the cast and their director are really cooking, they conjure a bipolar sense of high school-age emotion -- and use it to fuel outrageous fantasy.
0.8 Spider-Man is an effortless, intelligent entertainment, and a fabulous, fun-filled start to the hugely lucrative franchise.
0.8 Full of swinging action but finding plenty of time to explore the people behind the masks, Spider-Man is a franchise with real legs. At last, a blockbuster that lives up to the hype.
0.9 Captures the high-energy, pulpy effervescence of Marvel when it was young and feisty... whatever imperfections the film picks up along the way, they practically demand to be hand-waved aside.
0.8 It's got all that you'd want from superhero movie and more. A truly enjoyable film.
0.8 Fun movie, but may be too intense for younger kids.
0.8 Spider-Man is funny, poignant and true to form with Tobey Maguire and company fleshing out the famed comic-book characters with aplomb.
0.875 Finally, a fully faithful adaptation to a comic book icon, save for some bumps along the road. It's a fun movie.
0.7 A vibrant piece of pop entertainment that serves as the perfect start to the summer season.
0.8 An adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero adventures that effectively takes time between exhilarating digital effects to develop character and motivation.
1.0 Colourful, energetic and well-cast, Spider-Man is a good-quality, highly-entertaining action movie.
0.875 Spider-man flows as smoothly from scene to scene, catching the audience in its charming web and setting us up for a sequel which, for once, will be welcome.
0.8 Practically pitch-perfect summer entertainment.
0.875 At its best, it's action packed fantasy, grounded in reality by a talented cast who pack a real emotional wallop. At its worst, it's over the top, and more than a little sappy.
0.75 Director Sam Raimi was right. Tobey Maguire was the right choice for Spider-Man.
0.875 cool
0.6 Will have any 12-year-old trying to perfect that trick of hoisting themselves up between walls using their legs.
1.0 The final sequence . . . will have you leaving the theater feeling both dizzy and giddy, and looking up at the top of the nearest building wishing you could shoot a web at it.
0.5 This is not a good movie, but a mediocre means of passing a few hours. It is a classic example of money and special effects diluting artistic vision and talent.
0.75 Weak visual effects, but the film is at least entertaining otherwise.
0.8 Screenwriter Koepp...successfully adapts his writing style to that of pulp comics, and director Raimi follows suit with the film's colorful and fantastic look.
0.6 For all its faults, Spider-Man is a good film, and you'll probably have a good time watching it.
0.9 Sam Raimi a reussi un tour de force: l'adaptation de bande dessinee la plus fidele a voir le jour au grand ecran.
1.0 Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire bring a hero to cinematic life with a fun, fast, action-packed blockbuster.
1.0 Terrifically entertaining blockbuster that, for once, gets everything right.
1.0 The movie swings, literally, with physical and emotional energy for all of its two hours.
0.75 Very few liberties are taken with the story, and the ones that are (such as Spidey's webbing ability envisioned as a genetic mutation) seem like improvements.
0.7 Thankfully, director Sam Raimi knows a little bit about exposing the cool in something that is irrevocably cheesy.
0.75 It's got appealing performers as the leads.
0.75 Si el siglo XXI necesita de heroes, el Hombre Arana parece haber llegado para quedarse.
0.875 Sam Raimi has created a picture so likable and true to the Marvel comic book that comparisons with the first Superman movie are inevitable.
1.0 Raimi and his team couldn't have done any better in bringing the story of Spider-Man to the big screen.
0.78 An accomplishment of co-belligerence. That is to say, the unnatural alliance of pyrotechnics and honest emotional catharsis team up to create quality entertainment... Alas, it's an entertainment that is not complete in its uprising.
0.85 A piece of vintage cinematic entertainment with a post-modernist twist
0.8 A wonderful surprise - a superhero action movie almost everyone can enjoy.
0.75 Enthralling, exciting, exhilarating.
0.9 They don't make action-adventure movies better than the often spectacular "Spider-Man," the most exciting film re-creation of a superhero since Christopher Reeve donned a red cape and blue tights in "Superman."
0.6 This is entertaining stuff, and Sam Raimi has spun a good yarn for the summer.
1.0 A review threatens to turn into a session of gushing because the film is that type of experience; watching it, I kept wanting to applaud.
1.0 Someday rational thought will return and I will realize "Spider-Man" does not rank among the milestones of cinema. But someday is not today. Today "Spider-Man" may as well be "Lawrence of Arabia," so delirious has it made this longtime fan.
0.875 a deeply human and often moving character story in addition to a rousing action-adventure fantasy
0.75 While director Sam Raimi's surefooted adaptation doesn't quite reach the upper echelon of superhero flicks, it mostly gets everything right.
0.8 A stylish, exciting, and ingenious thrill-ride.
0.75 ... Raimi delivers a first-rate entertainment for the summer crowd, slick as an extra-large popcorn with butter - and about as substantial - when he has all the ingredients for a truly exhilarating experience with a life beyond the multiplex.
0.9 Cuarenta anos de lectores y fans emergen detras de esta superproduccion y ninguno de ellos queda defraudado. La cinta es desde su estreno, un fenomeno mundial.
0.8 Putting a comic book geek in charge of your Marvel franchise proves to be a very good thing.
0.7 The comic book movie has developed its own cinematic language, Spider-Man possibly blooming into a series worthy of a rack in The Android's Dungeon.
0.3 The action is too repetitive (how many different ways can you swing between buildings). Spider-man just doesn't have enough tricks up his sleeves to sustain a two-hour movie.
0.75 ...one of the most exhilarating (and silly) screen adventures ever to be inspired by the pages of a Marvel comic.
0.75 "Spider-man is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer, and hopefully, sets the tone for a summer of good stuff. If you're a comic fan, you can't miss it. If you're not, you'll still have a good time."
0.8 Como nao simpatizar com um super-heroi que vai de onibus para o trabalho?
0.9 Raimi gives this unapologetic fluff a mind, a heart and a keen sense of fun.
0.75 Though not perfect, Spiderman is the most satisfying movie from a cartoon that anyone could hope for.
0.8 It has everything you'd really want in a popcorn movie: humor, action, romance, and a really hot redhead!!!
0.7 Fun and nimble.
0.7 Effectively brings to the screen an unforgettable superhero that swings back into contemporary times.
0.7 This is perhaps the most spot-on film adaptation of a comic book superhero yet.
1.0 Parents will thrill to see a childhood hero in a full live-action adventure, while a whole new generation gets their first taste of a hero too cool to ever go out of style.
0.9 Toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well; everything is delivered with such conviction that it's hard not to be carried away.
0.6 The film actually is excellent for the first two thirds.
1.0 Majestic entertainment, brought to life by a creative team that deserves a mountain of accolades for making, at least, the second best comic book adaptation in cinema history.
0.9 A top-notch movie...the epitome of an outstanding summer blockbuster.
0.75 You can tell the movie was made by people who enjoy the source material and have no fear of making it known.
0.875 Was it worth the wait? Absolutely.
0.7 More fun than I was expecting.
0.875 The movie shoots for, and usually achieves a sense of giddy exuberance, but it comes at the cost of suspense.
0.75 A weightless good time from the great Raimi, but it lacks a truly memorable villain to make it truly fly.
0.75 Spider-Man is best described as an origin film, laying the foundation for future sequels.
0.875 Do I smell franchise? Who doesn't?
0.75 Peter Parker pick of a pack of pulp protagonists
1.0 A tightly woven web of fun.
0.5 This captures neither the letter nor the spirit of the Spider-Man of comic book and cartoon fame
0.6 Raimi does know his genre.
0.5 Tobey Maguire is one of the only decent things about the film, and he is hampered by a completely and wholeheartedly adequate script.
0.875 A dazzling show-stopper that...is better than any of the Batman movies ever were.
0.875 ... the most faithful 4-color to film adaptation to date. And yes, it's amazing.
0.75 This is a pure popcorn movie -- the kind of film one can unabashedly enjoy for what it is.
0.78 Despite its many action scenes and should-have-been tense moments, the film packs very little excitement.
0.875 Not only does Spider-Man deliver, but I suspect it might deliver again and again.
1.0 The very best slam-bang, gee-whiz comic-book movie ever made.
0.5 It wasn't a terrible movie. Ah, but what went wrong? The filmmakers did not trust their audience.
0.875 Director Sam Raimi gives Marvel Comics' wall-crawling hero the cinematic treatment he has always deserved.
0.2 Leave this overblown Saturday Morning Cartoon where it belongs ... in the clearance bin at your local comic book store.
0.8 With disarmingly entertaining movies like this, dare I say, who needs big bad superhero movies?
0.9 An exuberance, a celebration, a hoot, a kick and a half.
0.8 A blockbuster with a heart and a brain.
0.75 In this age of soulless, FX-driven action franchises Raimi anachronistically emphasizes character development.
0.875 A movie that both thrills the eye and, in its over-the-top way, touches the heart.
0.65 Fun, but not in the same league as Superman.
0.5 The superhero part of the movie will leave audiences with a flat feeling.
0.75 High-crafted and amusing.
1.0 A model of what films like this should be like.
0.8 A cool comic-book movie with enough thrills for any kid and a haunting emotional depth missing in such predecessors as X-Men or any of the Batman films.
0.75 Raimi's effort is fun, funny, and filled with spectacular effects -- and about as good an imagining of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's web-slinging classic as one could expect.
0.8 This may not be the best four-color adventure ever lensed, but it's the most affectionate and faithful to its source.
0.75 It's still a comic book, but Maguire makes it a comic book with soul.
0.9 My spider sense says Spider-Man will be a deserving blockbuster hit.
0.8 A whiz-bang, action-packed fantasy with a genuine love story at its core.
0.7 An easy, breezy and pleasantly uncheesy spin through the universe of Marvel Comics' beloved wall-crawling web-head.
1.0 A flat-out fun film.
0.75 Exciting as it is tender and romantic, Raimi's Spider-Man looks like a movie that will please not only the Spider-Man converted but also the viewer who just wanders in.
0.875 The most 'fun' comic-book movie since the first two Superman films.
0.625 Plays like a sensitive 1980s-era John Hughes teen film ... interrupted by really tawdry special effects and hammy appearances by a cartoonish villain played by Willem Dafoe.
0.625 Feels like a bland, watered-down product of a corporate vision, designed primarily to be the safe, sadly responsible start of a summer movie franchise.
1.0 Well-acted, funny and exciting, Spider-Man is on par with the first Batman.
0.75 Raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings.
0.875 Raimi's film is actually closer in spirit to a coming-of-age story like "Almost Famous" than to a flashy noisy mess like "Batman and Robin".
0.625 The origin story is well told, and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books. It's in the action scenes that things fall apart.
1.0 Finally an awesome super hereo comic book adaptation worth all your bubblegum money!
0.75 A surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of Hollywood's comic-book adaptations.
0.875 This is a rare twisted crowd-pleaser for longtime fans as well as novices -- or for those that don't know an arachnid from an insect.
0.75 To its credit focuses mainly on the warm-hearted human tale of the innocent superhero in a hard world, rather than on visual dazzle.
0.875 Spider-Man is about growing strange hairs, getting a more mature body, and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units.
0.8 My Spidey sense says that Raimi will finally hit the A-list, Maguire will get some new respect, and this film is gonna make a whole lot of money.
0.7 This fast-paced entertainment is a surprisingly successful mix of spectacle and human-scale drama.
0.8 Raimi and writer David Koepp never lose the lighthearted comic-book sensibility.
0.75 This long-awaited screen adaptation of the Marvel super hero does not disappoint.
0.9 Raimi is one of the best filmmakers out there, especially when it comes to making dark, comic-booky stuff.
0.7 Though [Raimi's] Spider-Man marks time more than it needs to and is no more than sporadically exhilarating, it does enough things right to be a solid comic-book citizen.
0.7 The filmmakers have succeeded in rejuvenating the character while staying faithful to his roots.
0.75 [Raimi's] passion for his source material is evident in every frame of this big, light, endearingly square movie.
0.875 A big-budget fantasy film with exceptional acting and special effects.
0.5 I'll sum up my reaction in a word: Yawn.
0.75 Good show, Spidey: We knew you had it in you.
0.75 It's good fun that engages our heart.
0.75 Webmasterful. That's Tobey Maguire as angsty nerd Peter Parker and his arachnid alter ego Spider-Man.
0.8 A yarn that respects the Marvel version without becoming ensnared by it.
0.75 A good movie that would be a better one if it were 15 minutes shorter, and a great movie if it were a half-hour shorter.
0.875 That rare thing, an event movie that leaves you feeling chipper, entertained and sated rather than ripped-off.
0.875 Sam Raimi has set the bar unusually high for the rest of the summer film season with this exciting and exhilarating adventure.
0.625 ...with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum, I realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time. It's a trifle.
0.75 So is Spider-Man worthy of its massive hype? Not really, but it is a solidly entertaining popcorn flick.
0.75 Spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it, but "Spider-Man" certainly delivers the goods.
0.75 Raimi does right by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original creation via an old-fashioned comic book aesthetic.
0.75 Watch Tobey Maguire turn the Big Apple criminals into arachnophobes!
0.75 A strong first act and absolutely, inescapably gorgeous, skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing Spider-Man.
0.9 A wonderful moviegoing experience for people who love the comic and those who have no idea what 'Excelsior!' means.
0.8 If you're looking for an all-around good time at the movies, grab a friend, grab some popcorn...and see this movie!!
0.6 About as good as can be expected for an introductory superhero movie, but it would have been nice if it was better than expected.
1.0 A perfect summer popcorn movie with lots of great effects, enough action, plenty of laughs, lots of romance and a great deal of heart.
0.2 The almost total absence of anything that actually looks like a narrative is one of Left Behind's issues, but it's not, honestly, one of the biggest.
0.6 Mix of apocalyptic book series and the Bible.
0.4 These folks get eternity in heaven, while I'm stuck here watching the Left Behind trilogy. I'm calling my rabbi.
0.4 Atuacoes ridiculas em um filme absurdo.
0.0 Whoa.
0.0 The loosely scripted story is further burdened with clunky dialogue and performances, shoddy continuity, and, well, Kirk Cameron.
0.2 We're asked to buy Kirk Cameron as a hardcore journalist covering an international crisis in the Middle East?
0.125 The only thing "Left Behind" made me want to do was pray that it would soon be over.
0.5 Neither as bad you might fear nor as good as you might hope.
0.6 This picture's b-movie values probably play better on video than in theaters.
0.25 An exceedingly poorly made motion picture.
0.3 For all its intimations of fire and brimstone, the film isn't remotely frightening, and the high-school-level acting doesn't help.
0.66 Solid, unexceptional mix of thrills and human drama.
0.1 Whatever the central message, the movie's still a blundering cringefest, thanks to unintentionally laughable dialogue, hackneyed writing and uninspired direction.
0.6 The movie's script, acting, and production values are not up to the standards of mainstream Hollywood theatrical productions, but it is filmed with a lot of sincerity.
0.8 Deliriously silly!
0.125 The really frustrating thing about Tomatoes is the toothlessness of its satire.
0.2 Lousy movie with a catchy titles
0.3 Turned into a B movie classic based on its title alone.
0.5 I don't care if it's "so bad it's good" -- there's some seriously funny bits in this otherwise disposable cult flick.
1.0 You may have seen Middle Earth before. But you haven't been IN Middle Earth.Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' has made it possible for you to feel like you're surrounded by the astonishing environment created by J.R.R. Tolkien.
0.75 With the first film pushing three hours, purists will be pleased. Less die-hard audiences will find a lot of meandering set-up - albeit visually gorgeous meandering setup.
0.75 It rambles over hill and dale and mountain and field and forest and marsh and through cavern and catacomb and grotto and pothole...but will please the Tolkien faithful.
1.0 While the new scenes don't add much to the great film, the outstanding wealth of special features makes this one of the must-own Blu-rays of 2013.
0.8 The odd thing about the saying "too much of a good thing" is that it acknowledges the fact that, something, in general, is composed of an overabundance of excellence.
0.7 The Hobbit may not be as memorable as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's a mostly faithful adaptation that sticks to the same tones and themes of the source material.
1.0 It's a journey that any fan of Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings" Trilogy should enjoy.
0.5 Peter Jackson's return to Middle Earth feels familiar and unfulfilling.
0.8 If Jackson had focused simply on Bilbo's party and their attempts to get a proper homeland for the dwarves, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' would have been a leaner, more engaging tale.
0.8 An Unexpected Journey offers an unparalleled visual spectacle
0.625 a drag-down, mildly diverting entertainment
0.8 The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey had me with the dulcet melancholy of displaced Dwarves, yearning to be home.
0.8 Slower out of the gates than a three-legged donkey... but it gets better, and fans won't mind this slowburn beginning because, hey, it's Middle Earth.
0.9 ...a jaw-dropping visual carnival courtesy of Peter Jackson and company!
0.5 The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a story stretched too thin; dragged out by drudging slowness and obvious padding that its handful of thrilling action sequences can't improve.
0.76 Should more than satisfactorily scratch the itch of those who have waited many long years to see Middle Earth back on screen.
0.9 A marvel of filmmaking wizardry and engrossing adventure storytelling, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey marks another triumph by director Peter Jackson who once again takes J.R. Tolkien's words and brings them to life with skilful, passionate expertise.
0.6 THE Hobbit occupies that same awkward spot in popular cinema as the Twilight movies in terms of balancing good cinema against fan-service.
0.4 There is simply not enough story to justify the inordinate length...the enormous production effort is negated by [the] disastrous decision to shoot at 48 frames per second...This makes the entire enterprise look like the world's most expensive home video.
0.75 A vibrant vision but a long slog.
1.0 Like the sad, bug-eyed Gollum, moviegoers may not have realized how much they missed movies like this onscreen in the past several years.
0.75 The absolute highlight: the return of Andy Serkis, master of motion-capture performance, as the scary, disturbing, pathetic Gollum.
0.9 A wild and visually stunning quest through a fantasy world all done with the noble spirit of courage and goodwill.
0.75 For what it's worth, the first installment of The Hobbit hits all the right notes and delivers what will be expected of it
0.8 All in all I think of it as The Hobbit: A Better Than Expected Journey.
0.8 'The Hobbit' is another ambitious, gorgeous and faithful trip into JRR's writing - and because of this, it won't win any new fans if you had no patience ten years ago. For those who do, you'll definitely want to go there and back again.
0.8 An unexpectedly great start to the prequel to "LOTR"; Peter Jackson strikes again.
0.5 My biggest complaint about this latest adventure in Middle-earth is that it is three hours worth of set-up for the next movie.
0.79 Much as with LotR, the casting is a strength.
0.8 This first chapter of Peter Jackson's new Tolkien trilogy takes us back to the familiar settings and characters, inflating a simple journey into an epic adventure in the process.
0.4 Peter Jackson didn't particularly want to direct The Hobbit, and I didn't particularly want to be bored to tears, but there we both were, fulfilling what could only be described as some sort of cinematic murder-suicide pact.
0.75 Having now seen it twice, I favor the 2D/24p version over the 3D/48p one. But absent the format quibble, Jackson gives us a worthy start to a new trilogy.
0.6 Aqui e ali, ate sentimos o gosto do universo criado por Tolkien, mas para isso temos que devorar quilos e mais quilos da massa fermentada por um padeiro megalomaniaco que perdeu o controle sobre o que levara ao forno.
0.55 Jackson seems to be going through the motions of epic fantasy filmmaking.
0.4 In his desire to tell this story in the most comprehensive manner possible, Jackson seems to have forgotten one of cinema's most pleasurable tricks: the ability to cut to the chase.
0.6 This is a Hobbit cobbled together by an obsession with technological ingenuity at the expense of storytelling.
0.6 Full of stuff... all the way up to a bloated 169-minute running time. But stuff is not exactly the same thing as having a rich and complicated plot.
0.8 Simply, if you're a fan of the way Jackson has delivered Middle-earth to you in the past, then this is more of the same...
0.875 ... there's nothing to hate or fear here (unless you buy the super-chubby size soda). Welcome back, Middle Earth.
0.6 Visually it is sometimes amazing, but it is a large troll step down from the last trilogy.
0.875 Entertaining, but just when a good thing becomes too much of a good thing will vary from viewer to viewer.
0.4 Instead of simply adapting Tolkien's novel, Jackson has opted to use the story as a jumping off point for a convoluted prequel that threatens to do for Middle Earth what George Lucas's Star Wars prequels did for a galaxy far, far away.
0.75 Is the 48fps format a good thing? Not unless the title had been Days of Our Hobbits or As the Shire Turns. My advice, then, would be to see this fairly entertaining movie in 2-D or even regular 3-D and leave the 48fps nonsense by the wayside.
0.5 I prefer my movies to be more entertainment than ordeal.
0.3 'Well, that was the longest video game trailer I have ever seen. No, seriously, are you going to show the real film now?'
0.5 ...almost 3 hours watching this would seem to be beyond torture for a normal adult, despite the exceptional production values which comprise the only reason to see it.
0.8 Not all the scenes are necessary, and a great deal of the movie is set-up, with Jackson reveling in his own return to Middle Earth. But it's an enjoyable experience.
0.875 Happily, despite all the technical details, "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" is exciting, tantalizing and satisfying.
0.75 The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is like 90 minutes of flirting, an hour of foreplay, and no sex. In other words, it's fun, but not entirely satisfying.
0.8 Precisely what an adventure epic should be: huge, long, and lots of fun.
0.8 A few extemporaneous Lord of the Rings elements distract from The Hobbit storyline but Jackson has presented a captivating and exciting return to Middle-earth.
0.75 Despite some minor missteps, watching it feels like welcoming an old friend into your home. He may ramble a bit and slightly overstay his welcome, but hanging out with him reminds you of why you're friends in the first place.
0.875 A promising start.
0.625 To its own narrative detriment, "The Hobbit" works hard to lay the framework for what will follow. Certainly that's one way to set out on a trilogy, but it's surely not the best.
0.5 Nearly three hours, and the story has progressed only slightly. Nothing is short and sweet here, not even the identities. It's always Thorin, son of Theraflu, son of Thong, etc.
0.6 Tolkien tale isn't as great as LOTR, but better for tweens.
0.5 Jackson's risky creative choices have drained Bilbo Baggins' adventure of its magic.
0.75 Tolkein geeks rejoice
0.75 Fantasy fans hungry for a second breakfast of Tolkien-fueled fare can get their fill with this visually sumptuous feast.
0.5 Peter Jackson catches a nasty case of George Lucas-itis with his latest Middle earth saga.
0.5 There's no denying the majesty in Peter Jackson's visuals but he's taken a relatively slim children's book and stretched it beyond the limits.
0.5 ...has nearly as much going for it (Martin Freeman as Bilbo, much untampered-with Tolkien dialogue) as it does against it (that chintzy-looking 48 FPS speed, bloated screenplay).
0.5 Sad to say, "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" is a pale shadow trying to reach the sun on the strength of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy.
0.4 In his attempt to produce a definitive, enhanced-strength version of the text, Jackson has stripped away much of the fun, a great deal of the energy and most of the humour.
0.8 What it all comes down to is that if you in any way, shape or form enjoyed the "Lord of the Rings" movies then you must see "The Hobbit." Many happy returns.
0.2 Yet another battle-filled and self-indulgent film by Peter Jackson.
0.9 A minor flaw or two but assuming you don't spend all of your days barefoot like a Hobbit, the movie will knock your socks off.
0.5 The reason it's so hard to immerse yourself in the world of Middle Earth again isn't HOW Peter Jackson filmed "The Hobbit." It's WHAT he filmed.
0.8 A hugely enjoyable set-up for what looks set to be another thrilling trilogy.
0.6 Jackson has delivered plenty more of the big setpieces that fans loved in the trilogy, albeit at the cost of making The Hobbit far more imperial and epic than it needs to be.
0.6 It would be wrong to ignore the technical achievement that Jackson has pulled off yet again. But when said and done, "The Hobbit" feels more like a cinematic encyclopedia of Tolkein's mythical world rather than a trip to the movies.
0.8 THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is a visual feast with whimsy and charm.
0.625 The repeated iterations of fight, flight and respite here get wearing. Especially perhaps because, with Jackson's fetish for detail, they take more time to watch on screen than to read about.
0.375 "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" has finally arrived, not on wings of gossamer fancy but with a hairy-footed thud.
0.6 Hems and haws with only an occasional cinematic punch, making it a good, but very expected journey.
0.6 While the 48fps reads very much as "American soap opera" in the early scenes, it's quite effective in the rousing, vertigo-laced action sequences. Messy, but worth a look.
0.75 Moments of brilliance and moments of boredom
0.75 Those expecting THE HOBBIT to be on the same level as LORD OF THE RINGS are only setting themselves up for disappointment. But if you just go in expecting a fun adventure, you should be able to enjoy it. Just DON'T see it in the higher frame rate.
0.125 If this were Green Eggs and Ham, the film would stop at approximately the point at which you would not eat them with a fox.
0.75 Gets off to a decent start for this next trilogy, but it's not the epic, genre-redefining event of the one that preceded it.
0.625 The overgenerous running time is somewhat to the film's advantage, but there are warning signs that Jackson might be stretching the tale to its limit.
0.75 The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a lot like that beat up car you have sitting in the driveway. It doesn't always accelerate when it should, but once it gets going it's more reliable than anything.
0.75 The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey ... is clumsy where Tolkien's book is streamlined -- filling in the gaps where the novel is vague...
0.5 With approximately six more hours to go, it's tough not to shudder at the sheer lengths director Peter Jackson is about to go to stretch this story into paper-thin taffy.
0.75 If The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is any indicator of things to come, this trilogy could be every bit as wondrous and exciting as the one that preceded it.
0.25 If you loved the earlier films, these are moments you will hold on to, but they're very few, and they're not enough.
0.625 Part One of director Peter Jackson's planned film trilogy of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit forces audiences to run an obstacle course before the fun kicks in.
0.6 His first installment of The Hobbit, Tolkien's relatively slim precursor to the sprawling "Rings" saga, is a technically impressive but bloated adventure that makes you feel every one of its 169 minutes.
0.82 It may not be the story the book told in content and tone, but it's the story it had to be... plus 30 minutes.
0.75 Those early scenes in the Shire and the story of the loss of the dwarf kingdom establish character and purpose and give reason to hope and care that, like a talented sports team with a losing record, things can get only better.
0.4 A major disappointment that is about as difficult to swallow as the Denny's meals that are among the avalanche of commercial tie-ins that have accompanied its release.
0.75 The film is frequently gorgeous, technologically adventurous and eventually thrilling.
0.4 Tolkien's inventive, episodic tale of a modest homebody on a dangerous journey has been turned into an overscale and plodding spectacle.
0.8 The final sequence is an inspired little montage, with a Wagnerian flick in its scaly tail, setting up Hobbit 2. I can't wait. And I'm the one who didn't even want to go into Hobbit 1
0.5 Even at their eye-filling best, these sequences generate more spectacle than suspense.
0.6 Once the adventure is finally underway, and Martin Freeman's meek hero starts to come into his own, Jackson digs in and delivers an appropriately epic companion piece to his earlier trilogy.
0.625 By the third time someone hangs by his fingertips over a gaping void, or Gandalf shouts "Run!" so they can flee the latest CGI monstrosity, the Lonely Mountain seems far away indeed.
0.6 Once it gets going, it's actually quite fun.
0.5 This movie is about drawing things out as much as possible to make a snack-size story feel like a meal.
0.5 Seeing The Hobbit is like going to a timeshare presentation. First you have to sit through the boring stuff before you can take advantage of the spectacular benefits.
0.75 Jackson imposes a sense of grandeur but mostly loses Tolkien's sense of fun.
0.5 This is not about a reluctant hero drawing courage from some deep personal well. It's not about dread and danger. It's about visual effects.
0.375 "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" is not the worst film of the year, but it may be the most disappointing.
0.8 The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey looks like the start of another blockbuster trilogy.
0.7 Watching The Hobbit was an unexpected endurance test. Younger children will not last the pace, but plucky ten year olds with a couple of well timed toilet breaks will lap this up.
0.5 Rather than an epic continuation of Jackson's Middle-earth obsession, the film seems more like the work of a man driving around a multilevel parking garage without being able to find the exit.
0.5 A bloated, dull mess of a film that meanders when it should move and stumbles when it should run.
0.75 Get ready for a more heated debate than any election season. Is Peter Jackson's ambitious, overblown adaptation worth it, or is it a flagrant attempt to create a cash cow out of a children's book? The answer is yes.
0.4 If you're going to a see a nearly three-hour movie based on a fraction of a popular book, make it "Lincoln"
0.75 The film is worthy of both your attention and of the Tolkien legendarium in which Jackson, his actors and his Weta Workshop technical crew are so firmly situated.
0.75 At nearly three hours long, "An Unexpected Journey" has moments when the caravan seems both overstuffed and out of balance, but it's such a scenic trip that only a stubborn homebody could complain.
0.6 It is great to once more be whisked back to Tolkien's extraordinarily vivid world, but Jackson's overstuffed film proves that it is possible to get too much of a good thing.
0.4 To gaze upon the film, like Frodo staring into that prophetic magic orb, is to be shaken by a dark vision of cinema's future.
0.7 A delightfully fun trip back to Middle-earth, even if it fails to justify its overstuffed 160 minute runtime.
0.375 As entertaining as watching the last bits of ketchup drip out of the bottle.
0.625 Bloated...overlong. Even Shakespeare needs editing.
0.6 Features terrific performances, stunning action sequences and some state-of-the-art special effects, but it's also far too long ...
0.8 I'm here to vouch for Jackson, except for the length.
0.75 Though at two hours, 50 minutes it feels overstuffed, the first "Hobbit" film holds its own thanks to inspired acting and some jaw-dropping technical innovations.
0.625 When, in Jackson's film, someone describes a character's "love of gold" as having become "too fierce," you wonder if the warning might apply to "The Hobbit" in other ways.
0.6 Often entertaining, especially for those fans who loved The Lord of the Rings and have been waiting years to see more of Tolkien's Middle-earth onscreen.
0.4 Peter Jackson definitely knows what he's doing. He just didn't do it this time.
0.8 Does An Unexpected Journey do a satisfactory job bringing audiences back to Middle Earth? The answer is 'yes' - if not as resolutely as I may have hoped - and the film is absolutely worth seeing for this quality alone
0.625 [The] elements are in place again, but the story feels less substantial than the Lord of the Rings tales.
0.5 Solid and acceptable instead of soaring and exceptional, [and] unnecessarily hampered in its quest to reach the magical heights of the trilogy.
0.75 "...after seeing The Hobbit I couldn't wait to see it again - projected at 24 frames per second and without 3-D."
0.5 It all just takes so long.
0.7 I feel like the 48 frames per second took off a full half point of enjoyment, yet I proudly reclaim here as I confidently send movie lovers forth to see "The Hobbit" (in 24 frames, please!).
0.95 Regardless of the frames, dimensions, or goggles used to conjure it, "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" is an incredible ride and a triumphant return to Middle Earth.
0.75 There are people who claim to see no difference between 24 and 48 frame rates, and to them, I'd recommend an unexpected journey to the eye doctor.
0.75 "The Hobbit" becomes what it was originally meant to be - not a cut-from-the-same-cloth prequel, but its own, individual thing.
0.625 [A] dazzling, busy, fundamentally tedious movie ...
0.625 It's a shame to see Peter Jackson treading water when there are so many new cinematic horizons worth exploring.
0.7 I found that it provided a pretty convincingly immersive experience, and I look forward to the technology's evolution/refinement. Which I guess also means I look forward to the next two installments of the trilogy.
0.6 The decision to hit the 12A rating squarely on the head also means that several scenes, particularly those involving Radegast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) feel added more for their cuteness than content.
0.625 In a bit of irony, Bilbo Baggins says at the end of the movie: "I do believe the worst is behind us." We can only hope so.
0.8 The board is set, the pieces are moving and we're set up nicely for Jackson to tighten the noose with the love of second-act grit he displayed in The Two Towers.
0.6 The more dark it becomes, the more 'The Hobbit' becomes compelling as a story, and finds a fitting tone.
0.75 "The Hobbit" is an impressive first chapter.
0.8 Even though this installment is mostly a prelude, Jackson's eccentric mixture of low humor, earnest foreboding and digitally processed pageantry is consistently engaging and immersive.
0.75 Piles on enough eye candy and action sequences to please fans, plus more humor than the three "Rings" films - even if it only occasionally achieves the trio's grandeur.
0.5 If Peter Jackson couldn't tell this slight story in a single film there's no hope the other two in this prequel series will be any less bloated.
0.8 It's easy to spot the padding in this over-long, character-packed, bladder-testing, 162-minute first instalment. But there's still more than enough here to make it a worthy addition to the Oscar-laden fantasy series.
0.6 It's a promising start...but where it's going to in the two remaining movies is anybody's guess.
0.6 The Hobbit may be a different story to The Lord Of The Rings ... but there is really nothing all that unexpected about this journey.
0.4 While fans of J.R.R. Tolkien's novels and The Lord of the Rings movies will find plenty to enjoy and marvel over, non-believers may find themselves getting bored and bemused by the unnecessarily drawn-out story.
0.7 An Unexpected Journey is a bit ropey, excessive and padded in places, sure, but if that's the worst and the best is yet to come, then this could end up being another great trilogy.
0.6 It's not as good as I hoped, but it's also a lot better than I feared.
0.8 And we're back! Slam bang in Middle-earth as though the Lord of the Rings trilogy never went away, which it didn't.
0.75 An Unexpected Journey is a competent, entertaining effort but it neither enthralls nor amazes in the way its predecessors did.
1.0 ( ... )despite plenty of flaws, this new forerunner to JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is set to have merit on its own terms. It's the most exciting film of 2012. And it's a technological ground breaker, too...
0.8 The Hobbit plays younger and lighter than Fellowship and its follow-ups, but does right by the faithful and has a strength in Martin Freeman's Bilbo that may yet see this trilogy measure up to the last one. There is treasure here.
1.0 Peter Jackson returns to the Middle Earth he rendered so faithfully in Lord of the Rings, and it's never looked so glorious.
1.0 The real triumph of The Hobbit is that Peter Jackson leaves you wanting more.
0.7 A tighter hand (and one less film in the mix) may have helped this first film somewhat but there's no doubt that the first step taken on our journey with The Hobbit is an enjoyable and visually stunning one.
0.6 Jackson has made The Hobbit with brio and fun, and Martin Freeman is just right as Bilbo Baggins: he plays it with understatement and charm.
0.4 As a lover of cinema, Jackson's film bored me rigid; as a lover of Tolkien, it broke my heart.
0.8 Emotionally rewarding, imaginatively detailed and made with a genuine sense of joy, the first Hobbit chapter succeeds despite its structural and formatting mis-steps.
0.8 Peter Jackson triumphantly returns to Middle Earth with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. A folksy, beguiling adventure, we get to enjoy the splendor of the story and fantastic settings in a more whimsical experience.
0.7 Grandiose and visually spectacular, although the visual effects overwhelm the narrative.
0.8 An Unexpected Journey has so many pay-offs that most are likely to re-engage with the saga.
0.7 Not as immediately captivating as the LOTR trilogy, but it's still a return trip to Middle Earth that's well worth taking. Martin Freeman makes a perfect Bilbo, and Ian McKellen is superb (as always).
1.0 Peter Jackson's return to swords, sorcery and beards deserving of their own postcodes is fantasy how it ought to be.
0.6 This film is pure excess that's almost definitely motivated by studio greed, but it's light entertainment that will please fans, and Andy Serkis damn-near runs away with the film during his exemplary third-act appearance as Gollum.
0.625 Tolkien's brisk story of intrepid little hobbit Bilbo Baggins is drawn out and diluted by dispensable trimmings better left for DVD extras.
0.6 An Unexpected Journey may as well be The Phantom Menace and God help us all if the next two movies aren't better than this one.
0.79 Peter Jackson's fourth trip to Middle-earth can't quite recapture the greatness, emotional impact or charm of the LOTR films, but there's still much to enjoy about The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.
0.7 A fresh, free-spirited form of fantasy, Jackson's latest provides a younger generation with a stepping stone to his later films while serving the adult's who want more.
0.5 Unless your dreams are populated by denizens of Middle Earth, endless footage of them simply talking or walking is a lot less spectacular than Peter Jackson thinks it is.
0.8 For its occasional moments of excess and unhurried pace, An Unexpected Journey is proof that Jackson still has a knack for stories in this world.
0.4 Tolkien could invent names and languages, but he couldn't create a plot at gunpoint.
0.8 This film stands ably on its own, offering up generous piles of large scale fantasy underscored by genuine emotional heft and boundary-pushing visuals.
0.6 The movie itself is a lot of fun. And if you can separate yourself from the visual distraction, you'll find plenty to enjoy.
0.6 Neither as complex or grand as LOTR nor as accessible as Potter; still, if you can overlook the arch moralising, this is fine kids escapism.
0.8 Because it is a children's story about children it is occasionally a bit precious, but only occasionally. For the most part it is an extremely well-designed piece of fantasy that doesn't try to overwhelm the audience.
0.8 Timeless classic faithfully rendered.
0.6 A slow, cold first half is followed by a lively, sunny second half.
0.625 The bigger the scope gets, the less we really care.
0.625 Certainly a feast for the eyes; once the story moves to Narnia, the film is never dull to look at.
0.6 It's an enjoyable adaptation and good enough for us to welcome this new franchise.
0.75 My guess is that [it] will appeal to all of us in need of a jab of earnest, old-fashioned moralism to save the day
0.4 Aslan = Jesus. Now you don't have to buy a ticket.
0.875 ...an engaging and visually-stimulating adaptation of the first book of Lewis' immortal seven-part Narnia series.
1.0 .
0.625 There's something giddily entertaining about watching married beavers bickering--without the usual Disney attempt at cuteness.
1.0 Chronicles, with its wonderful sense of adventure and fast-paced storytelling, is among the best films of 2005.
0.6 The odds are quite good that you'd exit the movie theatre pretty much disappointed.
0.9 ...a fascinating, visually compelling, and totally engrossing rendering of a well-loved classic.
0.6 If the film has one outstanding characteristic, it is that it creates a genuinely palpable alternative universe, made all the more meaningful because it supposedly exists on the backside of our own.
0.6 Si uno esta dispuesto a atravesar el ropero de la imaginacion, Narnia puede ser una magnifica aventura llena de magia, emocion y fantasia.
0.75 The world of Narnia looks exactly as I had imagined it as a child.
0.625 This PG-rated movie feels safe and constricted in a way the story never does on the page. It leaves out the deep magic of a good movie, or a good sermon: the feeling that something vital is at stake.
0.75 ...effectively replicates the experience of reading Lewis' book.
0.75 The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a fable that captures a fully realized landscape of honor, love, sacrifice, betrayal and forgiveness
0.9 Brilliant child actors eomtionally sell an effects-heavy but seamless and true adaptation of the beloved book.
0.5 The film is unfortunately uneven, with great moments followed by not-so-great moments.
0.75 Viewers who enjoyed the LOTR threepeat should find similar compensations in this less ambitious undertaking.
0.6 Shooting in New Zealand is only one way in which this film mimics THE LORD OF THE RINGS. But somehow one never really cares much for the four children who generally just do the obvious.
0.6 All the CGI in the world can't distract you from the idea that it's all a little bit silly, a children's story that works better on the page.
0.75 Long may it roar.
0.4 Bloated, bland, boring stuff.
0.375 What movie would Jesus see this holiday season? God help us if it's The Chronicles of Narnia ... I'm surprised Mel Gibson wasn't hired to guest-direct the crucifixion scene.
0.4 A lackluster screen adaptation of Lewis' novel.
1.0 A wonderful excursion that's alive with the imagination of fantasy literature and in tune with the beating heart of family cinema.
0.625 Neither as clever as Harry Potter nor as epic as Lord of the Rings, but for the children's story it is, Narnia works.
0.9 It's easy to dispense with the religious undertones and simply have a grand time drinking in the adventure.
0.6 This and "The Polar Express," side by side at your multiplex for many Decembers to come.
0.7 The spectacle is worth seeing on the big screen and the story is timeless.
0.5 The central conflict lacks the depth needed to articulate what is truly at stake; the characters are inadequately developed; and the story is little more than a heavy-handed Christian allegory.
0.875 Behold the vision of Narnia!
0.75 A faithful and exultant rendering of the classic children's fable. Bring on Prince Caspian!
1.0 It is exciting, a bit scary, offers some touches of humor and brings home a positive message about family, trust and faith.
0.625 In some ways it is a very good picture, yet it also should have been better than it is...You can feel The Chronicles of Narnia trying too hard to be the Next Big Thing.
0.5 Leave it to the Bible to spoil a perfectly fine fantasy epic.
0.75 The special effects are phenomenal, looking amazingly authentic.
1.0 Narnia is a visually stunning, and very touching film for the family.
0.4 As a broadside across the bow of Lord Jackson and his rampaging WETAns, this is a puny shot. And I'm still hungry.
0.75 Narnia may thrill younger viewers but leave older ones wanting.
0.75 If The Lord of the Rings is a shot of whiskey, then The Chronicles of Narnia is a glass of milk.
0.9 It entertains on all levels with a skillful blending of story and incredible visual effects.
0.4 Ultimately, the story is too lazy.
0.7 It's not as good as its competitors, which in this day and age is hard to do.
0.8 The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is a rich and enjoyable cinematic treat.
0.8 The biggest disappointment is Liam Neeson's voicing of Aslan, which has all the warmth and command of a public information film.
0.7 "You'll believe a beaver can talk!
0.8 El mundo creado por el autor, es recreado aqui de forma soberbia y majestuosa.
0.4 Descrever este filme como um O Senhor dos Aneis para criancas acabaria sendo uma ofensa tanto para a trilogia comandada por Peter Jackson quanto para os espectadores infantis.
0.7 The kids are disastrous, except for Henley. Her irresistible crooked grin is a triumph over British dentistry. She makes Dakota Fanning look like a calculating android.
0.75 The climactic clash of zoological and mythological combatants is the stuff of my childhood fantasies made digitally simulated flesh: It's like 'Doctor Dolittle' as reimagined by Robert E. Howard.
0.75 For sheer entertainment value, and the painless imparting of values about family, loyalty and bravery, this lion in winter roars loudly.
0.75 It's a ripping yarn, full of narrow escapes, talking animals, marvelous sights and magical happenings that lead up to an epic battle between good and evil. The extensive CGI work is well used and the children are exceptionally well cast.
1.0 It's a work of profound ambition, and, in adapting it for the screen, the makers of The Chronicles of Narnia don't shy away from its demands.
0.8 The Chronicles of Narnia is off to an impressive start as another classic of myth and fable comes to entertaining life on the big screen.
0.625 Swinton and McAvoy, not to mention the legions of Lewis fans, deserved better than this. This is a not-so-promising start for what could become a classic series, given better scripts and more competent directors.
0.6 The hard-core may experience the thrill of recognition. But the rest of us can be forgiven a perfectly appropriate giggling fit.
0.75 Rarely has there been such a seamless blending of digital creations and live actors. ...a classy kick-off to what should be a highly rewarding series of fantasies.
0.75 It can be a good thing, St. Paul tells us, to put away childish things. But it is sometimes an even better thing to pick them up again.
0.8 I mean 'childlike' in the best sense, evoking a sense of awe and innocence in the face of challenges. This is art as well as entertainment and it operates at a sophisticated level.
0.75 As the rare offering that plays well to the entire family it's a welcome addition to this holiday season.
0.75 It's quite an array of fantastic visions that Adamson and the animators had to create, and the very scope and depth of their mission is impressive.
0.625 Adamson seems more comfortable with animated characters than real ones.
0.75 The result is mostly engaging, but rarely soars or sings with imagination, poetry, whimsy or the sort of surprise that can take your breath away.
0.75 It's a sturdy adaptation, and if The Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe doesn't capture the magic of C.S. Lewis' books, it comes a fair sight close to catching it.
0.7 Is, and was probably specifically designed, to be Lord of the Rings-Lite
0.75 To its credit and power, the film allows them a reach that exceeds any one religion's grasp.
0.5 One only wishes the movie had been rendered more artfully. The dialogue is impossibly clunky, the characters are completely one-dimensional, and the magic is all too mechanized to allow anyone over the age of 8 or 9 to believe in Narnia.
0.5 It's more yawn-inspiring than awe-inspiring, especially for those who haven't read the book.
1.0 What constant magic it works.
0.7 It's allegorical and imaginative, although literary subtlety is lost to the patently obvious.
0.75 The obvious comparison is to 'Lord of the Rings' -- but when Peter Jackson creates the most awe-inspiring battle scene since Kurosawa, the bar is too high for Andrew Adamson.
0.875 The Chronicles of Narnia so vividly captures the magic of the book that Harry Potter might just want to watch his back.
0.75 A loving interpretation of C.S. Lewis's beloved parable for children, and it's almost perfect in every detail.
1.0 Enchantment, adventure, sly humor, the beauty of the seasons, life lessons about responsibility, family and sacrifice all co-exist in this film in splendid harmony. The filmmakers have created a classic.
0.75 Adamson's touch is rather pedestrian, as if he didn't have the confidence to let Lewis' tale soar.
0.75 The filmmakers make many compromises in the name of epic scope and box office appeal, but they can't bend this story out of shape, and they have Tilda Swinton on hand to spank anyone who tries.
0.8 ...a pleasant and safe cinematic experience for the whole family.
0.6 4. Oreius and the rest of the centaurs break into a rousing rendition of "Day by Day" to motivate the troops.
0.75 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe fares much better in its smaller, quieter moments that test the mettle and morality of its young heroes
0.75 The Chronicles of Narnia does indeed capture a certain wondrous, fantastical imagination inspired by C.S. Lewis' literary classics. But the film unfortunately also suffers from Lord of the Rings envy.
0.875 Tilda Swinton... may be the scariest witch since Margaret Hamilton in The Wizard of Oz.
0.75 On balance, more of the movie works than doesn't, but this isn't 140 minutes of unqualified successes.
0.8 An extremely well-designed piece of fantasy that doesn't try to overwhelm the audience with a spiritual message, but is content to work on several levels.
0.6 Enjoyable adaptation that looks fantastic and stays remarkably faithful to the novel, though it wobbles occasionally during the emotional scenes.
0.8 There is no one better than Tilda Swinton to play the White Witch.
0.8 There's plenty to like.
0.6 The fantasy aspect is merely a vehicle for another purpose, [and] it underdevelops character motives as a result.
0.375 The Chronicles of Narnia proves, sometimes, talking animals are not funny. Sometimes, they are waging a holy war, and Santa Claus is giving kids weapons for Christmas.
0.625 By the end of Narnia, I felt like I was retaught a lesson I had long since learned instead of living the dream of a new discovery. Suitable in that there are clearly no small metaphors, only small movies about those metaphors.
0.6 Whenever it allows the whimsy of its source material to shine through, it takes on a pleasant life of its own.
0.4 There's no hideous beast or CGI landscape rendered here that can compare with what lurks in the mind of even the dullest, least imaginative child.
0.7 The Chronicles of Narnia is not a bad fantasy film. It's just not a great one.
0.8 This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source.
0.875 It achieves an overall epic sweep most movies don't even dare to attempt.
0.625 That's not to say this Wardrobe isn't worth climbing into. Only that along with the dollops of delight, a bit of disappointment awaits on the other side.
0.75 Grown-up children who remember our own travels in Narnia will find that many of the details resonate beautifully.
0.75 The Chronicles of Narnia is a faithful rendering of a magical tale that should hold adults' attention and delight young moviegoers.
0.75 A grandly successful fantasy. Practically flawless casting, bewitching storytelling and impressive visual effects bring the beautiful, troubled land of Narnia to life.
0.625 Overlong, poorly paced and woodenly acted.
1.0 A generation-spanning journey that feels both comfortingly familiar and excitingly original.
1.0 Andrew Adamson, the director of the Shrek movies, clearly feels great affection for the book and has taken pride in living up to the source.
0.5 Watching The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is like being told a terrific story by a so-so storyteller.
0.875 This Lion is king.
0.5 It tells Lewis' story, which has its share of sticky and ponderous aspects, in a predictable, visually cautious way. You keep waiting to be transported, yet in cinematic terms, the transportation never arrives.
0.625 Too much, too nice, too boring.
0.75 The effects in this movie are so skillful that the animals look about as real as any of the other characters.
0.875 This movie cannot be dismissed, like preachy 'Christian films,' as religious propaganda. ... It is best enjoyed as a symphonic and delightful fantasy.
0.75 Adamson ushers us into Narnia with an unexpected feel for realism and honest characterization, which works both for and against the film.
1.0 ...manages to at once unleash Lewis' grandiose fantasy and corral it.
0.5 Hoping for franchise success by visual association with other movies, no matter how great the mimicry, steals too much heart and spirit from this beloved children's classic.
0.625 Populated with talking beavers and mythological creatures that, cast in a Christian parable, should probably watch their asses.
0.6 This almost-epic adventure directed by Andrew Adamson ("Shrek") is nothing to cringe at even if it does have flaws.
0.75 Praise Aslan!
0.625 Lord of the Rings and Passion of the Christ in one movie. Narnia (the film) exceeds LOTR (the film) in character expression and depth, but drags some in pace.
0.75 Magical and marvelous ... cross between the story of Jesus and The Lord of the Rings.
0.4 A bloated, cumbersome, overlong misfire.
0.75 Though Adamson lacks Lewis' storytelling confidence...The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe still comes across as a quirkily diverting children's entertainment.
0.5 The film wishes it was Lord of the Rings. It's not. Where's the thrill that leaves you waiting for Prince Caspian? Nowhere.
0.875 for those children old enough to endure the violence, this is a masterpiece of fantasy literature come to life
0.8 Lewis' fantasy is beautifully realised in a vast array of colourful characters and majestic scenery.
0.8 The movie remains faithful to the book in both tone and imagery.
0.6 A brave attempt, if a little on the safe side.
0.8 It doesn't just live up to its source material, it surpasses it by finding nuances in the story that C.S. Lewis didn't.
0.6 A visually impressive adaptation of C. S. Lewis's classic tale, which unfortunately slights the forgiveness theme in favor of a big battle scene led by a not-very-Christlike Aslan the lion.
0.5 To say that it's all more than a bit simplistic and heavy-handed would be a severe understatement.
0.47 For a journey into a mystical land, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is oddly awkward and stale.
0.7 The filmmakers have gone for broke, combining spectacular imagery and rousing energy. Although it's perhaps a bit overdone.
0.75 After his splash with the hit animataion Shrek, Adamson makes an ambitious leap with his big-screen adaptation of Lewis' beloved book, a special-effects fare that succeeds in keeping its intimate family tale.
0.9375 Nothing short of wondrous!
1.0 Jaw-droppingly insane...a film that makes criticism moot.
0.2 Go on the Disney ride instead. It's over sooner.
0.45 Beautiful production design and bags of promise give way to disappointment in this family comedy.
0.75 A thunderstorm of mysterious origin traps the old mansion.
0.4 Regardless of all the ghosts, or maybe because of them, The Haunted Mansion is one lifeless, spiritless affair.
0.2 Eddie Murphy, fresh from a string of wearyingly bad performances in really horrible features, pulls The Haunted Mansion down around him with record-breaking speed
0.625 You wonder why you're willing to wait an hour-and-a-half to go on it for the umpteenth time.
0.2 Uma comedia de horror que nao assusta nem faz rir.
0.4 Comic thrillers are always risky, but this one lacks even a hint of badly needed black humour.
0.2 Mansion is as dead as the spirits who haunt its unspooktacular walls.
0.2 Hauntingly Bad.
0.125 ... essentially a soulless collection of episodic gags... only serves to hammer a few more nails into [Eddie Murphy's] career's coffin.
0.625 uses the ride's familiar visuals as a leaping-off point for the horror-comedy, which is at times delightfully silly and at other times depressingly thin
0.375 Manages to make even such surefire audience grabbers as a zombie attack exceedingly dull.
0.25 To paraphrase one of my favorite lines from one of my favorite films ("Little Big Man"): Sometimes the Magic Kingdom works, and sometimes it doesn't.
0.5 It's ironic that in 2003 we find Murphy playing a role that, for all intents and purposes, might have been done by Mantan Moreland 60 years ago -- only Mantan was funnier.
0.5 With The Haunted Mansion, Eddie Murphy continues in a long line of family film stinkers.
0.4 ...maladroit dans sa tentative d'allier rires et frissons, insatisfaisant sur tous les plans...
0.4 Feels like something that was churned out through a machine; Disney Live-Action Cheese By Committee.
0.4 Another Disney ride-turned-movie looks great ... and goes nowhere.
0.5 Following the plot of the ride, as well as littering the screen with beautiful visual homages big and small, the film has less wiggle room to really come alive on its own.
0.5 There's disappointingly little in its 99 minutes that's better than what the ride has been doing for years in 10.
0.5 Eddie Murphy does a sterile job as the film's star, but it is Jennifer Tilly who shines in this otherwise flat film.
0.75 The Haunted Mansion was made in the spirit of giving everyone in the family something to enjoy together. It's successful at that level.
0.3 Learn from the Evers family: The Haunted Mansion is not worth the detour.
0.5 ...a lame and transparent pseudo-amusing scarefest...has all the whimsy and cheeky movement of an overcrowded parking lot at Disneyland...a generic goose bump ride
0.5 A movie that, while consistently amusing, plays like a hackneyed effort to stretch a few minutes of ride into a coherent, hour-and- a-half story.
0.6 More Disneyland ride than movie, short on plot and long on dazzling visuals for the kiddies.
0.5 While it may supply giggles and shivers to preteens, grownups should think twice before entering this all-too-haunted house.
0.5 Eddie Murphy has been many things to many people in his tempestuous career. Until now, 'mayo-and-bologna-on-white' hasn't been one of them.
0.5 Perhaps used to working with animated characters, Minkoff fails to inspire much energy from his cast.
0.125 The movie's horror angle also reminds us of Vampire in Brooklyn, the last in a string of Murphy flops before The Nutty Professor saved his screen career in 1996. With this listless foray, Eddie is twice bitten.
0.6 It's notoriously difficult to balance lighthearted humor with the spookiness a good ghost story requires, but director Rob Minkoff is surprisingly successful, delivering a satisfying mix of laughs and mild scares aimed at a young audience.
0.4 The story is so flimsy, could it possibly have been ghostwritten by Goofy?
0.25 A badly scripted, sloppily put-together hack job.
0.5 The problem here isn't so much the pace as the too-predictable story and the general lack of energy; director Rob Minkoff can't seem to light a fire under his cast.
0.5 Haunted Mansion won't be anybody's E-ticket ride, but it's an enjoyable movie for a very specific age range (children 8 to 12), and will be tolerable for almost everyone else.
0.5 Haunted is much more loyal to the original amusement attraction than the freewheeling and more imaginative Pirates film, which is good for nostalgia but not especially good for storytelling.
0.375 Here's a better way to spend your money: go to Disneyland and visit the real Haunted Mansion.
0.6 You don't go to a movie like this for the sparkling repartee; you go to ride the ride one more time, and director Rob Minkoff delivers with a slew of sight gags and character cameos that will keep faith with the fans.
0.4 The Haunted Mansion is disappointing in just about every way. Even the plot, which seems simple enough at first, turns out to be confusing when all is revealed.
0.25 The advertising slogan for The Haunted Mansion warns, 'Check your pulse at the door' -- pretty cheeky for a movie that flatlines for almost all of its 98 minutes.
0.25 The PG rating is purportedly for 'frightening images,' but the only thing frightening is the bland performance Eddie Murphy phones in.
0.625 With The Haunted Mansion, the second movie this year to be based on a popular Disney attraction Eddie Murphy may have finally brought his career back to life.
0.5 Let's face it: This is a movie based on a ride, so, really, how much entertainment can you expect? But at least it is a better bargain than the ride it is shilling.
0.5 It's true that last summer's hit Pirates of the Caribbean is one tough act to follow, but The Haunted Mansion falls short even without such comparisons.
0.4 The Haunted Mansion is well made and acted with a kind of campy glee, but it doesn't scare up enough thrills or laughs to give it the kind of mass appeal of Disney's summer blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean.
0.4 The theme park attraction is actually better entertainment than the movie.
0.2 It's not all that boring, and very little children will like it, but the 'tween crowd will consider this beneath them, as would everyone older.
0.25 Foolish indeed is the mortal family that shells out the copious price of admission for this gobbler.
0.5 That thing going bump in the night? It was my head hitting the armrest.
0.5 Despite some imaginative designs, The Haunted Mansion just sort of lies there, as if -- like some of its characters -- it is waiting to be roused from eternal slumber.
0.625 The Haunted Mansion won't much entertain older family members, but it might be fun for kids and seems headed for a long run on home video.
0.5 Director Rob Minkoff, mindful of his PG rating and young target audience, never tries to scare us to the marrow.
0.2 The film equivalent of the dark, boring period on a haunted house ride before the gondola crashes into another room filled with dirty mirrors.
0.5 This is a 99-minute commercial for a three-minute attraction.
0.4 Trite special effects, uninspired dialogue.
0.5 An efficient, reasonably enjoyable factory product that should scare a 9-year-old just enough and be gone from his or her memory by dinnertime.
0.375 About as much fun as a day at Disneyland -- when it's raining and all the rides are broken and the car is at the extreme other end of the parking lot.
0.5 Although The Haunted Mansion starts promisingly and presents a wealth of possibilities, filmmakers decide to go the formulaic route to bring in the kiddies.
0.375 ...plays like a contest between Eddie Murphy's popping eyes and his gaping mouth: Which one can more forcefully convey fright?
0.4 It's hard to get excited about watching a real estate deal go down, even if it is with a bunch of ghosts.
0.375 ...terminally lame...
0.7 The Haunted Mansion is goofy fun.
0.5 Amusing time-killer.
0.8 More creepy than scary, but it's lots of fun.
0.5 As the story unfolds, it becomes ever more obvious that the Haunted Mansion ride was not concocted to provide enough material for a narratively coherent movie.
0.5 Even if I were still a kid, I'd rather go on the ride.
0.6 only works as mindless entertainment.
0.625 Vivid and unimaginative.
0.625 Amusing but not side-splitting.
0.6 Swirling apparitions, a wonderful Southern gothic atmosphere and a thwarted love story make this a fine companion piece to the Walt Disney theme-park attraction.
0.5 While the addition of four harmonizing statues infuses some humor in the script, there's little that outshines effects in the actual Disneyland house.
0.5 As mechanical as an old Disneyland automaton.
0.625 Never manages to rise above kind of cute.
0.6 The fact that this sort of preachy foray into the pseudo-scary is even remotely entertaining can only be attributed to blind, stumbling luck.
0.6 Best of all is Parker, the perfect melancholy romantic hero, brooding and dark, yet touching and sentimental.
0.5 After she walks off, Daddy tells his son, "Whack your own spider!"
0.2 The Last Airbender is not just a flop, it's a big-budget flop, and it's a throwback to that grand old genre, the movie that's so bad that it's bad.
0.2 A quite breathtakingly inept hodge-podge of vapid spirituality, playground chopsocky and visual effects that take 3D to an entirely new level: Zero-D.
0.4 Writer/director M Night Shyamalan's once glorious reputation is tarnished further by this tediously juvenile fantasy adventure.
0.25 There's no third-act twist because we never get out of the first act.
0.5 [Shyamalan] works so much better with stories that are slower in development, where the atmosphere and tone drive the film, and where you're never quite sure what's going on (though not in the sense where you're completely confused, like this film).
0.2 This is a kid's movie that doesn't seem to realize that it's a kid's movie.
0.3 Bad acting, overstuffed exposition and running time far too brief for the amount of plot shoved into it reduce The Last Airbender into parody of a big summer film as Shyamalan manages to hit every single fantasy film pothole.
0.4 The Last Airbender is a horrific mish-mash of genres that follows a depressingly large number of dead ends in adapting its source material.
0.4 As far as children's entertainment goes (and it is children's entertainment), it could be a lot worse.
0.3 The film is an unmitigated disaster, a putrid patchwork of the original series stitched together by wretched performances, bad creative decisions and a story that's all exposition, no depth.
0.25 Mere words can barely describe the sheer inanity on display.
0.4 It's a nice movie to look at, as long as you ignore the characters, plot, and action.
0.3 It seems as if a good film could be made out of The Last Airbender's tale. But this is not that film.
0.2 The characters are completely uninvolving, the narrative incomprehensible for the most part, and the performances seem to reflect the bewilderment of the plot.
0.4 Why do the water tribe have so much difficulty defeating their fire opponents when the battle takes place on the ocean?
0.2 Unspeakably bad dialogue delivered by excruciatingly bad actors in a plot so illogical and stupid it kills unicorns.
0.3 Shyamalan tells the story like a syndicated news journalist, reporting events with detached direction and lifeless, plot-driven screenwriting.
0.2 The worst part is undoubtedly the script, which clunks and groans all the way under the weight of it's own exposition - tragically and unforgivably, it fails to tell a good story.
0.4 It is in writer/director Shyamalan's dialogue that the film grinds to a halt. His words have grown increasingly pompous and stilted since his concise, crisp, Oscar-nominated script for The Sixth Sense.
0.2 This empty, misfired epic from M. Night Shyamalan is boring and strengthens the claim that he is the worst director working in mainstream cinema today.
0.2 If sleep is a hard thing to come by, then a dose of M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender is just the cure for you.
0.2 Being a Shyamalan film, the entire cast (which also includes Slumdog Millionaire star Dev Patel as an exiled Fire Prince) recite their looney-tunes lines as if they have been drugged, then hypnotised, then drugged again.
0.2 $150,000,000 well wasted. The Last Airbender is an insult to those wanting sophisticated, entertaining or even competent cinema.
0.2 How did Shyamalan get it so wrong?
0.2 Some of the worst acting, action and dialogue you'll endure this year.
0.4 The dialogue is tin-eared in the extreme, the 3D is used in a strictly tokenistic fashion and the absolute lack of a sense of irony or humour makes the more solemn scenes all the more laughable.
0.2 After the first five seconds, it seems as if you have been watching it for around two-and-a-half hours, and that this time has passed in four-and-a-half days.
0.2 Please let it be the last Shyamalan.
0.4 [A] slice of self-important nonsense that's actually pretty funny, although probably not in the way Shyamalan planned.
0.2 Airbender's final insult is the unmistakable stench of a sequel that's left to linger in its wake.
0.4 The first part of a planned trilogy, Shyamalan says the sequel will be darker. Just better would be a start.
0.4 Far from the catastrophe the US bewailed, but still disappointingly clunky.
0.2 One is bored and stupefied by what seems like an eternity of vacuous spectacle, cod-Buddhist tosh and clunking dialogue.
0.2 I swiftly became bored with a repetitive and laboured film devoid of drama, tension or real emotion.
0.4 When nothing you believe or believe in is at stake, your plot-receptor mechanisms close down.
0.2 Dung fu.
0.2 A movie that's as thick as the earth, as enraging as fire, and about as watery and windy as a giant cinematic wet fart.
0.4 A dodgy script, ropey performances, atrocious 3D effects and a tendency to take itself too seriously...
0.2 A derivative and lifeless 'heroes journey' tale layered up with Eastern mysticism.
0.5 ...a tremendously disappointing effort from a once rock-solid filmmaker.
0.2 The Last Airbender completes writer/co-producer/director M. Night Shyamalan's fall from grace; once regarded as the most exciting talent in film, he now sits pretty as the laughing stock of Hollywood.
0.2 I can accurately and completely review The Last Airbender by quoting my ten-year-old daughter's own thoughts on the movie: "They messed up everything."
0.1 The story isn't the bad part of The Last Airbender - in fact, it's the best part... The bad part is almost everything else.
0.375 The Last Airbender blatantly sets the stage for a sequel. Unfortunately, this awful film's huge box office receipts may make a sequel reality.
0.25 An Elemental Disaster.
0.1 Sadly, M. Night Shyamalan has not regained what he lost three films ago. His films are truly bad.
0.125 If the 11th-hour addition of 3-D to M. Night Shyamalan's odious live-action adaptation of Nickelodeon's beloved anime-influenced cartoon series doesn't make your head hurt, the excess of narration and intertitles surely will.
0.25 The time has come to admit that he [Shyamalan] got lucky with Sixth Sense and we overrated his talent.
0.5 a vast and largely joyless--at times leaden--epic
0.3 Even with fairly good special effects the movie is boring; let's hope the indicated sequel(s) doesn't see the light of day.
0.4 I need 'Unbreakable' to be M. Night Shyamalan's trilogy. Not this lifeless fantasy.
0.4 Controversial casting aside, could The Last Airbender ever have been a good movie? Not at all; it's a listless, incompetent, boring mess that insults the comprehension of even the youngest child in the audience.
0.125 The Last Shyamalan.
0.0 Irritatingly stupid.
0.375 It's difficult to ascertain whether this poorly executed picture will earn enough to warrant its planned sequels or not even make enough to allow Shyamalan to Super-Size his next fast-food order.
0.125 Gorgeous imagery.Beautifully wrought special effects. Fantasy fun for all ages.I'm talking , of course, about 'The Last Airbender' website.
0.2 The film ends with a set-up for a sequel, which those unfortunate enough to endure this torturous mess can only hope never occurs.
0.125 In a mediocre summer season, we now have the first bonafide stinker -- a supposed fantasy adventure that has all the magic and mystery of a bologna sandwich.
0.3 Sadly, it seems that Shyamalan is channeling George Lucas et al from The Phantom Menace... and said, 'Hey, let's do that with this movie!'
0.021 A boring, nauseating blockbuster filled with poor editing, painfully wooden acting, unrelenting dullness, and unimpressive special effects. It's so bad that it's gone past good and back to bad again.
0.25 The trunk of my car is filled with busted 3D glasses and broken dreams of summer movie bliss. But that's not as bad as what's in the trunk of a Paramount Pictures bigwig: A bound and gagged Shyamalan, who's about to have $150 million beat from him.
0.25 Stick a fork in M. Night Shyamalan. He's done as a director of consequence after The Last Airbender. Sad.
0.0 Stilted dialogue, wooden acting, glacial pacing, cheesy special effects, tacky-looking sets, ugly costumes, poorly staged and edited action sequences, all shown in murky, cut-rate 3-D.
0.6 Fantasy works best off linear narrative clarity, while many scene transitions whirl like air in the hands of Aang. Yet, Night ignites the separate moments with visual magic worthy of his mythology.
0.2 would be blissfully forgettable if it weren't so blazingly incompetent
0.2 M. Night Shyamalan tries to bend the laws of quality cinema to suit his his shlocky ambitions.
0.0 A dull, boring, poorly acted, limply written and thoroughly unappealing fantasy, featuring bland characters locked in a struggle of no interest.
0.375 With a movie this shockingly bad, however, it's not likely that anyone will be interested in another chapter. So it's better not to even bother seeing this one.
0.875 Shyamalan has taken what could have been a big, flashy, generic Hollywood production and made it wholly his own.
0.2 What a colossal disappointment! Let's hope this truly is the last Airbender.
0.2 All the while, Shyamalan creates an ever-growing sense of 'Who cares where we are; when will this be over?'
0.6 The Last Airbender, for all its Shyamalan-style grandiosity, is completely harmless and inoffensive, and at the very least, Shyamalan appears to be having a little fun here.
0.2 Fans of the beautifully crafted TV show will be bitterly disappointed by this film version of the story.
0.5 The puzzle of Shyamalan's racial casting soon becomes secondary to a much more pressing concern -- trying to follow the cluttered story.
0.0 It's rare to see a film so choppily edited, poorly scripted and spastically directed that you can barely understand what you're watching.
0.375 The title has the ring of prophecy. Although the film frustrates viewers with a cliffhanger ending, it's hard to believe a second 'Airbender' will materialize out of what is likely to be the indifferent reception to this wan hand-me-down.
0.4 A franchise needs more than cute creatures to survive.
0.4 Boring -- but age-appropriate for young fans of the TV show.
0.75 Using the backbone of the Nickelodeon series, Shyamalan succeeds in developing a story with a deep mythology -- something he failed to do with Lady in the Water.
0.1 Everything about this film is so mind-bogglingly stupid, I barely know where to begin!
0.5 Can we please just stop with the 3D conversions? Shymalan delivers visually amazing action sequences but the film suffers from terrible dialogue and horrible acting.
0.3 There are long expository speeches, which the young, inexperienced actors recite by rote, and the entire concept is filled with incoherent inconsistency.
0.3 Tedious, overstuffed, visually flat ... emotionally inert, filled with painfully expository dialogue and mostly poorly acted, it's simply an all-around misfire.
0.15 Paraphrasing a quote from another Shyamalan star, Haley Joel Osment, it seems like "there's dead actors walking around like regular actors." From The Sixth Sense to no sense?
0.2 The picture is crammed with big-budget CGI -- it seems determined to command our interest through sheer technological will.
0.25 It gets real old real fast.
0.375 Even 3-D technology can't inject a much-needed extra dimension to The Last Airbender.
0.2 If you thought it was bad when writer-director M. Night Shyamalan was channeling Rod Serling, wait till you see him try to be George Lucas.
0.375 As a child puts together pieces of the puzzle that will help him save the world from evildoers in The Last Airbender, I was pondering a bigger mystery: How can this action-packed adventure be so deadly dull?
0.75 The Last Airbender is one of the most visually luscious and exhilarating entertainments I have seen this year, full of giddy fireworks and kinetic pleasure.
0.5 Shyamalan's effects -- matte paintings, miniatures, location exteriors, backlot interiors and digital work -- never coalesce into a seamless whole, and the result is neither fish nor fowl, tactile nor virtual.
0.5 The TV show created an incredibly complex world over three seasons. This picture (the first in a proposed trilogy) tries to accomplish a year's worth of work in two hours. So we get titles and flashbacks, baldly expository dialogue and clumsy narration.
0.375 There's no other way to say this: M. Night Shyamalan has completely lost it.
0.25 The addition of the 3-D is obviously an afterthought, and in most scenes it's pretty bad. Almost as bad as the writing and the acting. Almost.
0.0 The Last Airbender could be The Last M. Night Shyamalan Movie. Yep, it's that bad.
0.25 This is bad filmmaking and bad storytelling. It also sounds what should be the death knell to M. Night Shyamalan's career.
0.4 The camera swoops and the music blares, but we might as well be watching a tolerant, teeth-gritting parent filming his son's karate class demonstration.
0.2 It is so bad that not only could Uwe Boll make a better movie than Shyamalan has done here, he already has.
0.375 In spite of all the running and sometimes flying to and fro, The Last Airbender never feels particularly urgent.
0.25 Nothing short of an incomprehensible fiasco. If one must go see it, avoid the 3-D version like the bubonic plague.
0.25 A new low point in Shyamalan's crumbling career.
0.3 The battles are only slightly more exciting than the exposition, the acting is laughable, and the characters are flat.
0.3 The good news for those eagerly anticipating this live-action, big budget adaptation is that the 3D isn't horrible. The bad news? Just about everything else is.
0.5 Shyamalan compresses a ton of plot exposition in every line and the resulting heavyosity is too much for the younger actors to carry.
0.25 Shyamalan takes the beloved Nickelodeon anime series and turns it into 103 minutes of overproduced, stilted nonsense.
0.3 a staid, interminable miscalculation
0.4 The problems begin with Shyamalan's script, which is an orgy of exposition.
0.625 He hasn't mastered the craft yet, but M. Night Shyamalan may be on to something with this action-movie thing.
0.375 Not since Kyle MacLachlan's whispered voice-overs about the worm and the spice and the worm IS the spice in Dune has a fantasy franchise tripped all over itself trying, simply, to please a fan base while creating a new one.
0.125 M. Night Shyamalan throws his hands up and sells out with The Last Airbender, an adaptation of the Nickelodeon anime series that boasts almost no sign of the director's idiosyncratic imprimatur.
0.7 It's worth putting up with M. Night the writer to enjoy the work of M. Night the director.
0.4 Even in 3D, [it's] one-dimensional.
0.5 The sprawling story is so dramatically compressed there is barely enough oxygen for relationship growth (crucial in Avatar), let alone traces of an interesting director's personality.
0.375 The movie has been criticized for racially inappropriate casting, but that's the least of its problems. The acting is laughable, the effects are phony, the editing is addled and the dialogue is disastrous.
0.2 Who would have thought Shyamalan would come up with a movie that makes his Lady in the Water look positively sensible?
0.25 The Last Airbender is dreadful, an incomprehensible fantasy-action epic that makes the 2007 film The Golden Compass, a similarly botched adaptation of a beloved property from another medium, look like a four-star classic.
0.3 While the special effects are impressive enough, M. Night Shyamalan's film doesn't make a lick of sense.
0.25 This colossal folly, the fiasco of the summer of 2010 - gives us all a ringside seat at the sight of Mr. "I See Dead People's" career gurgling down the drain.
0.125 The Last Airbender is an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented.
0.3 Let's just be honest: M. Night Shyamalan is an idiot.
1.0 Inception is the best film of the year and one of the best films of the decade, this is Nolan's masterpiece and it is perfect in every regard.
1.0 A smart and inventive thriller, this drama is one of the year's best movies.
1.0 Nolan has cemented himself among the great filmmakers of our time, not only with this film, but with most of his other works as well.
1.0 Despite its two- and a half-hour length, it flies by and just like a great dream you don't want to wake up from, even after the end credits start, you'll desperately crave five more minutes.
0.6 Ambitious, sure, but ultimately too far-fetched for its own good.
0.8 It's intentionally, thrillingly, disorienting.
0.8 Flaws aside, there's a lot to like about Inception and Nolan keeps his eye on the ball throughout, offering up a lush treat of a thriller with nerve and wit
0.7 Taken at theatrical value, director/writer Christopher Nolan's tale of purposeful memory-travel is a fun and exciting trip into the creative subconscious.
0.875 It is the film by which to measure the density of all others.
0.7 ...there's no denying those special effects. They are spectacular and creative in the extreme.
0.9 The action set pieces are deliriously spectacular; one involving a gravity-impaired Gordon-Levitt in an ever-rotating hallway is wondrous to behold.
0.9 A trippy, complex, thrill-driven action-adventure that demands (and rewards) repeat viewings.
0.6 Un thriller inteligente aunque algo menos complejo de lo que aparenta, que cae en varios excesos narrativos y visuales. Probablemente la pelicula mas ambiciosa de Nolan hasta la fecha.
0.7 I'm somewhat disappointed that Nolan didn't make a different movie, I heartily enjoyed the one he did make.
1.0 Nuevamente Nolan nos sorprende con un ejercicio inteligente y vibrante, con un DiCaprio maduro y un cast perfecto. La cinta del ano para Hollywood.
0.8 Nolan gledateljima prua zabavu za osjetila i intelekt na na&#269;in koji se &#269;ini iznad mogu&#263;nosti najve&#263;eg broja njegovih kolega
1.0 full review at Movies for the Masses
1.0 A classic-in-waiting that will keep you guessing and thinking while you pick your jaw up off the floor.
1.0 Nolan's script keeps the parallel narrative threads concise, and through gorgeous cinematography by Wally Pfister and sharp editing by Lee Smith.
0.875 Is the movie over-thought? Sometimes, yes. But challenging material is rarely as satisfying as in this blockbuster from one of the dream factory's most gifted artisans.
0.9 A marvelous, highly enjoyable film that continues Nolan's climb toward the very top of the list of the best filmmakers working today.
1.0 Intelligent and imaginative Inception is eye bending and mind bending in equal measures.
1.0 Uma ficcao cientifica que faz jus aos melhores do genero, apresentando-nos a conceitos intrigantes e dedicando-se, entao, a explora-los ate suas consequencias mais extremas.
0.65 Inception, which has been talked up to crazy heights and showcases the best, as well as the most problematic, aspects of Nolan's directorial chops.
0.9 Inception made my brain hurt. And it hurt in the most wonderful way.
0.8 Brain, meet spasm. Inception is the cleverest, most original use of a Blockbuster budget we've seen in years. Shame some of the characters are a bit underdeveloped.
0.9 Christopher Nolan proves himself as both a man of action and ideas, as he delves into the male psyche and enriches the soul in Inception.
0.99 "Hooray!"
0.7 Visually stunning Inception trips on its own cleverness, sacrificing character development in the pursuit of ingenuity. One can forgive its hubris and give it credit for being a thinking man's action movie.
1.0 Nolan has spun an elegantly cerebral story that is primal, compelling, and as visually disconcerting as it is completely captivating
0.8 This is a long film with a lot of fiery explosions, intelligent ideas, sputtering machine guns, and violent car crashes.
0.875 An at-times dizzying Mobius strip of a sci-fi thriller, it's both a tremendously challenging and tremendously rewarding movie, the type that will have audiences talking -- and debating -- long after the credits roll.
1.0 A giant win for audiences and the degree to which filmmakers can respect their intelligence.
0.9 Nolan repousse les limites de son cinema pour nous offrir - une fois de plus - son oeuvre la plus dense et stimulante a ce jour.
0.75 This metaphysical 'Mission: Imposible' is motivated by a challenge as great as that facing its heroes: It's Nolan's attempt to crack the Great Film vault. Mission accomplished? Yes -- and more crucially -- no.
1.0 Inception a dynamic, moving mind-bender.
0.8 For all of its capacity to bewilder and befuddle, Inception still must be endorsed purely on the strength of its ambition, and the awesome heights to which it sometimes soars.
0.7 Nolan is having the time of his life in his own personal playground and, for all its heavy technical and narrative machinery, Inception remains one of his lightest films.
0.8 It is irritating for an hour, being so gloomily lit that you need fog lights, then it opens up into a marvellously inventive, somewhat silly but enjoyable heist movie, with a good cast doing things I doubt even they could explain.
0.9 It's just streets ahead of anything I've seen in a long time.
0.9 One of those films, like Blade Runner or 2001 A Space Odyssey, that will repay many viewings in order to grasp all the intricate details of these multi-layered trips into the dreams and nightmares of the central characters.
0.8 [Nolan] has planted the idea that his film is the most brilliant, original and smart film in years. And everyone thinks they realized this on their own.
0.9 And [Nolan] said, "let there be originality", and there was originality. He called it Inception and audiences and critics alike saw that it was good.
1.0 Even its flaws are brilliant -- and without its flaws and a few evidences of self-mocking humor, I'm not sure I'd like it nearly as well as I do.
0.5 Inception is a diverting gambit, but you might want to check your watch a few times to see when the dreams are going to be over.
0.9 Indeed, Hollywood's obsession with 3D has extended to the storytelling process, and with Inception, it also reminds us that story and characterization still rule in the land of a thousand digital vistas.
0.8 Nolan borrows from classic heist and caper movies to design the clockwork tension but this particular clock is more like Dali's dripping watch.
0.8 Cinematically, this is a keeper, a fireworks grand finale that goes on flashing and booming for two hours and twenty-eight minutes. But, oh, for some genuine heart.
0.89 Once in the dreamspace, Nolan's command of multi-layered storytelling is nothing short of astounding.
1.0 the balance of philosophical ideas and narrative tension are more than enough to keep the film not just engaging, but utterly riveting for its entire duration
1.0 Inception is the exception to a boring summer!
0.8 A well-constructed, narratively audacious blockbuster released at a time when such things are in depressingly short supply.
0.5 A patently-preposterous, endlessly-elliptical mindbender that's worth the investment just to be able to say you sat through it, even if you can't follow all of its meandering machinations. It's that hip!
0.875 Despite the fact that some details of the labyrinthine plot are simply too obscure to comprehend on a first viewing, Nolan sells the emotion -- and the consequences -- visually.
1.0 Cinema is rarely this engaging on so many levels.
0.875 This is the kind of film studios need to green light more often... all orchestrated by the crafting hand of a director who knows what he wants and makes it happen.
0.7 Preposterous, but so ingeniously done that it's an entertaining ride.
1.0 Just like a spinning top, you keep hoping Christopher Nolan's movie will last a little bit longer.
0.9 It's heartening to see that the quirky sensibility Nolan brought to 'Memento' has never left him.
0.875 It's bold. It's exciting. It makes you think. It engages. It impresses. It frustrates. And it does it all a helluva lot better than Shutter Island.
1.0 The first masterpiece of 2010. A perfect blend of performance, story, music and effects.
1.0 A dream within a dream.
0.8 The complexity of the plot works to make the film a must see, but it also ends up frustrating the audience because it all can't be figured out on the first viewing
1.0 I suspect even repeat viewings won't be enough to nail this one down: Like 2001, it's both knotty enough and ambiguous enough to lead to conflicting opinions. Besides, our dreams are open to different interpretations, so why not some of our films as well?
0.875 The ending will leave you debating in that glass half-full, half-empty kind of way. Let's just say, it's a movie that needs to be seen more than once.
0.4 Only someone who never saw (or appreciated) Dark City would be able to call it visionary.
1.0 This is not only the best movie ever made about dreams, it is also one of the best films of 2010, and certainly one of the most entertaining pictures I've seen in a decade.
0.875 It is a fascinating visual feast, The Matrix with heart and soul, a rollercoaster ride into layers of the subconscious mind that challenges our ability to keep up.
0.8 What it is (an action-heavy heist movie with several mind-blowing setpieces) is an entirely pleasant substitute for what it isn't (a psychologically complex investigation into dream logic).
0.9 There are plenty of reasons to like Inception, whether you found it obvious or impenetrable. You'll wish you could dream as lucidly as this, but be grateful here you have Nolan as your tour guide.
0.9 It makes 'The Matrix' look like a Dick & Jane book.
0.875 This is a drama built around ideas and images; it is a cinematic maze that Nolan makes his audience traverse in order to follow, understand and appreciate his world.
0.625 Inception is a nightmare for audiences looking for coherent fiction.
0.988 A groundbreaking, intriguing, exhilarating and brilliant sci-fi thriller that's destined to become a timeless classic. Mark my words: It will be remembered for years to come.
0.84 Who are we to complain when a filmmaker lets his thoughts get the better of him, especially when most summer blockbusters aren't thinking at all.
0.875 The movie is almost hypnotic -- a mind-bending experience laced with palpable tension and fueled with drama. Sweet dreams.
0.8 Inception is an intense, complex story, but it's always coherent, imaginative, and entertaining.
0.625 More time wasting than time bending, Inception is a shoot 'em up masquerading as a thinking person's sci-fi film.
0.75 This sophisticated and uniquely clever cinematic concoction is a refreshing change from the usual lineup of mindless summer fare. The acting and dialogue take a back seat to the mind-blowing action that is...
0.625 Nolan is a very clever fellow, no argument there. He's skilled at juggling big ideas and making us think. Now if he can just make us feel.
0.9 The final half-hour alone is a miracle of clockwork-precise showmanship.
1.0 It's only the latest indication that Christopher Nolan might be the slyest narrative tactician making movies today.
0.75 Pretty good, not bad, but brilliant it surely ain't.
1.0 Inception is a boldly constructed wonder with plenty of -- as one character describes it -- "paradoxical architecture."
0.9 I found myself admiring the movie's stubborn adherence to its own universe and logic.
0.875 Nolan's tale is not only a trip through mental labyrinths but a reminder that memories may cripple us, unless we learn to let them go.
1.0 Inception, the latest in Nolan's long list of awe-inspiring films, proves to be his most ambitious and satisfying project to date.
0.6 The good news is, I'm not going to give away any of the mind-bending twists at the center of Inception. The bad news is, that's because there aren't any.
0.4 Inception is so slow and so confusing that you may actually fall asleep. Or wish you were really dreaming and could wake up and dream another movie.
0.4 Mixes arcane talk about dreams with traditional action sequences resulting in strange and ineffective hybrid.
0.2 Are they handing out joints at the box office for this?
1.0 This is a movie people will go see and then argue about and then, very likely, go see again. It is instantly the must-see film of the summer.
0.8 By turns overpowering, spectacular and truly awe-inspiring. Nolan has just taken it to the next level.
0.875 Inception is that rare film that can be enjoyed on superficial and progressively deeper levels, a feat that uncannily mimics the mind-bending journey its protagonist takes.
1.0 You know how much of a cheat it is when a movie concludes with a character waking up and realizing it was all a dream? Inception goes another way: Its characters wake up from their dreams to figure out what's real.
1.0 The most audacious and multifaceted Hollywood entertainment for grown-ups I've seen in years.
0.625 Wrapped up in the logistics of various dreamscapes and the technical details of dream sharing and inception, the picture all but abandons its most essential thread.
0.4 Inception becomes its own nightmare by trying to be "too" smart.
0.875 The visual effects are outstanding, including a fight scene that rivals any ever put on film.
0.9 Inception is the most astonishing thing you will see all year. It may be one of the most astonishing things you will ever see.
0.9 The first of [Nolan's] films that I would call flat-out fun.
1.0 Does the long-anticipated Christopher Nolan film Inception deliver what we've been hoping for? In a word: Yes.
0.9 t has all of Nolan's strengths, and some of his weaknesses, and it is undeniably his. It is a $160 million action film about loss and regret, and it is exciting in part because of its flaws.
0.75 Inception is often thrilling to watch, but there's something hollow at its center.
0.2 (S)tories should show, not tell, and Nolan keeps telling us that he can't tell this story.
0.8 The first of many major achievements in this memorable and haunting film is to render other people's dreams - not the most interesting of topics normally - absolutely riveting.
1.0 In a decade dominated by the three dreaded Rs of remakes, reimaginings and reboots comes a truly original blockbuster.
1.0 The most intelligent and visually stunning film of the year. Literally mind-bending.
0.875 All it asks of viewers is that they do something rare: engage the intellect.
0.9 A grandiose exploration of the subconscious and a blazing piece of puzzlemaking.
1.0 It's the kind of thing that only comes along once every few decades.
1.0 An intellectualized action flick or an action-packed intellectual film? The answer, of course, is that it's both.
0.75 Like any traditional narrative, it starts at point A and ends at point B. It just goes backward through the alphabet to get there.
0.75 A heist picture at heart, the dream-world-set thriller harkens back to the reality-shifting days of "The Matrix," but edges toward intelligence in all of the places the Wachowski brothers opted for visceral popcorn thrills.
0.5 Rule of thumb: if a movie uses the word "deep" as much as this one does, it probably isn't.
0.875 I absolutely loved every minute of it.
1.0 The ambition on display is so huge, and the filmmaking so intelligent, you'll emerge feeling as if you've just watched an entire season of the greatest sci-fi series never made.
0.9 You have to love a movie that dares people to think big.
0.8 This is a popular entertainment with a knockout punch so intense and unnerving it'll have you worrying if it's safe to close your eyes at night.
1.0 Nolan's film is surely the most ambitious psychological thriller ever, and yet also the most personal. His baroque imagination makes most directors' efforts look like beach-pail sand castles alongside Mad King Ludwig's Neuschwanstein Castle.
0.5 Meanwhile, explanations are offered, buildings collapse on themselves, DiCaprio frets moodily, henchmen fall over and that white van keeps falling off that bridge ... It's all very beautiful, and mostly very empty.
1.0 unlike anything you've seen
0.875 As the dreams build upon each other and Cobb's past creeps through, Nolan has us just where he wants us -- deliriously lost in a world where dreams and reality are indecipherable, and curious enough to stand in line for another showing.
1.0 This is what movies can be like if you try.
0.6 Mr. DiCaprio exercises impressive control in portraying a man on the verge of losing his grip, but Mr. Nolan has not, in the end, given Cobb a rich enough inner life to sustain the performance.
0.875 Inception is the rare blockbuster entry as sophisticated and intelligent as it is exciting and spectacular.
0.8 The fact that it manages to be both unmissable and maddening doesn't kill the immediate buzz, since half the film's thrills consist of simply keeping up with it.
0.875 In this smart sci-fi puzzle box, director Christopher Nolan transports the audience to a dreamscape that begins with the familiar and then takes a radical, imaginative leap.
0.8 Like a dream, Nolan's film fades swiftly in the light -- but while it lasts, it feels like there's nothing more important to decipher.
1.0 Leonardo DiCaprio's new thriller is as good as live action cinema gets...and you're about to have some very deep dreams to prove it.
1.0 This truly remarkable movie represents imagination of the highest order conducted by a true master of the art of motion pictures.
0.5 Without a substantial story to support the whole, the piece is as weightless as the 'Zzzzzz team' itself, floating through the multiple levels of dreams within dreams.
0.8 Even minor roles are filled by sterling talent (including Michael Caine as Cobb's mentor), which is testament to the originality and precision of Christopher Nolan. His is a mind that's definitely worth getting lost in.
0.6 Inception may be the brainiest hokum ever released in a cinematic summer. Imagine Last Year in Marienbad wandering into the orbit of producer Jerry Bruckheimer.
1.0 Inception is one of the most original, thought-provoking, intense, mind-blowing pieces of entertainment I have ever seen. I would pay money to watch people's reactions.
0.8 Emotional intimacy is lacking, with some characters functioning merely as devices to explain an increasingly complicated scenario, but there's no doubt that Nolan knows how to craft an enthralling brainteaser.
1.0 After thinking it'd take "a couple months" to ink, director Christopher Nolan took eight years to painstakingly write the "Inception" script. And you can tell. It's his first pure masterpiece.
0.8 It was a brave move to follow The Dark Knight, one of the biggest hits of all time, with something so incredibly complex, but Nolan can relax -- it's worked like a dream.
1.0 A conceptual coup that, in dealing with the shifting logic and fractured reality of dreams, frees itself from the need to satisfy any conventions, formulae or expectations.
1.0 It's a long movie (2.5 hours) but doesn't feel so, and is the rare would-be blockbuster that demands close attention and would surely reward rewatching.
0.875 With Inception, writer/director Christopher Nolan not only cements his status as Hollywood's most innovative filmmaker, he has created a daring genre: the surrealist heist thriller. Or, maybe he has developed the dream invasion action epic.
0.7 ...part heist caper, part Jungian fugue-state where dreams stack up inside each other like Russian nesting dolls.
0.625 Personally, I got more thrills out of the simple animation of Richard Linklater's Waking Life.
1.0 More filmmakers need to abandon the Ikea guide to making Hollywood movies (Step 73: Keep hammering cliche) and close their eyes for a little nap.
0.9 Whether [DiCaprio] confronts lost love or the dream world crumbles in a glorious symphony of exploding fruit and buildings, Inception is beautiful, high-class chaos.
0.8 It is that rarest of beasts: a slippery, cerebral summer blockbuster that slaloms from illusion to reality and back again and leaves its viewer bewitched, bothered and bewildered.
1.0 It's said that Christopher Nolan spent ten years writing his screenplay for Inception. That must have involved prodigious concentration, like playing blindfold chess while walking a tight-wire.
1.0 The movies have produced one of their rare works of great art, disguised as an action thriller -- a thoughtful and thought-provoking meditation disguised as a con game carried out in a dream ... within a dream ... within a dream.
0.75 It's gratifying to experience a summer movie with large visual ambitions and with nothing more or less on its mind than (as Shakespeare said) a dream that hath no bottom.
0.7 Surely the most intellectually and viscerally engaging action film in years.
0.75 One of the best things about Nolan as a director is that he's not self-conscious. His movies unfold and fold in on themselves without the strain of labor or flash. But that lack of self-consciousness is also Nolan's downside.
0.625 The dream logic of Inception -- which deals, like Nolan's far more intriguing Memento, with the architecture of memory and the nature of reality -- is stymied by a clunking script, crammed with expository exchanges and urgent blather.
1.0 Inspired at times by movie classics, modern and otherwise - 'Dark City' and 'Minority Report,' but also 'Metropolis,' 'Citizen Kane' and the best 007 adventures - it earns its place in the same conversation, a tribute to Nolan's ingenuity.
0.9 A singular film that seeps into your brain so much so that you might leave the theater looking at the world differently.
0.625 Writer/director Christopher Nolan is too obsessed with the mechanics of the gimmick and plot of Inception to make any intellectual leaps off the screen.
0.7 A remarkable achievement in ingenuity and storytelling.
0.5 For a motion picture set within the boundless reaches of the subconscious, Inception is depressingly lacking in imagination.
1.0 Consider this as a form of inception from a film review: see it again, and while you're at it, see it a third time.
1.0 No matter how high your personal expectations for "Inception" may be, the film not only meets but wildly exceeds them.
1.0 One of the most intoxicating, challenging and beautiful movies of the 21st century, deserving of multiple Oscar nominations.
1.0 Inception is the first masterful video game movie (never mind that it isn't based on a video game).
1.0 A masterpiece on a grand scale that is not just an ingenious work of science fiction but may be the best film since Rear Window to play along with your mind's eye on how we view movies altogether.
1.0 Inception is either a great, mind-bending movie or one big swindle. Let's go with the former.
0.6 Christopher Nolan's existential sci-fi heist flick is always riveting, if not always comprehensible.
0.375 Inception is Instruction Manual Cinema, a film that spends so much time explaining the rules of its narrative conceit that it fails to either emotionally engage or, except in a few notable spots, viscerally thrill.
1.0 The simplest way to sum up the greatness of Inception is to identify it as a new classic of science-fiction cinema (and, for that matter, the heist genre).
1.0 Brilliantly directed and superbly conceived, this is a genuinely exciting, intelligent thriller with stunning visuals, gripping action scenes, a brilliantly constructed script and terrific performances from a note-perfect cast.
0.25 None of this prattling drivel adds up to one iota of cogent or convincing logic. You never know who anyone is, what their goals are, who they work for or what they're doing.
1.0 A sublime brain-twister of a movie that plays out so intricately on so many levels simultaneously that a bathroom break comes at your own peril.
1.0 A master stroke from a director in his prime. Inception is leagues above any live action film released in 2010.
0.8 How can it be that a bunch of people sitting around scheming nonsense can prove so compelling? Only David Fincher knows how to take a studio's money and spin it as stylishly as Nolan.
0.75 Inception is an elegant, portentous ride, though I'm not sure Nolan is any closer to visualizing the real (dream) deal than Hitchcock was.
1.0 While the mind-bending story might not be as cerebral as it seems, it completely envelops us
1.0 Watching Inception is like striking a match and setting your brain on fire.
0.875 In this wildly ingenious chess game, grandmaster Nolan plants ideas in our heads that disturb and dazzle. The result is a knockout. But be warned: Inception dreams big.
0.875 At first, Inception left me cold, feeling as if I'd just eavesdropped on somebody's bad acid trip. Now I find I can't get the film out of my mind, which is really the whole point of it, isn't it?
1.0 So now I've watched Inception, had my mind splattered all over the theater just like I knew it would be, and I still don't really know what it's about. That's just how amazing this movie is.
1.0 Can a summer blockbuster with a multi-million dollar budget really be this smart, moving and intellectually thrilling? Pinch yourselves, we could still be dreaming.
0.9 The next step in [Christopher] Nolan's evolution as one of the master filmmakers of our time ... combines the jaw-dropping action of The Dark Knight with the ingenious plotting of Memento.
1.0 You will no doubt need to see Inception more than once to appreciate every nuance of Nolan's carefully balanced ambiguities - but, more importantly, you will also want to.
1.0 Mind-bending and time-twisting, it's the most exciting thrill-ride of the summer.
1.0 The visuals, with their sweeping grey-blue Gotham-like cityscapes and preference for real-life stunts over computer trickery, are jaw-past-yer-knees outstanding.
0.8 A film erupting with ideas, ambition and intelligence, one that credits the viewer with the capacity for some mental heavy lifting.
1.0 It is hugely impressive that, given what was at stake, Nolan has managed to not only pull this out of the bag, but to absolutely nail it. The film is as all-encompassing as the concept of its title: grand, epic, smart and unforgettable.
1.0 With physics-defying, thunderous action, heart-wringing emotion and an astonishing performance from DiCaprio, Nolan delivers another true original: welcome to an undiscovered country.
0.95 Nolan's most personal and daring film, "Inception" contains some of Nolan's most innovative ideas since "Memento." It's also his most successful movie in terms of being able to fully realize every nuance of such a rich concept.
1.0 Inception could very well be Nolan's masterpiece.
0.9 Inception doesn't just dream bigger than most movies even dare, but it leaves the audience feeling inspired to do the same.
1.0 I expected a lot,but still walked out hypnotized. Here's a movie that's 3 steps ahead of you, on 4 different levels, at 5 blinding speeds. Best of 2010 thus far. (No Spoilers)
1.0 A wildly entertaining and dazzling mind-trip not to be missed. Kubrick would have been proud.
1.0 Inception is a masterpiece. Making a huge film with big ambitions, Christopher Nolan never missteps and manages to create a movie that, at times, feels like a miracle.
0.6 [Transcendence] is more than just a big budget version of Siri Goes Wild.
0.4 At once both convoluted and shallow, something like a feature movie version of a Wired sidebar, and just about as fleet-footed.
0.5 Pfister seems afraid to recognize the humor inherent in a story that requires Johnny Depp to become a grim sort of Max Headroom...
0.2 It is not only a bad film, it is a rather boring film.
0.5 While Transcendence starts out with a fascinating premise, it loses its way pretty quickly by turning into a sappy and ultimately silly film that isn't able to capitalize on the lofty ideas contained within.
0.6 Parece nao fazer a menor ideia acerca das ideias que pretende defender, dos conceitos que quer apresentar ou mesmo da natureza de seus proprios personagens.
0.4 "'Transcendence' winds up being in the position of being the first - but certainly not the last - big disappointment of the 2014 Summer Movie Season."
0.4 Transcendence neither thrills nor illuminates. In fact in many respects it is downright cowardly in its failure to pursue its many themes, with threads of ideas never woven into a whole.
0.4 Here's yet another example of a high-concept mega-movie that appears to have gone into production a draft or two too early.
0.7 It is streets ahead of most of what we get that is labeled science fiction. It's intelligent. It explains its premise -- within reason. Its dialogue isn't chuckleheaded.
0.5 With a script as loopy as this one, it pays to cast intelligent-looking actors. They can delude you into feeling as if you're watching something interesting.
0.7 With actors this good, we'll go almost anywhere, even unto that silliness.
0.5 built on a set of intriguing moral and ethical conundrums involving our relationship with rapidly evolving computer technology, but it finds virtually no dramatic traction
0.6 A relatively entertaining way to upload your consciousness for 119 minutes.
0.375 What an empty and misguided movie this is.
0.4 A genuine artificial intelligence would've completely redesigned this film.
0.6 Anyone with a fondness for broad canvas, ideas-heavy sci-fi should ignore the negative scuttle and give Transcendence the benefit of the doubt.
0.85 ...no doubt there's an interesting movie to be plotted along [these] lines. But for all its pretension, Transcendence isn't it. It's just a big dumb popcorn muncher.
0.6 Far too slow-paced to work as a thriller and too shallow to properly challenge us as science fiction, this film is unlikely to please many audience members.
0.5 ...a misguided failure that hardly bodes well for Pfister's directorial career.
0.4 A lighter touch could have produced campy, B-movie pleasures from the material, but Pfister's solemn approach drains the fun from the film. And a miscast Depp, his star wattage surprisingly dimmed, fails to supply the missing spark.
0.2 Depp used to be the most reliable actor in Hollywood. Not anymore.
0.2 What should have been a brain in a vat just became a brain in a blender.
0.6 A giant third-act bellyflop isn't quite enough to spoil it totally.
0.4 An A-list cast and talented filmmaker are wasted on a B-Movie script with pretentions of prescience.
0.2 Unfortunately, it ends up playing like Max Headroom Conquers the Universe.
0.5 Despite boasting a seemingly ripe filmmaker working with proven actors, the result feels more like a bigger budgeted yet disappointing episode of The Outer Limits.
0.5 An intriguing concept that devolves into a somewhat silly adventure tale, 'Transcendence' is overly long and contrived.
0.6 As a thriller set in the genuinely fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence, it is a disappointment.
0.6 With this cast and these ideas, Transcendence is enjoyable but a missed opportunity.
0.4 Pfister should be applauded for making a non-franchise property with ideas and aspirations but Transcendence is nowhere near as grand as its title. Gleaming visuals aside, it's a disappointment.
0.25 Remember when paycheck-hungry actors were accused of phoning in a performance? Johnny Depp spins that for millennials in Transcendence by Skpying in his performance.
0.2 This is like a heavy-handed and humourless version of Spike Jonze's postmodern comedy Her, mulched in with the old sci-fi novel Donovan's Brain, about keeping someone's brain alive in a tank.
0.4 Transcendence is a sci-fi movie that should be daft fun but is, disappointedly, plodding and dull.
0.4 Pfister's experience shows in that the film is beautifully arranged; unfortunately, that's the best thing about it.
0.2 The only part of [Depp] still genuinely dynamic is his hair. I'm worried.
0.5 Transcendence borrows ideas from so many sci-fi sources it turns into a messy cinematic stew that fails to deliver its own unique flavor.&#8233;
0.2 The worst, most portentous, and certainly the silliest big-budget science fiction film since the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still.
0.7 Look, I think it goes so over the top... There are so many twists and turns too. But, look, basically I think this is an entertainment.
0.5 The irony for Depp is that the better he is in the role the more thankless it becomes.
0.4 The strangest thing about Paglen's script is how out of step it feels with modern technology - it could have been lingering in a drawer since the mid-'90s, so outmoded is its tone.
0.5 Unfortunately, this excellent set-up is squandered in a miasma of truly, frustratingly obtuse plot holes and ludicrous gaps in logic.
0.4 A decade late and a dongle short.
0.48 The performances are fine, as one would expect with this cast, but the writing and sadly the directing in "Transcendence" lacked the vision or coherence necessary to make such a high-concept film fly.
0.3 'Transcendence' seems to be simultaneously making a case for and against technology, and while this level of ambiguity can be compelling in a good movie, in a lousy one it just winds up being frustrating.
0.5 When it's all over, you will turn on your iPhone and ask Siri to find you a good restaurant for a bite to eat near the theater. And you will have learned nothing.
0.4 Rebecca Hall['s] impersonation of grief and a crumbling psyche is by far the most film's most human aspect.
0.5 Transcendence aspires to be a philosophical rumination about the future of artificial intelligence, but it's really just an exercise in superficial intelligence.
0.39 A techno-thriller that systematically squanders an interesting concept. Overstuffed but underdeveloped, it mistakes serial incident for dramatic connection.
0.5 Depending on how the next few decades unfold, people will look back at Transcendence as either a prophetic or surreal piece of filmmaking.
0.6 The ending fails to pack an emotional punch. But Pfister and Paglen have come up with something unusual - a sci-fi blockbuster that's genuinely surprising.
0.6 It's a woefully imperfect movie, but it does look ahead to some brilliant concepts.
0.2 Muddled, simplistic, highly derivative thriller that's filled with techno-babble and turns out to be terminally boring.
0.75 Transcendence continually reaches for big ideas. It has a go-for-broke ambition that may mark it as ahead of its time.
0.5 Transcendence has some astounding cinematography, but it lacks a heartfelt performance from anyone in the cast. It's like a chunky puree of The Lawnmower Man, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and the ending to The World's End.
0.5 Johnny Depp proves he is no Her as his artificial-intelligence film fails to provoke thought or feeling.
0.7 ...an intelligent, complex movie about artificial intelligence that delves deep into some of the issues the overrated Her only touched on.
0.35 A downright boring motion picture that turns a pretty fun concept into nothing more than a progression of disjointed, academic plot points.
0.4 Dark, pretentious sci-fi thriller tackles big questions.
0.8 Transcendence is full of enough intriguing ideas about the future and humanity's relationship with technology to overlook some of the film's tonal and narrative hiccups.
0.75 In a way, the relatively balanced approach that Transcendence takes to its subject matter is the most interesting thing about it.
0.5 More than 40 years after 'Colossus: The Forbin Project,' they couldn't come up with something better than this?
0.4 They must've titled this movie with total irony, because Transcendence stumbles hard in its attempt to rise above.
0.4 A technology run amok flick about artificial intelligence that isn't intelligent -- artificial or otherwise.
0.6 For a movie looking to raise a clenched fist against technology, Transcendence feels more like a limp handshake with the devil.
0.5 What is an initially imaginative and thought-provoking concept, instead sings the same chorus of super technology as super evil we've seen many times before.
0.3 Depressingly inert. A sad waste of talent.
0.5 The whole of "Transcendence" feels more in tune with computers than it does with people. It has some intelligence of the artificial kind, but it could have used some heart.
0.875 Pfister proves to be as clever a storyteller as he is a painter of moving pictures.
0.5 Depp appears mostly from the waist-up on a computer screen, mumbling in a monotone voice that would lull a cup of coffee to sleep.
0.45 ...possesses a lot of the same handsome camera work that seamlessly melded with special-effects in Nolan's "Inception" for which Pfister won the Oscar. It is the story and in particular the film's closing act that lets the entire production down.
0.2 The Lawnmower Man, Max Headroom and Johnny Depp walk into a bar. They get drunk and decide to make a movie.
0.5 The directorial debut for ace cinematographer Wally Pfister is always watchable, but the narrative flaws and logical leaps sabotage sustained enjoyment. "Transcendence" looks and sounds like a Christopher Nolan film that got attacked by malware.
0.625 Soon the worlds of technology and humanity collide - super-medicine, super-intelligence, super-ecosystems, super-confusing!
0.625 Lost in the land of mind over matter, Transcendence is too much trance and not nearly enough dance.
0.75 Transcendence is a movie that sneaks up on you.
1.05 The heartbeat of "Transcendence" comes from solid performances in the leading roles.
0.625 A throwback to the fear-mongering science fiction of the past...the lab-bound likes of The Andromeda Strain and Demon Seed, circa the paranoid '70s.
0.5 Every idea with potential is raised in the first act of Transcendence, never to be heard from again.
0.3 "Transcendence" takes itself so seriously that it's absolutely no fun at all. And while the central concept is initially intriguing, it takes forever to go nowhere very interesting.
0.8 Bold, beautiful, sometimes confounding flight of futuristic speculation firmly rooted in the potential of today's technology.
0.6 It's the simple boy-girl connection between the popularly quirky Depp and the always lovely Hall that holds it all together.
0.625 Transcendence is a big-idea movie, the kind to cause spontaneous salivation in science-fiction fans. But big ideas don't always fit neatly onto the big screen.
0.5 Unfortunately, it takes more than grand concepts to make a movie and the lack of cinematic connective tissue is apparent in this poorly focused, meandering, and ultimately disappointing film.
0.625 Includes some genuine chemistry between Depp and Hall, which puts heart and soul into this machine.
0.5 Transcendence has hints of a richly complex story, but too often feels content just dumping the pieces of its puzzle out on the table without doing much assembly - or even making sure all the pieces are even there.
0.4 In his first film as director, acclaimed cinematographer Wally Pfister (The Dark Knight Rises, Inception) has made a movie that predictably looks good but has little substance beneath its shiny, digitally enhanced surface.
0.5 How can you tell a movie is the directorial debut of a renowned cinematographer? When everything's interesting to look at except the performances.
0.25 In his first, and likely last, outing as a director, cinematographer Wally Pfister delivers a garbled, dispiriting, pseudo-cerebral non-thriller.
0.6 While it dresses up its designs in fancy high tech speak and struggles to find a way to make its often distant and unexplained characters likeable, it's still just a routine genre take on the old "man playing God" concept.
0.7 A sci-fi thriller that is carried into our consciousness by Rebecca Hall's heartfelt and nuanced performance.
0.5 A far-fetched, futuristic snooze-fest that often defies its own logic. Characters' motivations are rarely clear, and allegiances shift with no explanation.
0.375 If you programmed an algorithm to figure out how The Lawnmower Man might be retold by Snake Plissken at the conclusion of Escape from L.A., you'd still wind up with a more recognizably human effort.
0.4 Transcendence wants to leave itself open to interpretation but it does so in the laziest way possible; by leaving every option on the table and forgetting that without choice there are no consequences and without consequence there is no meaning.
0.4 Transcendence wants [...] to comment meaningfully on our current interconnectedness and inorganic lifestyle, but it's screaming too much to have that conversation.
0.5 Transcendence can't quite decide what it wants to say about individualism and the Internet, or about true love between a woman and a digitally Xeroxed man.
0.1 Transcendence's main problem is that it feels like a film made by a computer -- it knows where all the beats and breaks of an action film have to go, but doesn't know why, exactly ...
0.125 Drags science fiction back to the Cold War era, if not the Stone Age.
0.25 Aside from a few scenes where he's walking around in a suit, Depp could have shot in his living room while instant-messaging his agent about the next Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
0.625 Even when ensconced in a traditional shoot-'em-up, the film still kicks around some heady ideas. If only there were some underlying momentum to energize such poetic, intellectual flourishes.
0.4 Transcendence can only muster a sloppy, dull, inept watch that refuses to present a single exciting idea about man's inevitable technological self-destruction - despite Wally Pfister's eye for visual beauty.
0.4 A bright idea, disappointingly dulled in the execution.
0.5 It isn't a terrible movie, just a frustrating one that is far from transcendent.
0.375 The real trouble with "Transcendence" is that it just isn't all that scary - at least not in the way that it wants to be.
0.5 "Transcendence" is an ambitious movie, but ultimately there's too much "artificial" and not enough "intelligence."
0.625 It's fine to want to explore and just sort of kick ideas around. Too often, though, the movie doesn't feel ambiguous or complicated, merely muddled and wishy-washy.
0.4 It's the old story, I'm afraid: the essential boringness of omnipotence as a plot device.
0.5 For all of its big ideas ... Transcendence ends up lacking when it comes to translating them into a compelling story.
0.7 The film will either grip or bore one to tears, depending on a tolerance for speculative babble.
0.6 It's entertaining enough. But the premise promised so much more.
0.5 After an intriguing start, "Transcendence" - aka "The Computer Wore Johnny Depp's Tennis Shoes" - offers roughly the same level of excitement as listening to hold music during a call to tech support.
0.5 "Transcendence" never grapples with the concepts it introduces, sticking to an absolute-genius-corrupts-absolutely plot that was old back in the first season of "Star Trek," and ending with a muffled whimper.
0.5 "Transcendence" traffics in a lot of interesting ideas, but does so in unoriginal ways.
0.4 Tosses out some intriguing ideas, and then spends the next two hours completely squandering them.
0.5 "Transcendence" is much too lofty a title for a film that is rarely, if ever, transcendent.
0.63 Ultimately, the film is a missed opportunity; long on ideas and short on execution.
0.5 While its discussions about supercomputers, transcendence and god complexes send red flags flying about the near future, the story's mainframe is faultily wired and in need of repair.
0.4 It shows little interest in exploring the potentially tricky benefits of a computer-enhanced intellect; it's not even in the enjoyable realm of starkly ridiculous Cold War thrillers like Colossus: The Forbin Project.
0.6 Transcendence is a movie that's of two minds. It's well-grounded, but also over the top. It's a man-vs.-machine epic and also an intimate drama. It's quirky-smart yet sci-fi silly. And it winds up being half as good as it could be.
0.5 Wally Pfister's film tries to ask big questions but isn't smart enough to answer them.
0.25 It's not a horrible premise for a movie, but the execution is exceedingly trite and sloppy.
0.3 Pretty damned bad, and another example of 2014 CG used to animate 1974's science fiction ideas.
0.25 What fresh hell is this?
0.6 Any momentum is swallowed up by its failed attempts at being smarter than everyone in the room, which isn't exactly a good way to keep an audience invested.
0.375 Depp doesn't suggest higher intelligence. Perhaps because he hasn't had to in decades.
0.5 "Transcendence" is clunky and lifeless. It's like the movie version of a paranoid TED talk.
0.5 'Transcendence' lets narrative inertia fill in where the screenplay doesn't.
0.4 Readily the worst thing Steven Spielberg has ever made.
0.62 I never held The Lost World in such high esteem, but I watched it multiple times and always felt it got a bit of a bum rap. After checking it out again fourteen years later, I still feel the same way.
0.6 Nastier beasts and mean people in intense sequel.
0.75 This summer's blockbuster to beat is beach reading for the big screen, and why should it be otherwise?
0.6 Nothing extinct here, just pure dino-might!
0.2 This film is going to sink into well-deserved oblivion.
0.5 Been there, done that. Now there's just more of it.
0.7 The story, it must be said, is no great shakes, although it's not half bad by action-movie standards. But the action -- that's why we go see movies like this -- is terrific.
0.25 The Lost World has the vibe of 'obligatory sequel,' just what director Steven Spielberg probably wanted to avoid.
0.8 Spielberg amply delivers the goods with...The Lost World: Jurassic Park, a beautifully crafted series of nightmarish set pieces with no other goal in mind than to scare and delight the audience.
0.5 Special effects demand dino closeups, but the technical miracles seem sadly mundane.
0.375 A cheerless, heartless monstrosity.
0.75 The Lost World is a tremendously enjoyable action adventure.
0.6 Many people will find much to divert them in The Lost World, and not worry whether or not it falls short of Jurassic Park.
1.0 The Lost World: Jurassic Park is one of those rare sequels that is better than the original.
0.5 The fact that the movie is literally dull comes as a surprise, especially with the usually reliable Spielberg at the helm.
0.3 It was inevitable that they would make a sequel, but did it have to be this one?
0.5 Just watching dinosaurs attacking and killing stupid people is not enough.
0.75 Although the film has more of nearly everything than its predecessor, somehow the result is less.
0.625 This was made to make money and entertain. And I think it achieved both of those, although not in any kind of spades.
0.6 It delivers a few thrills, some nice dinosaur effects, and packed theaters.
0.5 It's just like watching Jurassic Park for the fifth time, when it's hard to get worked up over a film which has little going for it besides big mechanical lizards.
0.6 With the low-angle, out-of-focus, washed-out photography, it looks like Spielberg slapped this thing together on his weekends away from DreamWorks.
0.625 Offers less screen rapture for your raptor than its predecessor did, unless your sole priority is dino-mighty effects.
0.875 Lost World: Jurassic Park is the epitome of American mainstream action movies
0.8 Steven Spielberg in his ruthless cat-playing-with-a-mouse mode.
0.9 Spielberg has made a riveting, exciting, high-grade creature feature, with lots of stompin' and chompin' goin' on.
0.8 Not as good as the original, but as far as sequels go, it's way, way above average.
0.75 Repetitiveness notwithstanding, The Lost World boasts several edge-of-the-seat moments.
0.7 The Lost World feels like less of a movie than it does a carnival ride -- all precipitous highs and nerve-jangling lows.
0.6 While the film suffers from the been-there, done-that syndrome, and has some major structural problems, as far as sequels go, The Lost World is one of the better ones.
0.625 Steven Spielberg is no stranger to sequels. But The Lost World grinds along as his most mechanical effort.
0.4 This film is a boring, unoriginal and ultimately dreary rehash of Jurassic Park.
0.5 Whereas Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park filled viewers with awe over the grandeur of nature, his sequel, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, achieves 134 minutes of tedium.
0.5 Where is the awe? Where is the sense that if dinosaurs really walked the earth, a film about them would be more than a monster movie? Where are the ooohs and ahhhs?
0.25 Spielberg's dinos, manipulated by a small army of puppeteers, are watchable enough. But these artificial critters have little reason to be resurrected in our era, let alone on 3,300 screens over Memorial Day weekend.
0.75 Despite all of the basic improvements going into the production, the perfectly entertaining finished product still somehow manages to fall short of the original film.
0.6 The Lost World certainly has its moments but it's a rather schizophrenic movie that lacks the simplicity of the original.
0.5 The Lost World, while terrifically entertaining, is also structurally out of kilter.
0.6 A teen horror film with grown-up violence.
0.4 A misfire on a classic remake.
0.6 The original was far better.
1.0 One almost never says that a SECOND remake is worth a dang, but this is that very rare exception to prove the rule.
0.8 A very effective horror remake that's driven by character rather than cheap shocks.
0.6 Okay remake. Might have been better is screenwriter Stuart Gordon had directed.
0.8 One of the creepiest and most overlooked horror movies made in the past decade, featuring a strong, scary turn by Meg Tilly.
0.6 Won't ever challenge Siegel's or Kaufman's versions, but it's a pretty worthwhile adaptation for fans of Jack Finney's source material.
0.6 Instead of really being scary, the film made me think of something that has troubled me since: don't movie characters watch movies?
0.9 For those of us who love Hammer horror, this is an unmarred example of all the reasons why.
0.4 Perhaps the most deadly dull in a series that had run out of steam.
0.875 One of the finest of the seven entries in Hammer's Frankenstein cycle.
0.875 [Miyazaki's] visually brilliant, thematically rich fable isn't just an ambitious cartoon; it's an epic, hand-drawn in pen and ink.
0.625 Done mostly in the style of hand-painted classic animation, with occasional digital assists, "Princess Mononoke is indeed a thing of beauty and imagination.
1.0 With a Luminist's attention to light, water, shadow and smoke, Miyazaki creates an epochal story born of history, myth and Shinto animism.
0.8 This imaginative and intriguing Anime deserves all the plaudits heaped upon it.
1.0 Beautifully constructed and painstakingly written, this is about as close to a perfect animated epic as you're likely to get.
0.875 Anyone who relishes seeing the reach and scope of the genre redefined should not miss this marvelously accomplished picture.
0.875 This highly imaginative and beautifully rendered fable of ancient Japan comes from writer-director-master animator Hayao Miyazaki and is told with the scope and epic flair of the best live-action adventure films.
0.8 The highest-grossing Japanese film of all time is a luxuriously animated legend of ancient gods going head to head with mankind and industry over the balance of nature.
1.0 Hayao Miyazaki is a great animator, and his Princess Mononoke is a great film.
1.0 Watching the way Miyazaki and his animators can make a misty cloud drift across the screen is nothing less than pure bliss.
0.8 It is too ambitious, too sure of its own vastness to love it; it demands respect more than affection.
0.875 A seamless marriage between a mature, complex story ideas and boundless visual imagination.
0.75 Hayao Miyazaki's eco-friendly animated fable about animal gods and those damn humans bent on destroying the environment is made bearable by some trademark anime limb-severing violence.
0.875 Its imagery is never less than breathtakingly beautiful, and is occasionally truly awesome...
1.0 All Miyazaki's films are masterpieces, but Princess Mononoke may just have the edge.
1.0 This web of mixed motives is one of Princess Mononoke's greatest strengths. Not once do we feel that the characters are cardboard cutout villains and their hardships are more powerful as a result.
0.875 Miyazaki's artistry is evident in every frame, a pristine combination of lush greenery, ghastly mythic monsters and beautifully executed humans.
0.7 Some scenes in the film are gory and may scare young children, but older teens and adults should revel in the beautifully realized scenery and the rich characters.
0.875 An animated fable of dazzling artistry, one of the most beautiful ever made.
1.0 As beautiful as it is poignant.
0.875 A wonderful film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, often called the Walt Disney of Japanimation.
0.875 The smartest, most thoughtful, best-made cartoon youa(TM)re likely to see in a long time.
0.75 The imagery, ranging from sublime mountain-smashing power to firefly delicacy (individual waterdrops splashing on a rock) is exuberant and intoxicating.
0.875 Not for the very young, The Princess Mononoke can be stunningly violent at times. But for fans of animation, this is a must see.
0.8 But the film is, on the whole, a full, meaty treat, striking not only in its subject-matter and the approach to it, but also in its pin-sharp detailing of nature and the speed and grace with which the characters move.
0.9 Calling this film a 'kid's film,' however, completely misses the point. It is instead a film for the young at heart and those who still appreciate honor, valor, love, and the earth.
1.0 A breathtaking saga of man versus nature, of gods and men, of bravery, nobility and redemption.
0.875 Unlike most animated motion pictures, which have a relatively limited scope, Princess Mononoke is an epic saga, a fantasy adventure of great ambition and extent.
0.85 Princess Mononoke is a remarkable blend of fantastic imagination and relevant moral questions.
0.6 I was somewhat disappointed by the mundane story it presented, but the fashion in which it presented it made it completely worthwhile.
0.75 Brooding, occasionally bloody and often abstract, it explores animation's dramatic potential in wonderous ways.
0.75 Miyazaki portrays nature with a breathtaking touch.
0.875 This is clearly not a movie for kids under 10, as decapitations and maimings aren't that uncommon and the story is detailed, filled with subplots, and low on cookie-cutter characters and cutesy sidekicks.
0.875 A haunting, beautiful film that holds your attention despite its length and its complex plot.
0.75 It's an art film, a densely plotted and visually stunning piece of animation, and not a movie for everybody.
0.875 Here is a film that reaches for unforeseen heights, and surpasses them.
0.625 Redubbed for American release, this handsome, stirring movie looks and feels spectacular with its incredible watercolors of forest landscapes, its giant and intelligent wild animals and its ancient, epic mythology.
1.0 The result, while not a substitute for the original, will still astound audiences with its mesmerizing vision.
0.875 Hayao Miyazaki has created a world simply unlike any you've seen.
0.8 The 135 minutes that Miyazaki takes to put across his many motifs are deserved considering the complexity of his task and the movie, which avoids repetition despite the many battles, does not fail to entertain.
1.0 Absolutely breathtaking!
0.9 Go in with an open mind, clear your expectations, and let it do its thing. Trust me.
0.8 The film, which runs almost two and a half hours, is paced exceedingly well and never feels too long.
0.7 ...easily one of the best-looking animated features in years.
0.7 It is definitely too much of a good thing.
0.6 The real revelation in the film is the depth and complexity of its mythology and storytelling, which manage to overcome the problems with the human story.
0.5 The movie does have potential, but in its present state it's a disappointment that few will enjoy immensely.
0.5 Sadly, the PVC-clad Nyah is a crashing bore.
0.8 Andrei Tarkovsky's epic inquiry into freedom and faith presents an arduous journey for the spectator, but conjures up its own mystical universe with majestic conviction.
0.8 Seminal feature from Tarkovsky, the master of atmosphere and multi-functional allegory is truly affecting, as well as fodder for countless film studies curricula.
1.0 There is no easy watching to be gained here, but nor is this a hard slog -- each scene is beautifully crafted, painting a vivid and fascinating picture of Tarkovsky's vision.
0.8 A vast prose-poem on celluloid whose forms and ideas were to be borrowed by moviemakers like Lynch and Spielberg.
0.875 [It] has enough hauntingly beautiful images and profound ideas to linger in one's mind.
1.0 A tangled knot of memories, fears, fantasies, nightmares, paradoxical impulses, and a yearning for something that's simultaneously beyond our reach and yet intrinsic to every one of us.
0.8 Tarkovsky majestically creates through editing rather than special effects the unstable universe of the Zone, and amidst the grime and the destruction, summons up moments of pure magic.
0.91 Tarkovsky's allegory's imagery will sere its nightmare images into the deepest, darkest corners of your subconscious.
0.5 Stalker, a somber futuristic fantasy from the Soviet Union, attempts to build an apocalyptic vision out of the most impoverished materials imaginable.
0.875 More obviously a metaphorical construct than Tarkovsky's Solaris, and as a result, a bit less emotionally satisfying.
0.8 it takes a lot of love to enjoy it. Fortunately, there's a lot of fandom crossover between Family Guy and Star Wars.
0.6 Crude humor, pop culture references in animated Jedi spoof.
0.5 At no point does this dual-timeline setup ever feel like one unified project -- the aesthetics of mid-70's era America and the Vague Future Apocalypse are so wildly disparate as to feel like totally different movies.
0.7 I guess I am a sucker for these sort of time travel films, travelling back in time to change the course of history.
0.8 The surprise isn't spectacular set pieces, first-rate CGI or quality performances from an all-star cast. It's the brains behind the brawn: Days of Future Past is a tirelessly creative chunk of blockbuster bravado.
0.7 Although it might lack in the flare of some of its big screen comic book competitors, Days of Future Past does have plenty of "cool stuff" in its arsenal.
0.8 Really, though, this is an excuse to let the all-star casts of the original trilogy and 2011's swinging 60s prequel share the same screen space while the effects crew comes up with nifty new gags and suitably spectacular set pieces.
0.9 X-Men: Days of Future Past has finally found the sense of humour that has been missing from the recent instalments in the series.
0.6 It trots along at a fair old pace, the cast doing a sterling job of keeping straight faces while spouting quasi-scientific gobbledegook.
0.4 The only auteurs guiding the creation of Days of Future Past are the talent agencies that put together the deal.
0.875 Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg deftly move between future and past, presenting the parallel storylines coherently and gracefully.
0.8 The action and effects are handled expertly and as with previous X-Men films and comics, there is speechifying, unlikely alliances, sudden betrayals and the denouement will have fans of the original movies swooning.
0.6 Singer's direction is capable, with generally fulfilling use of 3-D technology and a thankfully dry sense of humour.
0.8 Here's the thing about comic book heroes. Despite all the noble talk about metaphors, idealism, truth and justice, they're basically just bully-boy fantasies of limitless male aggression... The X-Men, however, have always aspired to something different.
0.75 If you include two stand-alone Wolverine films, this is the seventh X-Men-related movie, and any series' movie No. 7 isn't supposed to be as good as this genre film that is full of both grandeur and fun.
0.8 It seems like all the summ er blockbusters this year are coming in spring, but Days of Future Past will surely hold up as one of the year's best.
0.8 ( ... ) one of the stars showboat nor are they overshadowed by the mind-blowing special effects.
0.875 A sublime adventure that deftly juggles character and plot.
0.7 Despite all of its flaws, X-Men: Days of Future Past is incredibly fun ... This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should its audience.
0.5 This is the seventh X-Men film, the fifth team movie, and we're still dealing with the same "Eric says kill the humans before they kill us" vs. "Charles says give peace a chance" plot.
0.75 Shows Singer exercising some much-needed control over the franchise he built 14 years ago and wrangling a lot of loose ends -- a welcome return, and although the material itself is a little unwieldy, it successfully brings together characterizations.
0.75 If you just think of each franchise X-Men film installment as a stand-alone alternative history, it will go easier for your brain.
0.5 I cannot recommend the film to anyone not firmly grounded in X-MEN lore
0.75 With references to Vietnam and with President Nixon as a key supporting character, the film continues the X-Men tradition of being politically and sociologically conscious...
0.8 In a film universe in which it's sometimes challenging to find at least one character to cheer for, this ensemble is loaded with them.
0.9 It lives. It breathes. It has a sense of humor. It is very probably the best comic book movie since Singer gave us X2: X-Men United back in 2003.
0.75 the story's stakes are, despite the familiarly bleak post-apocalyptic setting, inherently more personal and intimate, which makes the film as a whole more emotionally gripping
0.6 The most astoundingly okay movie so far this year - which is apparently all it takes to earn high praise these days.
0.7 It's more like a Roger Moore James Bond movie, maybe even Moonraker but I say that as a Bond fan who appreciates the blatant outrageousness of Moonraker. If Moonraker sounds like an insult, then Days of Future Past is at least Octopussy.
0.8 That Singer fellow sure can make an X-Men movie.
0.7 Wonder of wonders, it has what too many blockbusters lack: villains with motivations beyond "world domination."
0.8 Continuing to be the most original and resonant of the Marvel superhero franchises, the X-men return in the capable hands of director Bryan Singer, who again stirs plenty of meaty subtext beneath the thrilling action.
0.75 ...an erratic yet rewarding entry within this ongoing series.
0.8 Dark, enthralling and undeniably exhilarating, this is the X-Men movie for X-Men aficionados.
0.75 There is never a dull moment here as we watch on, uninterrupted, with constant interest in an ambitious display of paradoxes and riddles.
0.875 The results are both dazzling and intimate, clever and - during one tour-de-force sequence - spectacularly funny.
0.8 Does a fine job of portraying the broad-strokes emotional storytelling that popcorn movies are best at... very fun and very operatic, large and imposing and dazzling.
0.8 ...funny, sharp, and breathlessly paced, and is one of the few films this year that are worth the exuberant price of a current 3D ticket. Bring on X-men: Apocalypse.
0.75 It's significantly better than most of the previous "X-Men" outings.
0.8 At least we can have moments like "Days of Future Past" where the crew that started it all can pop in and remind us of how it is supposed to be done.
1.0 X-Men, a fabled franchise that, like a fine wine, just keeps improving with age.
0.7 While entertaining and bolstered by excellent pan-X-Universe performances, Days of Future Past is a grimmer, less exhilarating chapter in the saga.
0.875 Hits that sweet spot of being really exciting and just substantive enough to earn our engagement. In the comic book-movie realm, it sits comfortably in the upper echelon.
0.6 X-Men: Days of Future Past is full of sound and fury signifying box office.
0.8 A rollicking, if sometimes convoluted, good time, featuring a high-toned cast and a seriousness of purpose that sets it apart from the candy-colored Marvel-produced films and Sony's underwhelming Amazing Spider-Man series.
0.6 More of the same, only bigger, louder and messier as the pretty-good sequel to the very-good 2011 prequel pushes the "franchise extender" mentality currently consuming Hollywood to new extremes.
0.6 There's quite a bit to like about Days of Future Past, but it feels more like a step backward than the creative leap forward that Matthew Vaughn's prequel pointed towards.
0.8 Blockbuster films so often blow so much of their budget on special effects but think of the plot as an afterthought. This one dares to reverse that mistake by investing heavily in its writing and allowing CGI to perfectly complement it.
0.875 It's that kind of movie: knowledgeable, emotional, and packed with incident and excitement.
1.0 In the glut of superhero films flooding theaters these days, the X-Men series stands above the rest.
0.875 Captures the true essence of what has made and will make the X-Men's uncanny popularity survive and thrive in days of future and past.
0.8 This is Mystique's movie. The filmmakers are obviously making the most of Jennifer Lawrence's current star power by putting her right out front for this one.
0.6 A jumble of mutant melodrama that's pleasing but never wholly poignant.
0.8 one of the best X-Men movies ever made
0.7 Amazing what substance in performance can do to distract from the incredible and incredibly silly.
0.375 There's no zip, no driving force, no personality to these movies, other than what the overqualified actors manage to squeeze out of their individual scenes.
0.9 X-Men: Days of Future Past succeeds at being a thrilling and fun superhero movie, balanced by well-earned dramatic weight.
0.75 Quicksilver ... is the coolest of this picture's new guys, zipping around so fast ... that he can taste soup, rearrange guards' limbs, and nudge bullets off their trajectories all in the time it takes to blink.
0.8 Singer not only elevates the action to delight the fans and newcomers but he delivers a fast-paced emotional storyline that blends in all of the previous films without confusing anyone. Certainly a first rate entertainment among the Marvel films to date.
0.8 A pleasingly coherent, plot-driven action movie, positively streamlined by the standards of today's superhero blockbusters.
0.625 Amongst the flying robots and the claws coming out and the ceaseless wisecracks, there isn't really much of a human story to grab on to.
0.8 Singer's clever uses of period style and sound... [provides] an extra dimension, beyond 3D visuals, capable of delivering a larger, deeper, emotional experience because it offers context to the endless, chaotic action.
0.85 [It's] filled to near bursting as its enormous cast scrambles through the vagaries of its time travel paradox-rich design. But Singer threads the needle with such apparent effortlessness in stitching it all together, the seams are practically invisible.
1.0 Simply put, Days of Future Past is the best X-Men yet, a superhero highlight reel that rivals The Avengers' energy and popcorn fun and matches The Dark Knight's brooding tone and memorable arch nemesis.
0.875 The complex movie begins juggling and balancing its storyline with astounding skill, as if its various pieces were made of metal and Magneto himself were in charge.
0.8 With Singer back at the helm and a marvelous cast to boot, "X-Men: Days of Future Past" is the best in the franchise and possibly the best superhero film yet this year.
0.9 "X-Men: Days of Future Past" uses fantastic storytelling and mesmerizing action to become the greatest film any mutants - teenage or otherwise - have ever been a part of.
1.0 Quite simply, "X-Men: Days of Future Past" ensures the legacy of the "X-Men" movies being among the best franchises the comic books have to offer.
0.8 Time-traveling superhero sequel has lots of action violence.
0.6 You'll love it if Marvel comic book movies are your thing. If not, it's a yawner.
0.625 An overplotted conglomeration of events that I found diverting, yet meaningless and emotionally uninvolving.
0.9 Even with its massive cast and its constant transitions between the past and the present, X-Men: Days of Future Past is able to deliver a cohesively brilliant film that is sure to be entertaining for both comic book and movie fans.
0.6 The latest in the series in no way lets down the six that came before, and sets a pretty high bar for the many doubtless yet to come.
0.75 After being burned out on the X-Men for a while, I'd be up for another outing. Maybe in the next film they can head back to the '80s ("Mr. Magneto, tear down this wall!")
0.6 To ensure long-term survival, this franchise needs to evolve. In terms of the competition, however, it's still light years ahead.
0.8 As action-packed as it is, the quiet moments work best and, like 2011's First Class, the superhero universe of the X-Men is a cut above its comparatively cheesier brethren.
0.75 Having already directed the first two (and superior) X-Men films, Singer shows a level of comfort with both the material and the cast ...
0.8 X-Men: Days of Future Past is the smartest and most complicated superhero movie in years.
0.9 You really should see X-Men: Days of Future Past on the big screen. The heart-pumping effects are worth it alone. And the cleverness and wit are outstanding.
0.8 The jailbreak is the film's most giddily entertaining episode... Witty, cheeky and utterly disarming, like mischievous prankster Quicksilver himself, the scene is a delight.
0.8 At its heart the X-Men story is a parable about difference, subjugation and redemption, an alternate history of humanity where justice evolves as the oppressed model the decency and responsible use of power they've been denied.
0.8 Strap yourself in kids, because this is why you go to summer movies. Director Bryan Singer has absolutely nailed Days of Future Past.
1.0 Amazing
0.75 Ambitious, even audacious, the movie's mix of action and for-devotees-only intrigue can overwhelm, but there are moments of sheer virtuosity, too ...
0.7 An audacious, thrilling adventure that's the most epic adventure yet featuring everyone's favorite mutants.
0.8 Bryan Singer has undoubtedly made the best X-Men film since X2, with a great premise that is not only complex and rooted in sci-fi, but one that also manages to correct just about every crappy decision made in X-Men: The Last Stand.
0.875 Even in the Marvel universe, the question of whether we can control our own fate arises. 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is a star-studded, beautifully written film with both smarts and brawn.
1.0 Sequels can offer more of the same stories and characters that made their predecessors so successful or they can dare to be more. This movie dares to be more.
0.625 This is a satisfying entry, to be sure, and perhaps even the most ambitious, but the premise and its hulking ensemble are underused.
0.875 For those who felt The Last Stand was a poor exit for many of these characters, X-Men: Days of Future Past should at least salve the wound in part.
0.6 It is successful because the spectacle never outweighs the story, or more importantly, its characters.
0.6 X-Files, Xbox and X-Men - this brave new world suffers from a surfeit of X's. For those of you who think that X indicates buried treasure this latest instalment is probably best avoided.
0.75 It all builds to a climax that intercuts between past and present, but again, it's not the action ... that keeps us involved.
0.875 In the capable hands of director Bryan Singer, who helmed the first two X-Men films, it's a nearly seamless adventure ride despite a plot that at times strains credulity.
0.75 If you are an "X" maniac, Singer's given you the movie you've been hoping for.
0.75 This deftly scripted and unusually affecting installment of the long-running series is marked by the notable return of director Bryan Singer, who succeeds in delivering a film that ranks among the very best of the franchise.
0.875 Once it reaches takeoff velocity, "Days of Future Past" becomes one of the best installments in the "X-Men" series.
0.75 For all its sociopolitical smarts and coded subtexts, the "X-Men" franchise, based on the Marvel comics, is primarily about entertainment, and this seventh installment is no different.
0.6 Veers between interesting and insipid for much of its running time.
0.8 A summer blockbuster that surges with creative action sequences and memorable characters.
0.8 There are many superhuman feats on display in the latest installment in the X-Men saga, Days of Future Past. Time travel. Saving the world from big, angry robots. A beautifully restored 1973 Buick Riviera.
0.875 Step up, cynics, and see the summer 2014 blockbuster that gets damn near everything right.
0.7 Suspenseful and satisfying sequel/prequel.
0.7 X-Men: Days of Future Past does have its merits. Keeping its mouth shut is not one of them.
0.75 "X-Men: Days of Future Past" upholds the acceptably high batting average of Marvel's second-tier movie franchise.
0.75 The novelty has somewhat worn off after we've been bombarded by six previous "X-Men"/"Wolverine" efforts and umpteen other Marvel flicks. But the talent has never been better than in this rousing adventure.
0.8 Singer keeps tight narrative control over a complicated plot, showcasing his directorial gifts in a magnificent climax that shuttles between two timelines with artistry.
0.5 It only conveys the awesome strangeness of its characters and their universe when director Brian Singer breaks away from the perpetual build-up of the film's unwieldy plot.
0.4 After a chunky, [derivative] opening, Bryan Singer's return to the world of 'Mutants are people too, only better' settles into a '70s-style actor's showcase.
0.75 Some sequels have such a complicated back story they should come with printed footnotes. The latest sequel in the "X-Men" series requires an encyclopedia that can be read in a fun-house mirror.
0.75 Most important, there is an emotional undercurrent in this installment that the earlier films only aspired to.
0.8 A mind-bending thrill ride with great special effects.
0.75 "Days of Future Past" is, in itself, as intoxicating as a shot of adrenaline. It's what summer movies are meant to be.
0.72 It's a brilliant gameplan for a studio: Manipulate time and space to make the X-Men movies infinitely re-bootable, infinitely re-castable and assuredly profitable, until it sounds like, and is, a kind of prayer: Forever and ever, X-Men.
0.8 A giddy rush of superhero thrills, spills and epic set-pieces.
0.9 This is a fantastic movie. It looks great, has very good performances from a whole bunch of actors who I like a lot, and stages action sequences that are both coherent and impressive. The screenplay might be the best part of all
0.75 Singer does a nice job of connecting the bleakness of the '70s with the optimistic spirit that inspired the X-Men in the first place.
0.625 There's just enough right in "Days of Future Past" to off-set what's wrong.
0.9 The film X-Men fans have been waiting for. It lives up to their expectations and then some. A truly epic installment.
0.75 This is the best, most entertaining and mature comic-book Hollywood franchise currently in existence.
0.5 Drab in look and overly talky, X-Men: Days of Future Past lacks the life force and lilt of its 2011 predecessor, X-Men: First Class.
0.6 A dizzying but enjoyable ride.
0.6 In a film at one with its own absurdity, near-camp delirium is the strongest suit.
0.75 Singer, who directed the first X-Men movie 14 years ago, brings back a joyful comic book feel to the series.
0.6 Days of Future Past capitalizes on the audience's familiarity with the many players and their complex backstories, but never advances the ball down the field, tenders no new thought or wrinkle to the franchise.
0.5 A double whammy for those suffering both superhero and time-travel fatigue.
0.7 At its best, Days Of Future Past feels not just like an X-Men comic book, but like an X-Men comic-book crossover
0.8 ... the return of the franchise's prodigal son, Bryan Singer, and Oscar winning screenwriter Simon Kinberg adapting one of the defining X-Men comic arcs; the stars have aligned for the X-Men's answer to The Avengers.
0.8 Something old, something new, some Bolivar, something blue...
0.6 The movie finds a lot of success, largely due to solid work from a lot of extraordinary actors. They maneuver around a jam-packed plot that, in lesser hands, could have left you looking at your watch.
0.7 Both a satisfying capstone for the series so far and a solid starting point for future installments.
0.8 A perfect blend of all-audience sci-fi actioner and fans-only nerd-out.
0.875 What makes [it] more than just a thrilling science-fiction actioner is the past-present poignancy allowed by time travel and astral projection, indulging everyone's fantasy of telling a younger self what he or she needs to hear.
0.875 This could have easily been one of those blockbusters that seemed tantalizing in the crowded hallways of Comic-Con yet resulted in a convoluted disaster. What we have here is an electrifying ride that grips until its last frame.
0.875 The most ambitious and ingenious of the long-running series, X-Men: Days of Future Past keeps the key crew of mutants busier than ever.
0.5 Unfortunately, after initially running hot with breathtaking 3D effects and a fascinating premise, Days Of Future Past gradually cools into an unnecessarily convoluted, compromised product.
0.875 Days of Future Past toys with history, but stays true to its outsider roots, expressing them with conviction and a sense of narrative sure-footedness. Even better, it's timeless fun, a summer movie that engages and entertains us in equal measures.
0.8 "X-Men: Days of Future Past" does just about everything you'd hope an all-star, time-traveling summer blockbuster should.
0.75 [It's got] a lot of plot. And yet, despite resulting in a film that brings together the cast of the original X-Men films and the upstarts of the clever 2011 reboot X-Men: First Class, Singer keeps what matters clear and snappy enough.
0.875 The film is visually exciting, aping the look of period camerawork effectively in several 1970s scenes. The actors aren't overwhelmed by effects for the most part.
0.8 X-cellent, X-citing, X-hilarating!
0.9 Thrilling, heady and not just a little funny, it's easily as good as Singer's other X-films, and rivals the best of the Marvel-based movies to date.
0.6 It all trots along at a brisk pace with genuinely impressive special effects and decent gags. Bryan Singer really cares about his mutant outcasts, weaving just enough drama into the superhero shenanigans.
0.8 The return of Wolverine and many other original X-Men gives a welcome jolt of familiarity to this complex, funny and often spectacular adventure.
0.7 The most enjoyable and unexpected element of the film is Evan Peters as the super-speedy yet laid-back mutant teen Quicksilver.
0.875 "X-Men: Days of Future Past'' blows a breath of fresh air through the musty Marvel universe, which increasingly is all about pandering to hard-core fans rather than trying to make good movies for everybody.
0.75 The first "fun" summer blockbuster and maybe the best X-Men movie yet.
0.75 It isn't the best of the series but it lets fans enjoy younger and older versions of some of the characters and play in this corner of the Marvel Universe.
1.0 Traz alguns dos melhores momentos de toda a franquia.
0.8 Perhaps the most astonishing thing is that this movie is as elegant as it is.
0.6 X-Men movies: always promising, never fulfilling... "Ooh, look at how well the production was scheduled," we'll whisper to one another, feeling nothing else at all.
0.8 Dancing between the fun and the all-out ridiculous with surprisingly nimble feet, X-Men: Days of Future Past is an absolute blast.
0.8 A bold, dark and important chapter in a superhero franchise that continues to evoke the past atrocities of man, in order to portray a fantastic fable of hope amidst hopeless times.
0.8 It's all such rollicking fun it's hard to care about the occasional baffling moment.
0.6 It's a character-driven comics movie that mostly forgets about the characters as characters.
0.8 What we do get here is largely fantastic, not only re-energising old-favourite characters but introducing intriguing new ones.
0.4 The problem here is an absurdly convoluted screenplay that leaps back and forth in time in a manner that is both confusing and increasingly irritating.
0.6 With the principal players all on top form, some arresting set pieces and a nice mix of humour and drama, Days of Future Past does more than enough to overcome its imperfections and keep fans satisfied.
0.8 Largely derivative but without feeling lazy, this is an X-outing that takes the best elements of the previous films, particularly the plot of X2, and rehashes it all through a hue of darkness.
0.8 With style, heart and thrills, Singer has nailed the most ambitious X-flick yet. Popcorn pizzazz combines with X2's emotional sweep and something extra: a platform for the X-Men's screen survival.
0.8 That it all makes sense and is up there with the best X-movies is actually quite uncanny.
0.8 A perfectly fine follow-up to X-Men: First Class and a nice way to offer some closure for Bryan Singer's earlier X-men movies.
0.6 For all its ambitious plotting, this X-Men is really an effective merger of the franchise's two separate incarnations ...
0.8 It's a film that serves as a prequel, a sequel and a bridge between the two. And, most of all, it serves as a giant "f ... you" to X-Men: The Last Stand.
0.8 Striking in its ambition, assured in its execution, and compelling throughout.
0.8 One of the best films in this admittedly slapdash series.
0.9 The best, most complete and most entertaining X-Men movie we've ever seen.
0.4 A curate's egg, thoroughly scrambled.
0.8 A powerful cocktail of nostalgia and new frontier - quite simply it's the grandest, most ambitious X-Men movie yet.
0.4 Jaw-droppingly awful -- mesmerizingly so. Poor Joe Cotten.
0.125 painfully stupid
1.0 Com uma fabulosa direcao de arte, uma animacao expressiva e temas complexos, o filme representa um estimulo visual, intelectual e emocional intenso, resultando numa experiencia fascinante.
0.4 One of the most beautiful animated films ever produced.
0.8 Metropolis se veut une %u0153uvre impressionnante, a la hauteur des noms qui lui sont rattaches.
0.6 Doubling up on the imagery makes for an interesting, though ultimately somewhat unfulfilling, experience.
0.8 One of the most important animated films ever made.
0.9 One of the best animated films I have ever seen, and it is one of the finest films released in the US last year.
0.8 In the end, the story doesn't really matter that much as this is really a vehicle for the amazing visuals.
0.78 If you are a fan of animation you'll want to watch it more than once.
0.6 For something as splendid-looking as this particular film, the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash.
1.0 ...a haunting vision, with images that seem more like disturbing hallucinations.
0.75 A visionary marvel, but it's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this.
0.875 With elements cribbed from Lang's Metropolis, Welles' Kane, and Eisenstein's Potemkin, the true wonder of Rintaro's Metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own.
0.625 The movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime, and the fanatical excess built into it.
0.75 There's so much to look at in Metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles.
0.74 The visuals alone make Metropolis worth seeing.
0.8 One of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old Walt doodled Steamboat Willie.
0.5 The story suffers a severe case of oversimplification, superficiality and silliness.
0.75 Unlike most anime, whose most ardent fans outside Japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes, Metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile.
0.6 Brings together some of the biggest names in Japanese anime, with impressive results.
0.8 A jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every cliche of Japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage.
0.875 Has an almost stupefyingly intense visual impact.
0.875 A fast-moving and remarkable film that appears destined to become a landmark in Japanese animation.
0.75 Melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting, and always a beauty to behold.
0.75 Suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative. Still, as a visual treat, the film is almost unsurpassed.
0.75 The urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks, and the color palette, with lots of somber blues and pinks, is dreamy and evocative.
0.75 Each frame of Metropolis is steeped in Tezuka's delectably strange retro-future vision.
0.5 The dialogue is dubbed into English by generic actors, whose phony, emotionless rendition undermines what's on the screen.
1.0 One of the best animated films I have ever seen.
0.7 A hallucinatory tour de force of color, perspective and scale, virtually encapsulates the history of Japanese animation.
0.6 Stunningly beautiful.
1.0 Belleza, magia, poder, amor, misterio, y gran gran msica y visuales... qu ms se puede pedir?...
0.75 The scene-stealer is Robert Ryan, one of cinema's forgotten great actors. He delivers a superlative performance as the radical with dark reason and fearful purpose, bringing a new, almost heroic dimension to the character.
0.7 The play is an inescapably great experience, and that fact isn't muffled by this film.
1.0 For four hours we live in these two rooms and discover the secrets of these people, and at the end we have gone deeper, seen more, and will remember more, than with most of the other movies of our life.
1.0 Shocking in its day and still a genuinely creepy experience, director James Whale's primitive yet enthralling interpretation of Mary Shelley's classic tale of man playing God is the most influential genre movie ever made.
0.625 ...a watchable yet consistently uneven horror flick that feels long even at 70 minutes...
1.0 Classic monster movie still electrifies.
0.87 Frankenstein is a horror film that turns (miraculously) into an existential tale of man's fear of abandonment
0.9 If it isn't the best American horror film of the 1930s, that's only because the extremely gifted director James Whale wasn't done with the franchise quite yet.
1.0 Beautiful photography, a heartbreaking story, and iconic moments from beginnning to end. Absolutely unmissable.
0.875 A classic.
0.7 Now a classic part of scream culture.
0.8 The high tide of Universal horror. Hail Karloff.
0.8 Charming, spooky, and magical at once.
1.0 An essential classic.
1.0 Here Whale emerges in full flower%u2014the stage director in love with the theatrical and drunk on the possibilities of film.
0.9 Genuine old-school horror movie excellence ... and the sequel is even better!
1.0 Nothing can detract from the power of the most influential monster movie ever made.
0.9 Still a startling film about the borders between genius and madness, science and atrocity.
0.875 As much as the later movies diluted the character of the Frankenstein creature, nothing could blunt the impact made by Karloff in the role of the most memorable movie monster of all time.
1.0 James Whale's extravagantly produced sequel to his own Frankenstein still ranks as one of horrordom's greatest achievements.
1.0 A riveting, funny, and suspenseful horror classic.
1.0 This was to be [director James Whale's] last horror film. Small wonder; what could he possibly have left to prove?
1.0 A must for anyone with even a passing interest in horror, this not only confirms Karloff as a master of the genre, but also shows, more than any of Whale's subsequent films, the influence of his vision.
1.0 Whale's erudite genius brings it all together. He sculpts every nuance of self-parody, social satire, horror, humour, wit and whimsy into a dazzling whole, keeping every one of his fantastical plates spinning until the tragic, inevitable finale.
1.0 one of the greatest movies i've ever seen
1.0 Classic - the pinnacle of Universal horror
0.8 My Big Fat Monster Wedding.
1.0 Absolute classic horror, the best of the 'Frankensteins.'
1.0 Among the best of what Hollywood has to offer.
0.9 A horror mega-classic.
1.0 One of the best horror SEQUELS ever made.
1.0 A perfect mix of comedy and tragedy.
1.0 Whale brings camp humor to this immortal sequel without losing the horror or the pathos which the tale demands.
1.0 Grand, spectacular entertainment: a blend of horror and black comedy carried along by Whale's unique combination of theater and cinematic fireworks.
0.9 THE monster movie.
1.0 The Bride of Frankenstein has an in-your- face audacity that hasn't dimmed all that much after 63 years.
1.0 A classic, much better than the relatively straightforward original.
1.0 One of the oddest and most memorable films ever made in America.
1.0 Seen today, Whale's masterpiece is more surprising than when it was made because today's audiences are more alert to its buried hints of homosexuality, necrophilia and sacrilege. But you don't have to deconstruct it to enjoy it.
0.5 ...grows more and more complicated and convoluted as time progresses...
0.9 Enjoys a visual richness and narrative ambition virtually unheard of in animation prior to its release.
0.75 Once again, Miyazaki's entry is nothing short of spectacular.
0.875 Nausicaa, princess of the Valley of the Wind, is a screen heroine--or, rather, hero--for the ages.
0.7 For all its inventiveness, it doesn't really compare to Miyazaki's later pictures.
1.0 It's a delight.
0.875 At once enchanting and emboldening...
1.0 It is the most dynamic animated film ever made, and the prance of its camera, the sense of penetration into its action, the brilliantly paced editing pyrotechnics give it a crackle of life far more abundant than any feature that's come before.
1.0 It's cartoon Cocteau, but just look at the children's faces as they watch it.
0.875 It's exceptionally difficult to make an audience care for animated characters unless they're mermaids or anthropomorphized animals or insects, yet the Disney animators, with a big assist from the vocal talents of a superb cast, have pulled it off.
0.75 Beauty and the Beast is certainly adequate holiday entertainment for children and their more indulgent parents... But the film has little of the technical facility, vivid characterization and emotional impact of Disney past.
1.0 Remains as wondrous and beautiful as ever.
1.0 Pure fairytale escapism that doesn't boast any digital trickery, celebrity voiceovers or unnecessary action.
1.0 Disney's most perfectly achieved combination of animation, story-telling and song must surely be this loving tribute to the old fairytale.
0.6 There's no doubting the craftsmanlike elegance of the film, summoning up with relish the spirit of classic fairytale Disney of the 50s and 60s...
0.8 Unsubtle perhaps, but never fails to hit the right notes.
0.8 Magic.
1.0 Reaches a level of artistry, sophistication and musical excellence that's still to be bettered by the Mouse House - or indeed its rivals.
1.0 The greatest animated film ever made and one of the screen's great musicals hardly needs this (3D) sort of sprucing up.
1.0 I admit it: I wrote this more than 20 years ago. But, like " Beauty and the Beast" itself, I think it stands the test of time.
1.0 Disney, please understand ... what people are actually showing up for ... they just want to see classic Disney on the big screen. The 3D is incidental.
0.9 Watching this in a theater definitely makes it feel less like a "cartoon" and more like a significant film. Cogsworth poking Le Fou in the butt with a sword aside.
1.0 One of the brightest jewels in Disney's crown, Beauty and the Beast's 3D reissue takes nothing away and makes the film's brilliance even easier to appreciate; the movie is more beautiful and timeless than it ever was.
0.75 The lines have begun to show in Belle's tale, which remains enjoyable but feels more like a quaint artifact than the masterpiece it once was declared to be.
0.8 Both TANGLED EVER AFTER and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST are sure to enthrall audiences everywhere, even if the 3D doesn't really add much of anything to this animated classic.
0.75 What you gain in an extra, faked dimension you lose in lively, genuine beauty.
1.0 The 3-D pops out to enhance the drama or energy of scenes in which settings are large and integral to the action.
0.6 Beauty and the Beast looks beautiful and is sure to entertain, but this experience is superfluous at best-it was already a three-dimensional story long before these new technics.
0.375 Better remembered than seen, Beauty and the Beast has been treated unkindly not just by the years that have passed since it was released to enormous acclaim in 1991, but by a faddish 3D conversion.
1.0 The ultimate makeover story has strong, positive messages.
0.75 ...an above average (yet far-from-flawless) animated endeavor.
1.0 With its strong characters and lively storytelling, animated or not, this deserves its place alongside the cinema greats.
1.0 As far as "Classic Disney," Beauty and the Beast pretty much has it all. Y'know, for kids. [Blu-ray]
1.0 A classic story of redemption, love, purity and friendship - a film worthy of our love and attention.
0.9 This beloved 1991 film has never looked better, and seems even more magical in Blu-ray.
1.0 Beauty and the Beast is one of the year`s most entertaining films for both adults and children.
1.0 This isn't merely the best of the princess features; it's very close to being the best Disney movie of them all.
1.0 A dramatic, comic, exciting, suspenseful, joyous, and robustly magical adventure that has the bracing feel of a 3-D movie at times and approaches sensory overload.
1.0 Some of the film's ideas, which are both campy and subtle, may not be kids' stuff, but like all good movies, Disney's enchanting fairy tale operates on many different levels and thus can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.
1.0 The best of all the Disney cartoons
0.625 Belle is so decidedly positive in every regard, so simplistically shaped to meet the desires of all audience members (both dreamy little girls and feminist objectors), that she ultimately fails as a character
0.375 She falls for a hot-tempered manimal, but is it any coincidence that he showers her with gifts the whole time?
1.0 The artistry of the animators, who combined traditional painting with computer-generated images, stands up to the best that the Disney empire ever produced.
0.9 ...filled with charm, wit, romance, humor, and plenty of songs and music.
0.7 Not quite the masterpiece we once thought.
0.9 Revoke my Cynic Badge if you must, but I say this one comes real close to the Disney Classics of yore. (I said "close!")
1.0 Una obra maestra que los hara reir, llorar, emocionarse y pensar que la vida, aunque solo sea por unos momentos, es maravillosa.
1.0 The finest Disney feature-length animated musical ever made
1.0 Ten years later, it's still flawed and still quite fascinating.
0.9 A nostalgic feast, drawing shamelessly on the best traditions of screen animation and American musical theater and film. Thoroughly derivative but thoroughly charming.
0.8 It's not an especially scary movie, but right from the start, you can tell that this Beauty and the Beast has a beauty of a bite.
1.0 For once, the Disney hyperbole was right--the film is, indeed, a timeless cinema classic.
0.875 Entirely captivating from beginning to end -- INTERVIEW w/Director Kirk Wise.
1.0 It may be a cliche to call a fairy tale enchanting, but no other adjective suffices as the film still has the wit, slapstick, and romance to enrapture children and adults alike.
1.0 This is the only animated film ever nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, and you'll see why.
0.7 The new version is amazingly sharp with backgrounds that look like Impressionist paintings.
1.0 Slipped around all my roadblocks and penetrated directly into my strongest childhood memories, in which animation looked more real than live-action features.
1.0 Not only the finest animated movie ever made, but deserves a prominent position on any list of all-time greats.
0.6 A thing of beauty for our kids, something they deserve.
0.75 If you don't have kids, go anyway.
0.1 Do not ever rent this film.
0.4 Time-travel pirate adventure with boy hero, guns, swords.
0.125 There are many things to make fun of here.
0.1 From any angle this is a very ill-considered project -- an obvious contender for worst film of the year.
0.2 The emphasis placed on indoctrination, enslavement and superior alien intelligence brings the film troublingly close to subliminal propaganda, while the script is so banal you'd have to be brainwashed to enjoy it.
0.4 Solid, old-fashioned rollocking adventure? You can keep telling yourself that, but you'd be better off saving the cash, going home and watching Star Wars on video again instead.
0.0 One of the darkest, ugliest, most uninvolving and incomprehensible major-studio fantasies I've ever seen.
0.375 There's so much to mock in Battlefield Earth, it's hard to know where to start.
0.25 The film starts well with interesting comic book-style camera angles, but it never generates enough tension due to preposterous plot holes and liberal borrowings from other movies.
0.125 Battlefield Earth is like taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time. It's not merely bad; it's unpleasant in a hostile way.
0.2 Worst example of vanity filmmaking in years.
0.2 There's really nothing here you haven't seen before, except maybe the sight of John Travolta walking around with tubes in his nose.
0.2 If you are looking for something to hate and despise, get thee to this movie.
0.2 A folly so supreme that it occasionally inspires awe, in the sense that so many people spent so much time and money on it without ever realizing how awful it is.
0.0 Place it next to The Omega Code and The Omega Code shines.
0.0 Blame this mess on Travolta.
0.5 If this is what we have to look forward to in the year 3000, count me out.
0.0 The sets are laughably cheap, and the aliens look like geeks from a Star Trek convention who couldn't afford to buy the "good" Klingon costumes
0.3 This film maintains a surprising consistency of bad acting and directing almost from the first frame to the last.
0.1 AAAAAAAAGHHHH! MY EYES! IT BURNS! IT BURNS!
0.25 Just too absurd to pay full price to see in a theater.
0.375 It's as if Travolta wanted to destroy his career again just to see if he could stage another comeback.
0.0 finds (Travolta) wobbling around in the highest platform shoes since Elton John and sporting bizarre dreadlocks... the oddest vanity production imaginable, one in which the main attraction is nearly impossible to recognize.
0.0 Utterly inane and innocuous in the most harmless, uninteresting way -- the fruit of an overrated star's overblown ego, recklessly indulged by studio excess.
0.2 O diretor Roger Christian acredita que 'ter estilo' e simplesmente inclinar sua camera o tempo todo.
0.5 Ah, it ain't really that terrible.
0.4 You never care about anyone as they give their lives to save humanity. Ho hum. That's the worst crime in this otherwise so-bad-it's-good mess.
0.5 The story is quite weak, with the pace all over the place.
0.2 Every bit as bad as its reputation implies.
0.0 Clearly, at no point did anyone say, "Man, this is a steaming pile of hangover dung - why don't we fix it?"
0.2 A botched adventure that looks suspiciously like any number of other sci-fi tales you will have seen, and pales instantly by the comparison.
0.25 Legions of science-fiction fans will feel compelled to approach the ticket booth and scream for a refund.
0.25 Travolta's performance isn't even bad enough to be campy; it's just bad.
0.6 The end result is a high-budget star vehicle with big special effects that looks in every other way like any one of over a hundred other nameless low-budget post-Apocalyptic science fiction movies that have been made in the last 30 years or so.
0.625 Is it worth seeing once? Sure.
0.7 Despite starting off like a bad Star Trek episode, this film eventually graduates to a higher level.
0.125 Looking back on this film, I can't find anything nice to say about it.
0.4 A disaster of epic proportions.
0.125 John Travolta and Forest Whitaker do some Hollywood slumming in this tenement of a sci-fi thriller. (10-year-olds may enjoy.)
0.25 Is it as bad as advertised? Oh yes, very much so.
0.625 The characters are so deliciously absurd.
0.3 They brought it into existence, this hellbeast of a movie, this monstrosity, this slap in the face of all that is good and right and beautiful and sweet and gentle. Oh, the humanity! Hide the children's eyes!
0.39 Travolta and his fellow bad guy (played by Forest Whitaker) spend an inordinate amount of time cackling and showing off poor oral hygiene.
0.1 Now that it's finally on the screen, we discover that the science-fiction epic Travolta considered a Holy Grail is silly junk.
0.25 A pretty terrible film.
0.2 If you are the type of person who likes to watch traffic accidents, then this is for you.
0.3 Didn't anyone stand up at a production meeting to say that the script is idiotic? That the movie steals unashamedly from countless other sci-fi movies?
0.25 A noisy, chaotic, sloppily edited and embarrassingly banal and derivative saga.
0.4 The movie is so outrageously, spectacularly, unbelievably bad that we stare at it with some sort of appalled curiosity. It fails on so many levels that it's fascinating, although not so much that I'd sit through it again.
0.375 Deeply dumb, depressingly derivative and just plain nonsense.
0.0 Simply put, Battlefield Earth is the worst film I've seen in over 10 years, and believe me, that's saying a lot.
0.5 The movie plays like an uglier, Earth-bound Star Wars, interrupted by frequent Psychlo temper tantrums.
0.0 It's so unbelievably and egregiously bad, you have to wonder if they did it on purpose.
0.2 Battlefield Earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior.
0.0 Battlefield Earth bathes in a pool of utter ridiculousness and cheesy visual styles, then stands up expecting everyone to admire it
0.125 The leader bares a resemblance to Andy Rooney of 60 Minutes, eyebrows and all. It would have been apropos for him to look into the camera and say, 'Don't you just hate it when you waste money on really stupid movies with cheesy special effects?'
0.0 I hated this movie, and I had a great time doing it.
0.125 It's probably obvious by now that Battlefield Earth is far from cerebral or anything even remotely serious.
0.5 Battlefield Earth is long and tedious.
0.2 So overwrought, overacted and overwhelmingly inept that it must be seen to be believed.
0.25 While the look is cool -- like a tinted B&W film, all washes of green, blue, amber and red -- the story's broad strokes are painfully cliched and its details make no sense at all.
0.5 The plot depends on the most ludicrous decisions and senseless actions ever made by a thinking race.
0.375 The only people this film could recruit are members of the rock band Kiss, who, with their high-heeled boots and face paint, might figure they've got a spot if this alien thing ever really came down.
0.3 It will no doubt take a place of honor in the proud pantheon of 'What Were They Thinking?' cinema, right alongside The Postman and Howard the Duck.
0.2 As for the allegation that this boring movie will recruit youth -- I doubt it!
0.2 Christian has chosen ... the sneaky trick ... of making ... the film ... so ... plodding ... that you'll leave ... the theater ... wondering ... whether ... 1,000 years ... have ... passed ... since ... you ... went ... in.
0.0 It can stand as the quintessential example of big moviemaking ineptitude.
0.0 A disaster of epic proportions!
0.0 I cannot help but think that maybe [Travolta's] laughing that he was able to sucker people into pouring millions of dollars toward making such an unspeakable waste.
0.6 A fine little fable of business world mores that has the gross misfortune to turn into a horror film at a time when nobody quite knew what horror was.
0.875 Mike Nichols' underrated 1994 hybrid not only of wolf and man, but also of satire and horror...an eccentric film that may well be regarded, decades hence, as a movie classic. [Blu-ray]
0.6 With the always edgy, slightly demonic, and predictably unpredictable Jack Nicholson as the wolf man, it actually works . . . almost.
0.8 Worth it to see Nicholson the wolf in fang-to-fang battle.
0.8 Up until the rote ending, an elegant and witty take on the werewolf story.
0.8 On the surface a literate werewolf thriller, the subtext of Mike Nichols' Wolf is a sharp critique about what it takes to succeed in the cutthroat corporate world.
0.4 Plenty of Howl, Little Bite
0.4 Cerebral werewolf yarn that just doesn't work.
0.4 Never succeeds in recreating the classics.
0.6 'Jack Nicholson as a lycanthrope' is an interesting pitch, and it makes for a decent enough film.
0.6 A different approach to the werewolf saga, aided by Nicholson's bizarre performance
0.79 It is movies like Wolf that reinvigorate the movie fan lurking inside us all, showing us that commercial and artistic success can truly coexist in modern cinema.
0.75 An excellent movie directed by Mike Nichols.
0.4 Nichols tries mightily to put a new spin on a very old tale, but try as he might, he never gets much off the ground.
0.6 Nicholson as a werewolf is kind of redundant, isn't it?
0.625 Monster movies are supposed to frighten the audience; this one fails utterly in that arena.
0.75 Most of the way, Wolf is quite satisfying, and Nicholson is in top form.
0.75 It's a wonderfully entertaining and beautifully performed film.
0.75 An effective attempt to place a werewolf story in an incongruous setting, with the closely observed details of that setting used to make the story seem more believable.
0.3 The Promise is an over-wrought and laughably goofy film, an empty and pale imitation of the far better films that have gone on before it.
0.7 Faustian bargain with a goddess. Huge armies march. Men out-race the wind. Assassins make devious plots. Spectacular scenes generated largely in computers.
0.25 A queer camp classic.
0.75 A fairy tale for adults that allows the viewer to inhabit an entirely different world, and in doing so, becomes an exercise of the imagination.
0.5 Beautiful but slight.
0.4 An epic fantasy that tries to outdo Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but doesn't touch us emotionally.
0.375 Chen Kaige may seriously think he's creating film art in his empty Promise, but he's best at slinging bull, lots of them.
0.75 if you can plant your tongue in your cheek and accept the exuberant goofiness of the special effects, "The Promise" actually turns out to be a decently entertaining slash-and-kick flick.
0.5 Just about everything is choppy.
0.4 This isn't nearly as good as it claims to be.
0.625 The finale [is] literally a deus ex machina, which will thrill classic-lit majors but leave everyone else feel cheated.
0.5 Flimsy, fake-looking weaponry, bad wigs, grandiose scoring, overacting, simplistic dialogue, illogically elaborate staging, and a plot that goes out of its way to be predictable...
0.625 Chen's tale of mythic chivalry is filled with beautifully designed sets, lovingly detailed costumes and elaborate martial-arts sequences. Unfortunately, it also sports amateurish digital effects that often mar the beauty of this world.
0.625 With The Promise Chen Kaige has proven enough of a professional that he can make the product. But he remains too much of an artist not to scribble on his signature.
0.5 Chen's strength seems to be more with character-driven stories; here's hoping that his next film returns to more comfortable ground.
0.25 Laden with a plot that could generously be called silly or, less forgivingly, stupid, it never achieves lift-off despite numerous scenes of warriors doing battle in midair.
0.5 Everyone is a maximal design statement plugged into volatile action and pretty scenery, but it might be the deluxe origami folding of a silk diaper, its myth-telling so primal as to seem childish.
0.7 It's another intriguing entry in the sometimes wacky, often wonderful world of kung-fu fantasy.
0.5 It's a colorful, kaleidoscopic film, but it's also far too obvious that the actors are standing in front of green screens.
0.5 Gorgeous costumes, elaborate fights and the illusion of swooning romance don't amount to very much if you don't care about any of the characters for a single second.
0.75 Simply in terms of its visual poetry, the exhilarating effects of image upon image of dazzling impossibility, The Promise is not to be missed.
0.75 [The film elicits] the wide-eyed joy of seeing hundreds of soldiers ride through sets of colossal extravagance. And the sweet release of, briefly, suspending all holds on reality or even logic -- and surrendering to the joys of a fairy tale.
0.125 The Promise employs laughable computer effects and second-rate martial-arts fighting to tell the hard-to-figure story of a princess and her three lovers.
0.625 There's a studied artificiality and painterliness about the backgrounds that works nicely with a story that's about as far from realism as you can get. For many that will be enough. For the rest of us, The Promise slowly slides into an exercise.
0.625 Overwrought and hokey.
0.6 Fish gotta fly, birds gotta swim, and arthouse directors gotta try their hands at mega-budget action films.
0.625 As is evident by the film's strong start and faltering finale, the trouble with any promise is failing to keep it.
0.75 In the midst of such unrelenting splendour, it's easy to nod gratefully -- and then to nod off.
0.5 Much of The Promise resembles a Cirque du Soleil extravaganza, which makes it tough to take seriously.
0.5 Perhaps the least-satisfying of the many martial-arts/costume dramas that have followed in the wake of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
0.625 It's impossible not to be bowled over by the magnificent costumes, the atmospheric otherworldly sets and the lush cinematography. The tragic, nearly operatic love isn't nearly as impressive.
0.625 Oddly, The Promise -- which takes place hundreds, even thousands, of years ago, when art directors ruled the earth -- is flagrantly otherworldly but in a way that somehow weighs the picture down.
0.5 [Chen Kaige] reaches for big ideas about destiny and free will, but those remain philosophical abstractions. (And by the end, the film contradicts itself.)
0.4 One can only hope that Chen takes this as a learning experience and returns to the kind of artistry with which he first forged his very deserved reputation.
0.5 It suggests that talented Chinese directors are being led astray by the seductions of CGI and wirework fantasies.
0.375 A mess of a movie.
0.625 In this era of obsessive and globally connected cult cinema fans, it's foolish to give the movie's core target audience an excuse to skip the theatrical experience for the more 'authentic' home edition available uncut on import DVD.
0.0 It is such a catastrophic failure that it is amazing to consider it was ever allowed out of China and into the global cinemas.
0.625 It's not exactly high art, nor is it zippy fun, but it definitely has something, a lack of pretentiousness perhaps?
0.4 barely delivers the goods necessary for the genre
0.6 Fans of newer Asian martial-arts movies will be satisfied with The Promise, especially because it contains the aerial wirework and swordplay expected of such movies. But the film is not as accomplished as the work of Ang Lee or Yimou Zhang.
0.5 The Promise is far too convoluted, jarringly shifting from fantasy to comedy to tragic romance to war epic without warning, never settling in one place.
0.6 A lavish spectacle somewhere between grand opera and cartoon about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess.
0.375 The producers should have allocated part of their huge budget for a couple of script polishes.
0.375 A princess with a curse, a case of mistaken identity and some of the worst special effects in a film by a world-class director.
0.5 The over-the-top acting is forgivable, but the plot's incoherence is not.
0.375 Chen Kaige's fall from cinematic grace is writ large across his latest epic film, the failed martial-arts romantic drama The Promise.
0.25 The Promise has gorgeous visuals (in these movies, the cherry trees are always in bloom). But it's marred by stuttery storytelling and cruddy special effects.
0.5 A messy fairy tale that speaks to tainted ambition and destiny.
0.625 That Chen is able to somewhat collect himself and the film toward the end just highlights how potentially great the film could have been.
0.9 It's a knockout that works on many levels.
0.6 A little tastier but still far from a gourmet feast.
0.25 Despite some gratuitous allusions to Gitmo, the third-rate effects and the two-bit characters make this a summer wipeout.
0.3 When Jessica Alba was at the MTV Movie Awards she called Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer the best family/comedy of the summer. That alone should spell disaster for a superhero film.
0.5 It doesn't suck. Or maybe I went into the theater with such low expectations that it couldn't possibly be as bad as my imagination had concocted.
0.6 While the gags are aimed squarely at a family audience, there's nothing wrong with that and this is certainly a film you could take even tiddlers to without worrying they are going to have nightmares later.
0.5 Can't anyone in comic book movies come up with new villains anymore?
0.4 This sequel is out, overall succumbing to the weaknesses of the first movie, which, once again, relegates it to sitting at the kids' table at the gathering of comic book movies.
0.6 Much better than the first; OK for tweens and up.
0.4 For a film that's supposed to be playful, it's an awful, tedious drudge.
0.375 Characters to love, story to hate.
0.8 I have read many of the legitimate criticisms of this sequel, and I agree with them, and I do not care.
0.75 As the Surfer rises, so too does this franchise.
0.625 While not entirely fantastic, this Four is fun, fast-paced, and family friendly.
0.4 A merciful dearth of plot in favor of mindless set pieces, so-so effects work and passable PG-rated humor.
1.0 With the wedding ruined and the future of the world at stake, it's showtime. Suddenly, Tim Story goes CGI crazy delivering scene after scene of edge-of-your-seat action that will make your eyeballs bleed.
0.3 While it might be better than the first one, it still sucks.
0.4 The film's effects people perform many miracles, from draining the River Thames to ensuring that the Thing produces a convincing smile. But one thing they can't do is to make the unfailingly wholesome Mr Fantastic and friends worth worrying about.
0.3 Rise of the Silver Surfer is both relentlessly dull and curiously bombastic.
0.4 Uma experiencia consideravelmente melhor do que o original %u2013 o que, na pratica, e o mesmo que dizer que e "melhor" ser abocanhado por um leao faminto do que por dois.
0.4 somehow Jessica Alba's acting has taken a turn for the worse, and Chris Evans has the audacity to only take his shirt off for three seconds
0.7 The silver surfer is an outstanding competitor for sci-fi superhumanity's best concepts and affords the series a sweeping interplanetary scale.
0.375 The makers of the franchise better find something more interesting for their four heroes to do -- and quick.
0.6 It's PG-rated summer popcorn fluff at its best, and while the new additions might irritate the hardcore FF fanatics, those simply looking for a check-your-brain-at-the-door night out at the movies will certainly surf away satisfied.
0.625 Slightly improved over the original, Rise of the Silver Surfer provides some better-than-average visual effects, but an inconsequential plot.
0.166666666667 The performances are plywooden, the cornball visual gags are groanworthy, and Tim Story still can't direct his way out a sack with a map.
0.6 Fantastic fun.
0.6 ...[this] second episode could hardly help being an improvement.
0.125 Anything more would be cheating the great wide swaths of gibbering no-brow-bia: the baseball-cap-askew-nation, text-messaging their way through the dead spots.
0.4 click for full review
0.6 Impressive not because of anything that's said, but for the realization that you're watching the screen be dominated by Jessica Alba and a piece of CGI without ever once experiencing the urge to gnaw through your own shoulder.
0.5 If ever a film franchise needed to come equipped with a Reboot button, it's this one.
0.7 Far more entertaining and ambitious than its predecessor, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a surprisingly effective summer movie and a huge improvement over the lackluster 2005 original.
0.4 The good news is that it doesn't think it's Shakespeare, Citizen Kane and grand opera all rolled into one. The bad news is that it still isn't any good.
0.75 Rise of the Silver Surfer isn't a huge improvement, and it doesn't even try to reinvent the wheel, but its minor upgrades here and there make a cumulative difference.
0.5 With its goofy-ass combat scenes and sitcom-level dialogue, Rise of the Silver Surfer is aimed squarely at the 12-and-under crowd.
0.5 Once again, the action feels pedestrian, the special effects simply aren't that special and the acting is nearly nonexistent.
0.375 ...the movie has all the depth of a video game. These aren't people. They're not even interesting characters. They're game pieces.
0.0 The worst comic book adaptation since, well, since Fantastic Four 1. An unimaginative disaster that takes forever to end, as if the celluloid is being stretched by Mr. Fantastic to make the movie last ten times longer than ninety minutes.
0.2 Surfer is just as lousy on every level as its predecessor.
0.375 It's still not fantastic. But I wouldn't be surprised if, eventually, there weren't four of these.
0.4 Sure, the CGI work is all pro and the Silver Surfer effect is a cool visual but the dumb lines and forced chemistry just don't cut it.
0.7 Capably blends action, sci-fi and comedy into one colorful concoction.
0.625 Maintains the tongue-in-cheek quality of the first film without falling into camp.
0.5 The dialogue is dumb drivel, the acting is atrocious and the bodaciously buff title character looks like a shiny hood ornament.
0.7 With a livelier script and stronger production values, this sequel far outdoes the 2004 original.
0.5 Yet another disappointing sequel in a summer filled with far too many of them.
0.5 But for the second film, Story and company have smartly turned to one of Marvel's most intriguing characters, the Silver Surfer (body by Doug Jones, voice courtesy of Laurence Fishburne).
0.75 Rise is exactly what a superhero movie should be: an entertaining, family-friendly popcorn flick with even doses of humor, heroism and heart.
0.5 As far as minor triumphs go, at least Story's disposable film is shrewd enough to understand, embrace, and then stay true to its iconic comic book source material's lighthearted spirit.
0.72 It's interesting how societal change is reflected in movies. Not long ago, a mainstream movie wouldn't have portrayed the legitimate U.S. military openly torturing a prisoner.
0.7 If you liked the first Fantastic Four film, you'll probably enjoy the sequel even more.
0.75 Fantastic? Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration. Thrilling, engaging and totally adequate are more fitting adjectives to the latest superhero special effects bonanza.
0.375 The series needs to find its place or just give up.
0.75 Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a vast and significant improvement -- if not quite "fantastic," then the next best thing: It does not suck.
0.5 If not entirely a downer, this is no topper.
0.625 Like its predecessor, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer seems intentionally B-grade, a happy gap-filler between more prestigious comic-book films.
0.7 I had a few laughs, I enjoyed the elaborate special effects, the characters are entertaining and unpretentious, and I got out of the theater in about 90 minutes.
0.375 For non comic book fans over the age of 13, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a tedious, incoherent bore. For comic book fans of any age, it is an atrocity.
0.7 something we haven't seen in comic book movies in recent years - an honest attempt to capture the childhood essence of the fantasy
0.75 This is one of those superhero movies in which the superheroes are not nearly as charismatic as the villain. Luckily for this sequel, the Silver Surfer is on the scene.
0.3 Rise of the Silver Surfer is an existentially and aesthetically unnecessary sequel to the equally irrelevant if depressingly successful Fantastic Four.
0.8 The most flat out fun you'll have watching any superhero movie this year.
0.5 Director Tim Story does the same sort of efficient, impersonal job he did on the first movie, keeping things at such a basic, almost childish level that it seems the movie is aimed squarely, if not exclusively, at the 12-and-under set.
0.5 While it's a little bit better than the first FF movie, this one trivializes the epic sci-fi stature of the story with the same bad acting, witless "witty" dialogue and drama-leeching tone.
0.75 Clocking in at a mere yet mighty 92 minutes, this superior sequel to 2005's Fantastic Four skillfully crams loads of action, humor and even (gasp!) character development into its short but sweet flight of comic-book inspired fantasy.
0.4 As was the case with the inept 2005 original, the sequel is a shallow, shoddy, slap-dash mess of ideas and performances.
0.625 In Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, our heroes get what they deserve: a decent action flick with a jolt of visual wow.
0.625 Unlike the recent spate of blackened threequels, those bottom-of-the-bag Spideys and Shreks and Pirates and Oceans, this kernel does pop.
0.75 You don't walk out of Rise of the Silver Surfer feeling as if you've gone three rounds with the Thing. This is a case where getting less than you bargained for feels like a victory.
0.5 Better than its juvenile predecessor.
0.5 As superhero experiences go, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is mundane. It's not funny enough to be a spoof, but it's also not deep enough to hold any intrigue.
0.625 At times silly and then serious, this Fantastic Four is the cinematic equivalent of multiple personality disorder.
0.5 The Marvel comic book this movie is based on was never as sitcom-ish as the two films it's inspired.
0.8 Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is an enjoyable sequel that delivers humour, likeable characters, great special effects and plenty of comic book-style action, though fans hoping for a glimpse of Galactus should prepare for disappointment.
0.6 In the universe of dark and gloomy superheroes, this foursome are still dipping into the lighter side of fantastic.
0.2 Less than fantastic.
0.6 Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, it gets a whole lot better. Fantastic 2 may not hold a candle to Marvel's crown jewels, but by dialling down the camp it at least makes amends for its dreary predecessor.
0.4 It's all quite harmless, the shape-shifting plot does not extend much beyond 90 minutes, and Alba still looks good in a jumpsuit. We've seen it before, we'll see it again.
0.2 too dull to be fun, too inept to be engaging, and too low-rent FX-wise to be dazzling
0.875 Rise of the Silver Surfer is impressively mounted and bursting with playful, spectacular special effects.
0.4 KAPOW! The world's most boring superheroes return to lull us back to sleep in a sequel that could put the makers of Nytol out of business.
0.2 Fantasy pictures needn't be bound by the constraints of real-world logic, but they can't survive the quotidian blandness by which this one is smothered.
0.4 The makers of 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' have managed to improve their storytelling. But that's like saying that "Ghost Rider" improves when viewed in the IMAX format.
0.6 It's all very silly and the Four's life together has all the gravitas of an episode of the Monkees. Entertaining, though.
0.6 DAZZLING GLOBE-SKIPPING, LANDMARK-BASHING ACTION
0.4 Kids will probably have a blast - but pity their parents having to explain afterwards what exactly those American federal agents were doing torturing a gurneyed prisoner in a secret Siberian base.
0.5 The film hinges entirely on these gigantic, yet straightforward, simple conflicts, resulting in little or no emotional involvement in the characters.
0.25 Superficial, unimaginative and inert. The so-called heroes are pompous, one-note caricatures who have the depth of gnats, and are just as irritating.
0.5 A reading from the Books of Marvel...And the Surfer passed through buildings and buses with a squish...And Twentieth Century Fox said that it was good.
0.25 While contemporary superhero movies have evolved to dive deeper into the darker motivations, feeling and actions of the subjects, The Fantastic Four are content to be the hackneyed vaudeville act with old, stale jokes
0.625 The film spends too much time on peripheral distractions and shallow personal problems, and not enough establishing the scope, scale and sense of awe its cosmic events merit.
0.5 ...the film essentially offers up more of the same; more bad jokes, more predictable plot twists, and more ill-conceived action sequences.
0.6 Better than the first one, but that's only taking into consideration that it couldn't possibly have been any worse.
0.6 Everything about this superhero sequel surpasses the original by a long shot.
0.625 Once you accept that Fantastic Four is not trying to be anything deeper than popcorn fare, the ride can be fun -- with an ending more satisfying than Spider-Man 3.
0.5 This follow-up to the much-reviled Fantastic Four is cheerfully stupid, shallow and, frankly, more than a little tedious.
0.6 Earnest, gee-whiz and foursquare, this simple and intentionally inoffensive sequel gets points for being easy to take and scrupulously avoiding obvious sources of irritation.
0.375 Someone should tell Fantastic Four that it's live action and not a cartoon.
0.5 Although FF:ROTSS comes from the same place as Spider-Man (New York, and Marvel editor Stan Lee's noggin), this sequel to the 2005 Fantastic Four debut is lackluster, even by comparison to the lackluster Spider-Man 3.
0.25 The target audience appears to be Cartoon Network fans. Anyone outside that category is likely to find Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer a dull slog no avalanche of razzle-dazzle digital hooey can camouflage.
0.5 The movie plays out like a particularly unfunny, dysfunctional family sitcom and features even less action than its predecessor.
0.625 Unlike many recent superhero movies, Silver Surfer doesn't have a heavy, overblown quality. For the most part, it's light and playful (and short, clocking in at a brisk 90 minutes).
0.75 Rise of the Silver Surfer doesn't aspire to much. It just happens to have the three things it needs -- velocity, artistry and a pretty good story.
0.25 It's not egregiously awful like the first film. Just plain awful in that formula way that kills your spirit and all hope for summer movies.
0.375 Of all the Marvel-spawned screen franchises, the Fantastic Four is the most puerile, reducing as it does this smartly quirky comic book quartet to a fourth-grade primer in dysfunctional family psychology.
0.5 These B-list demigods are so proudly, intergalactically mediocre that both the 2005 original and the follow-up tend to disable my super-snark beam.
0.75 Much better than the original.
0.5 It is passable comic book stuff, dumb and loud. Loud. LOUD.
0.625 When will the people who adapt comic books into films realize that less can be so much more?
0.4 Beyond a few good special-effects sequences - notably the Human Torch chasing the Silver Surfer between skyscrapers, the movie is uniformly vanilla. When the heroes aren't polishing their super-skills, they sit around and complain about their lot in life.
0.5 This humdrum collection of comic book characters ... makes you long for the thrilling adventures of someone called, say, The Accountant.
0.6 Bigger, better and more polished than the first, with a quite satisfactory ratio of action set-pieces and a lot of juvenile japery squarely aimed at its PG and fanboy audience.
0.6 At last! A comic-book block-buster that doesn't feel the need to justify its own existence with ponderous philosophical subtext and bloated running times.
0.6 It takes a while to get going, but once it does, it clips along, entertains, and doesn't overstay its welcome.
0.9 One of a handful of legitimately bold, original summer tentpoles of the 2000s.
0.8 Rip-roaring fun for kids who don't mind skeletons.
1.0 one of the all time greatest adventure flicks
0.625 Oops, there I go again talking about Johnny Depp. Get used to that. He's all you'll remember from the movie.
0.8 Pirates of the Caribbean is exactly what you look for in a summer blockbuster, all while delivering a much-needed overhaul to the classic pirate flicks of the golden years.
0.75 Depp's highly strange, oddly magnetic, and irresistibly entertaining performance energizes the overextended, two-hour-plus proceedings.
0.4 If you think the title is long, wait until you see the movie.
0.8 Tthe real surprise here is how strong the writing holds up.
0.8 Comes close to recreating some of the bigger-than-life wonder that we experience at the movies in our childhood. Depp is a fey, hilarious wonder.
0.75 May cause you to sing "Yo, ho-ho and a bottle of rum" and shout phrases such as "Tie the scurvy dogs to the yardarm" just for the fun of it.
0.9 It's a rare thing when I come out of a movie theater these days saying the words, 'Geez, I hope they do a sequel to this thing.'
0.875 Depp is wonderful here, and Sparrrow is the best creation of the movie year.
0.9 ...Full of colorful visuals, amazing special effects, and plenty of silly fun for the whole family.
0.9 Both kids and adults will thoroughly enjoy this movie. It's a lot of fun and well worth checking out. I highly recommend checking it out on the big screen.
0.8 Johnny Depp takes a big chance in an over the top performance that could just as easily have turned into a bad joke as a larger than life character.
0.9 More fun than a tankard of grog and a flashpacket sittin' on yer lap.
0.8 Villains, heroes, scalawags, and ghosts, skeletons, daring rescues, audacious escapes, and treasure aplenty.
0.875 Pirates of the Caribbean is an entertaining, swashbuckling adventure that will leave audiences wanting a sequel.
1.0 I was transported back to my childhood watching this movie. I honestly felt like a kid again.
0.75 'Es la mas grata sorpresa de un verano filmico lleno de secuelas bastante mediocres'
1.0 Johnny, the kids and the pirates have a number-one hit on their hands. They raise the Jolly Roger and make other summer blockbusters walk the plank.
0.8 . A giddily goofy bit of old-fashioned nonsense that literally puts the curse back on the pirates themselves. You'll have a barrel of fun. .
0.75 ...a jolly roger rollercoaster of fun.
0.8 Depp merece ser indicado ao Oscar por sua performance - afinal, interpretar um matematico esquizofrenico ou um policial corrupto dificilmente envolve tantos riscos quanto o de viver um pirata como Jack Sparrow.
1.0 ... a superior concept that incorporated all the key elements that made the attraction successful... a new franchise for Disney for sequels that won't have to be direct-to-video.
0.8 Flynn and Fairbanks would be very, very proud.
0.6 Yo ho ho-hum, the ride was better, and shorter. The two main stars of the film are some fantastic visuals and Johnny Depp's performance (which is the saving grace many times over).
0.8 And shiver me timbers, it works. Not just Depp's crazy voice and Keith Richard-inspired ponce-foonery, but the whole shenanigan.
0.75 Although too good to toss aside, Pirates is as formulaic a movie as you're likely to see this year.
0.5 Buries its treasures -- mainly Johnny Depp in eye shadow and dreads as Captain Jack Sparrow -- in briny cliches.
0.875 the best corporate-produced blockbuster to emerge this summer
0.5 Not a sunken wreck by any means. At the same time, not quite summer movie treasure.
0.75 It's never a good sign when source material is based off of something as flimsy as a theme park thrill ride, but Pirates of the Caribbean works on many cylinders.
0.9 Johnny Depp rules the roost, and the mainsails, the masts, the bilge, the seas and all challenges on land. ...rascally good fun and an entertainment level Disney can bank on.
1.0 Wonderful swashbuckling adventure that delivers everything you could possibly want from a pirate movie, plus a little more besides -- jaw-dropping special effects, a superb script and a show-stealing performance from Johnny Depp.
0.7 Johnny Depp plays Jack Sparrow as if Errol Flynn were pretending to be Keith Richards.
0.875 Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean is a rousing action/adventure yarn highlighted by a truly eccentric performance by Johnny Depp.
0.7 The result is something that, to use an analogy here, is like the more outgoing but less thoughtful younger brother of 1998's swashbuckler The Mask of Zorro.
0.75 With prissy swagger and loveable bravado, Depp's a pirate captain who steals your heart.
0.8 Isn't it about time us adults had our own big, explosively dumb, blustery adventure? If I ain't hearing "Aye, matey, I'm on-board," than stay home and re-watch your arty Citizen Kane, ya boring spoilsport!
0.8 This is a superb swashbuckler -- rousing, funny and spectacular.
0.8 Who says they don't make full-on swashbucklers anymore?
0.8 An exciting time at the movies.
0.8 Pirates of the Caribbean is a return to the high seas a la the great adventures of Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks.
0.7 Had Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl no other attributes, the sheer spectacle of Depp would be worth the cost of admission, but shockingly, his cheeky performance is just one bit of a booty bursting with goodies.
0.5 If you've often seen this type of summer fare, you might find this movie tedious
0.8 Pirate adventure is a ridiculously entertaining romp thanks to Johnny Depp's scene-stealing scallywag and Gore Verbinski's directorial hand.
1.0 Pirates packs great sword fights, incredible stunts, piratical doings, a curse, romance, a parrot and a cunningly evil monkey. I can't think of any reason not to see this movie.
0.875 It feels like a cross between Errol Flynn and Monty Python.
0.84 Johnny Depp puts the "swish" back into swishbuckler
0.7 Gore Verbinski's ship is full of great fun and terrific images even if Jerry tries to make it into a Pearl Harbor mess with a way-over lenght and goofy side characters.
0.6 [Depp has] the air of someone who's decided reality is just a bit too much of a chore, he verges on camp and sometimes blithely surrenders to it altogether.
0.625 It's not so much the minor flaws as it is the fact that Pirates of the Caribbean just wasn't enough fun for me.
0.75 AAaarrrghh-uably one of the summer's best!
0.75 Fun -- pure and simple.
0.8 It's something we've been lacking at the cinema for a while now: pure fun.
0.6 Gore Verbinski's direction seems to sway whichever possible way will get the most reaction at any given moment. It's a movie of whim,...[a] hit-or-miss dartboard variety of whatever goes, goes.
0.75 The only special effect Pirates of the Caribbean needed was the eyeliner beneath the unsteady eyes of Johnny Depp.
0.625 While certainly not a bad film, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl nonetheless rates as somewhat of a disappointment, given the talent involved.
0.6 Depp casts a spell every bit as powerful as any demonic bullion.
0.6 Certainly, Pirates has its moments. But it's definitely no 'E' ticket.
0.625 'The Haunted Mansion' with Eddie Murphy is scheduled for Thanksgiving. No word yet about possible movies based on the Enchanted Tiki Room or the spinnning teacups...
0.75 I enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean enough to recommend it but there are a couple of serious flaws with it that should be addressed.
0.75 We find a few unexpected treasures mildewing away in Jerry Bruckheimer's chest of slimy old cliches: a script that occasionally borders on cleverness, a winningly sleazy performance by Johnny Depp and a considerable sense of style from Gore Verbinski.
0.8 has the feel of a great Saturday matinee: It's almost all 'good parts,' with very few opportunities for expeditions to the concession stand.
0.5 Spooky, atmospheric direction and a colorful turn by Depp clash with the dumbed-down storyline and veritable booty of pirate cliches.
0.4 An overly long adventure that, with some tinkering and editing, could have been more akin to such classics as The Crimson Pirate rather than just a reminder that they exist.
0.875 Not only wildly surpasses its poor expectations, but also stands tall as one of the very best summer movies of all time.
0.5 The movie is marvelously filmed with visual touches recalling fantasy specialists Terry Gilliam and Ray Harryhausen, among others.
0.875 Pirates of the Caribbean is surprisingly good but it probably would not have been half as entertaining if it were not for Johnny Depp's commanding performance as Captain Jack Sparrow.
0.75 Depp...is `Pirates'' loose cannon, and the real reason to see the film.
0.6 Ultimately makes for an enjoyable evening back in the time of pirates, treasures, wenches and Natalie Portman lookalikes in distress.
0.875 Brisk, exciting and, at times, wildly funny, Pirates wisely channels blockbusters of old that didn't have the benefit of more-more-more effects or angst-filled, Daddy-didn't-love-me plotlines.
0.5 It's not that 'Pirates of the endless title: and subtitle' is a bad movie, it's just unremarkable.
0.5 By the end, the film has gone from being a cheesy delight to an aimless, tired smorgasbord of empty action scenes.
1.0 A joy to watch - an adventure, funny, sexy boys, fantastic effects, great story. What do you want, an engraved invitation?
0.625 Pirates is Indiana Jones on the high seas, complete with serial B-movie concept, wall-to-wall action, and fantastic myths come true.
0.875 Pirates will enthrall kids and amuse adults. Its only failing is that at 2 hours and 15 minutes, it's about 20 minutes too long.
0.5 A cleverly nostalgic, high-tech copy of the real deal.
0.4 There is much by way of noise, computer-generated action, big sets and breezy laughs, and practically nothing to intrude on your thought processes afterwards.
0.75 At nearly 2 1/2 hours, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is as ridiculously overlong as its title, but it is also scary fun.
0.75 A fun Disney ride.
0.75 Who knew Johnny Depp was a theme park all by himself?
0.5 Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that you ride around in circles for 2 hours and 23 minutes, until at last it brings you back where you began, exhausted and a lot dizzier.
0.5 A monotonous, repetitive spectacle of endless shipboard sword fights and pirate ghosts in the moonlight.
0.75 Just imagine spending two hours-plus on a Pirates of the Caribbean ride and you'll get some idea of the approximate sensations that this movie creates.
0.4 Given the movie's dark, dense and overly long nature, I'm not sure it was inspired enough.
0.75 An improbably entertaining, if overlong, adventure that brings new meaning to the term 'summer camp.'
0.8 Rarely serious yet not expressly a comedy, Pirates successfully replicates the hammy cinematics of a Disney theme-park ride.
0.8 A theme park ride has been successfully transferred to the screen.
0.5 Pirates of the Caribbean tends to overstay its welcome.
0.75 While the plot and action are all deliberately familiar, director Gore Verbinski steers a continual course for sheer, mindless, rope-swinging, crow's-nest-hollering summer fun.
0.75 A pretty fun ride all by itself.
0.75 The summer's oddest, most unexpected blockbuster has arrived.
0.75 Depp hijacks -- no, commandeers -- the staginess and special effects, turning Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl into a giddy adventure.
1.0 From stem to stern this rousing adventure shines ship-shape and Bristol fashion.
1.0 Long title. Waaay too long a movie. Other than that, it's flawless entertainment.
0.8 An affectionate, tongue-in-cheek homage to the famous ride and it's just as irreverent and wild as the ride ever was.
0.75 An entertaining flick, but not for the full 2 hours and 20 minutes...seems a bit long.
0.75 This is one of the few summer movies this year that actually feels like a summer movie.
0.75 A movie that charms the audience and then outstays its welcome.
0.75 An exhilaratingly funny movie ride.
0.7 Boasts the season's best production values, first-rate computer-animated special effects and a strong ensemble cast ready to toss your low expectations overboard.
0.75 May not blow you out of the water as the trailer promised, but it delivers enough fun to shiver anyone's timbers.
0.75 ... Pirates is a fantasy excursion that will bring out the Peter Pan in you.
0.25 Yo ho, yo ho! A full refund for me!
0.7 You may need a shot of rum to get through the first 30 minutes, but after that it's rather entertaining.
0.4 Frankly, I thought the film was boring.
0.6 The movie is better than it deserves to be, given its origins: a ride at Disneyland and Disney World.
0.75 A fast-moving, wickedly funny and vividly mounted distraction that brings to mind adventure romps like The Mummy, The Princess Bride and Disney's The Mask of Zorro, with Antonio Banderas.
0.4 As forgettable as a bad day in the Disneyland parking lot.
0.75 Bruckheimer and pals have cobbled together all of the pirate genre's tropes -- the cannonballs, the sword fights, the glittering treasure -- and freshened them up, throwing in a couple of nods to the Disneyland ride for good measure.
0.75 The most entertaining amusement of a summer divided between spectacles that force you to exercise your brain and spectacles that seem to suck the brain right out of your head.
0.75 Pirates of the Caribbean may have taken its nutso inspiration from a theme-park ride. But it has become, without a doubt, its own wild ride.
0.8 [Tackled] in a way that shows they were interested in putting together a solid piece of entertainment, not just a string of action sequences connected by a bad plot.
0.6 Depp easily steals the show, delivering a quirky performance that has him teetering around like a flamboyant dandy with cerebral palsy...
1.0 Never before have I been so thrilled about being so wrong: despite all my early skepticism, Pirates ends up one of the most entertaining movies of the past few years.
0.875 Peg-legs, parrots, hidden treasure, plank-walking, and plunging necklines... Now, that's what a pirate movie is about!
0.875 This is a helluva enjoyable flick that (dare I say it) doesn't require the knowledge of a trip down that old boat ride since it creates its own ride all by itself.
0.75 This movie is a lot more entertaining than the Disney ride itself, and will perhaps stand the test of time -- and repeat viewings -- even more.
0.875 One foot of the film is in Terry Gilliam's ethics of the stratum surreal, with the other in Spielbergian theme park attraction.
0.75 Pirates of the Caribbean has a smart script, an attractive cast, some very creative violence and romance to boot.
0.75 Swashbuckling adventures are few and far between these days, so it's a pleasant surprise to see one that is competently made.
0.8 This rollicking adventure is everything a pirate movie should be -- witty dialogue, double-crosses, swordfights, skeletons and gold coins aplenty.
0.875 I'm now here to eat every bad word I said in anticipation of this movie...it may well be one of the most enjoyable pirate escapades of all time.
0.625 Pirates of the Caribbean is fun -- but only as long as you don't expect much.
0.8 A pirate movie made with a pirate's sensibility for filmmaking.
0.625 Before it becomes redundant, the action is truly fun and classically swashbuckling.
0.5 Would have been a complete nightmare if it weren't for Depp, whose character is an unholy melange of Captain Morgan, Dudley Moore, Keith Richards and Andy Dick.
1.0 POTC: Legend of the Black Pearl is an immediate Disney(TM) Classic. It's a frolicking ten ton treasure chest of swashbuckling summer fun! Watch:Red Carpet Coverage
0.75 Akroyd and Basinger give the film an infectious stroke of energy, and by the end we continue to smile even as we are exhausted under the weight of endless nonsense.
0.4 Pretty dumb fantasy-sci-fi-comedy directed by Richard Benjamin.
0.6 Not nearly as bad as advertised.
0.6 Harmless.
0.4 There were more laughs in "Nine and a Half Weeks"
0.3 ...and your movie is a joke.
1.0 Inventive, prophetic black comedy; lots of violence, mayhem.
1.0 Brazil is this unique amalgamation of ideas straight out of Terry Gilliam's head that results in something so strange and so unique that it's just genius with a conclusion that is undeniably haunting.
0.9 An energetically quirky social metaphor, political commentary and action/sci-fi farce all balled up into one outrageously enjoyable experience, provided you like the work of Terry Gilliam.
1.0 Gilliam crams the screen with such a proliferation of bizarre and comic details that you'll want to revisit this particular nightmare again and again.
0.75 Brazil is a stinging, Strangelovian satire of the power of the bureaucracy in an Orwellian landscape.
1.0 Brazil serves up one of the most breathtakingly imaginative worlds ever to be put on screen.
0.875 Brazil -- a black comedy that remains ahead of its time -- is one of the most audacious fantasies ever made.
0.85 Gilliam's Orwellian vision is memorable and distinctive
1.0 Brilliant all around; Gilliam at his peak
0.8 Celebrates imagination as the only escape from a bleak, ridiculous, and troubled world.
1.0 It has visual style and imagination to burn, but it's the ideas behind it that make it a modern classic..
1.0 An intelligent, thought provoking, visually stunning film.
1.0 Dense, complex, nightmarish, thought-provoking and ultimately shattering.
1.0 An imaginitive and haunting post-Orwellian reimagining of 1984.
0.8 A superb example of the power of comedy to underscore serious ideas, even solemn ones.
1.0 The most original movie of the past thirty years; a triumph not only of brilliant filmmaking, but of the director's desire to stay true to his vision.
0.9 This film is considered Terry Gilliam's masterwork. I am inclined to agree.
1.0 One of the greatest films of the century.
0.5 Very hard to follow.
0.79 Brazil succeeds in painting an entertaining and chaotic picture of a nasty world where none of us would want to live.
1.0 Not in everybody's taste, but why risk missing one of the most brilliant science fiction movies ever made?
0.625 Although the good outweighs the bad, the film is, nevertheless, one big muddle.
1.0 Contains some of the most clever lines ever.
0.2 "Who do I have to screw to get out of this movie?" Anna Nicole yells at one key point, and we know exactly how she feels.
0.2 It offers a central conceit that makes no sense and a mystery that makes even less.
1.0 Nothing about this strange, moving work of agit-pop has ever seemed out of date. If anything, "Alphaville" moves closer to relevance with every passing year.
1.0 A bracing salute to American gangster pics, with a jumpy European post-war uncertainty thrown in.
1.0 Although this is drastically different compared to the rest of Godard's oeuvre, it has without a doubt had a lasting impact with its ground-breaking visuals.
0.8 Karina proves to be the beating heart of the movie, getting its piercing last line (no spoilers here). Yet it's Constantine's ravaged mug that you remember.
0.8 It may mean absolutely nothing, but it's undeniably one interesting ride -- across universes in a Ford Galaxy.
0.87 The haunting imagery and dystopian vision of Alphaville deserves comparison to Fritz Lang's Metropolis
0.4 New Wave classic. Set bold new standards. Whatever.
1.0 This cold war allegorical sci-fi film is imaginatively made and proves that sometimes the most mundane images can become dazzling in the right context.
0.8 Packed to the brim with imagination, particularly the insane 2nd half.
1.0 It works both as a philosophical treatise on politics and film as well as an entertaining and often amusing look at a future overrun by technology.
0.9 A poetic, funny, and visually inspired blend of sci-fi, detective-film satire, and political allegory.
1.0 Esta fascinante mistura de noir, 1984 e Admiravel Mundo Novo filosofa, como Solaris faria sete anos depois, sobre a natureza do homem e suas contradicoes.
1.0 Godard's masterpiece of French new-wave cinema. Essential viewing.
0.6 These ideas are more prevalent than ever, which tends to horribly date Alphaville against its more thought-out successors like A Clockwork Orange and Blade Runner.
0.6 Lighthearted superhero action is fun -- but big toy ad.
0.75 Beautifully animated and utterly charming.
0.625 A typically slick effort from DreamWorks Animation...
0.8 As a child who loathed the wholesomeness of Disney and wholeheartedly embraced the madcap antics of Bugs Bunny, Wile E. Coyote and Daffy Duck this film was perfect for me.
0.6 The film has some serious problems, the first being - and yes, I feel ridiculous for even attributing this complaint to a film with the above title - a completely pat narrative that seriously lacks character development
0.4 Me quede con hambre de mas y es que siento que Dreamworks, fuera del verde Shrek, no ha encontrado la formula para darle verdadera batalla a Disney Pixar.
0.75 Inked more by its influences than originality, "Monsters" gets exhaustive with its rapid-fire references. That said, if this works as a shiny primer to one day introduce children to classic sci-fi, satire, fantasy and anime, well, more power to it.
0.75 Not as wonderful as Kung Fu Panda, Monsters vs. Aliens is the next best thing that DreamWorks Animation has produced.
0.5 ...for kids Monsters vs. Aliens has a lot of color and action, and it's not too scary. Fair enough. As long as you're a kid.
0.625 A happy, family-friendly movie without a mean bone in its mutated body, even though it features a giant killer robot machine and its four-eyed alien squid master, a megalomaniac who's out to kill and/or enslave all of humanity.
0.625 The real reason to see this movie is the stunning 3-D craftsmanship.
0.6 This movie was comfortably middle of the road. While Dreamworks has frankly annoyed me to the point of almost-boycott, they can't forever turn out such drivel, right? Monsters Vs Aliens is not poo at all, it's not bad. It's not going to set the world o
0.75 It continues to be a banner year for animation, with "Monsters vs. Aliens" proving to be a fast-paced and witty family adventure that simultaneously pays homage to and pokes fun at all those cheesy science fiction films from the 1950s.
0.625 A film that relies more on gimmicks than on plotting.
0.5 moiazei me mikser poy o kathenas petakse mesa tin idea toy me ligo seloteip gia na kollisei
0.6 It's too bad the new 3D glasses can't fix sloppy writing.
0.625 Monsters vs. Aliens still packs a sufficient amount of jolting jocularity that is sure to satisfy the entertaining mindsets of youngsters and oldsters alike...a zesty escapist treat
0.7 Not only spectacularly well made but frequently very funny.
0.7 If you are looking for a diversionary flick you can take the kids to and everybody comes out having had a good time, this is perfect.
0.6 The latest cartoon from DreamWorks isn't a classic, but it makes the grade for Easter viewing.
0.6 Monsters vs. Aliens is both a spoof and celebration of mid-century creature features, offering positive, if well-worn, "messages for the kids."
0.8 The voice casting is superb, with Hugh Laurie and Seth Rogen the standouts along with Witherspoon. There's also plenty of amazing action. The epic battle over the Golden Gate bridge is as exciting as any top live-action movie.
0.5 Given that the film was sold as the biggest kind of spectacle, it's disappointing though not surprising that it's so barbarically typical.
0.875 Susan is a character with real, um, weight...
0.75 This bright and lively computer-animated 3D comedy-adventure gives the masters of animation at Pixar a run for their box office riches.
0.625 This is a movie that will more than delight the younger tykes.
0.875 ...the first really memorable film of 2009, and clearly the most fun.
0.5 Monsters vs Aliens is skilfully animated and spasmodically funny, but you get the impression the film's seven (!) writers ran out of ideas two-thirds of the way through.
0.7 A comprehensively entertaining package. If there's a lack of originality, the film is bolstered by the sheer verve of the animation and effects.
0.6 Engagingly nerdy movie in-jokes are clearly a step in the right direction for DreamWorks after the rather crass and bombastic approach of the Shrek movies.
0.6 It's all very good value, although I have a vague feeling that a gallery of freaky sci-fi creatures, as in Monsters Inc, may not engage the young audience's sympathies as much as humanoids. Great fun, anyway.
0.4 The movie never grows a heart, which doesn't stop it trying to tattoo one onto its chest. By the whizz-bang climax inside the alien mothership, I was fidgeting like a four-year-old at Cosi fan tutte.
0.4 Heart and soul are sacrificed for sequences of loud characters pinballing across the screen in search of an easy laugh. The whole endeavour is an unsubtle, in your face CG-animated assault from DreamWorks.
0.6 Despite being second out of the 3D traps after Bolt, their first special-specs-required outing is at least as eye-catching as Pixar's Oscar-nominated pacesetter. Occasionally, it's even better.
0.6 DreamWorks Animation tries something new, but we prefer its talking-animal comedies Madagascar and Kung Fu Panda.
0.8 A snappy script and some neat 3D make for an above-average romp with plenty of in-jokes for cineastes and fan-boys alike.
0.6 DreamWorks still has a lot to learn about the superior powers of immersion exerted by a well-told story.
0.8 This is probably THE family film of the year so far and it's one that has enough grown up (and by that I don't mean rude) gags to ensure that adults enjoy this too. The script is razor sharp and the voice cast is spot one.
0.7 The kids may not get all the references, but theya(TM)ll enjoy the spectacular action and broad comedy, especially if they manage to see it in 3D.
0.6 They're outweighed by moments of real, albeit surreal, charm - like when gelatinous BOB chats up a dish of pineapple jelly at a pool party - that would melt the heart of even a sentient blob of gloop.
0.8 The voice cast has been well chosen, with everyone delivering their lines with just the right mix of satire and seriousness. It all makes for a horrifyingly humorous hour-and-a-half.
0.8 Besides a big heart, it has outstanding 3-D action sequences
0.4 This Easter digimation romp is big on action and slapstick, small on charm, tiny on wit and endurability; unless you are nine, when anything goes.
0.8 Aficianadoes of 1950s monster movies should have a ball spotting all the references. All anyone else requires is a taste for good fun.
0.6 This lively story about a young girl who gets hit by a meteor on her wedding day that turns her into a giant is certainly wacky enough.
0.8 The film lacks the soft, friendly edge of something like Monsters, Inc and sags a little after the first big fight, but it's gigantic fun nevertheless.
0.8 Enjoyable, frequently funny comedy with strong, likeable characters, impressive animation and a script that's packed with both terrific gags and subtle movie references for film fans.
0.8 With a sharply funny script, vivid characters and eye-popping imagery, this is a raucously enjoyable animated film
0.8 Kids will adore the flash 3D visuals, brilliant action sequences and ace sight gags. Mums, dads and others will relish the quickfire dialogue-some of the best we've heard for a while in any film-and the affectionate nods to sci-fi of times past.
0.8 The animation is spectacular and the action full on. The monsters are cute and lovable even though they're still pretty ugly.
0.8 Monsters vs Aliens is still unlikely to blow your mind, but it will make you bust a gut laughing, and that's certainly something worth celebrating in animation.
0.75 Spielberg references, action, humor, romance and 3D. What more do you want from a family-friendly flick?
0.8 I think many young children will learn from this film without even realizing they're being taught something.
0.7 MONSTERS VS ALIENS comes so close to being something truly special, but even as a movie that's just enjoyably above average it beats the pants off everything else that Dreamworks has done so far.
0.625 a brightly colored mash-up of pop-culture gags that speeds at you so fast and furiously that it feels like a rush even if you can't remember much about it the next day
0.4 A terrific idea with the heart sucked out.
0.8 3-D debris (both animal and mineral) fly out of the screen every minute or so. Best wear an apron if you're suggestible.
0.7 There's nothing really wrong with it, but there is a lot that isn't quite right.
0.625 In what other movie do you get shout-outs to "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "Beverly Hills Cop" in the same frame. "Monsters vs. Aliens" might be a better time capsule of kitsch than an actual movie.
0.375 On the bright side, it's short.
0.4 The 3-D effects look great, no doubt, but the film ultimately falls victim to a contrived, unoriginal plot that just shows once again how far behind Disney/Pixar, DreamWorks Animation is.
0.625 In the case of Monsters v. Aliens--henceforth to be referred to as 'Monsters Vs. Aliens'--we find in favor of monsters.
0.7 The 3-D enhances the movie rather than detracting from it and that is not always the case.
0.5 The jokes are good; the animation is fine; the 3-D is awesome. But still the film fails to make a monster or an alien as powerful a character as the little clownfish Marlin from FINDING NEMO.
0.75 I was hoping Monsters Vs. Aliens would turn out to be a documentary about the Trial Lawyers Association against the Taliban. Maybe both sides would get wiped out?
0.5 With a title like Monsters Vs. Aliens, [it] tells you exactly what it's going to be. Yet so did Snakes on a Plane, and somehow that movie managed to disappoint as well.
0.6 In short, if you're going to see Monsters vs. Aliens, the only way to do it is in 3D. Looking back, I think I'd be miserable just watching a 2D screening of this movie.
0.625 Pleasant but often pedestrian.
0.625 Attack of the 50 Foot Shrug.
0.6 Monsters Vs. Aliens is a fine rainy-Sunday diversion, but if you want real monster and alien fun, hit up Netflix and rent some of the classics that inspired it.
0.6 A loud, rushed, choppy, silly, colorful Nintendo game of a movie. And it could have been DreamWorks' version of "The Incredibles."
0.875 A wholesome family flick that everybody can enjoy, provided mom and dad are willing to turn off their brains when they put on the 3-D glasses.
0.75 Monsters vs. Aliens is genetically engineered to appeal to young and old alike. That's not how you make an animated classic, though.
0.75 There is something magical about watching a well-made 3-D feature film--even one with a less than stellar script--to listen to the ooh's and ahs and giggles generated by kids in a sold-out theater.
0.875 The ongoing advances in animation make it easier for filmmakers to create worlds we can get lost in, which is exactly what happens here.
0.75 As the first out of the gate, this family-friendly movie is a legitimate contender for best animated feature film.
1.0 Original. Clever. Brilliant. Insert your own adjective here. Monsters Vs. Aliens is flat out the funniest flick of the year.
0.75 You'll probably take your kids to see Monsters vs. Aliens, but you might have more fun seeing the movie without them.
0.6 Plenty of giggles and thrills to keep the kiddies happy while a clever script filled with nods to the alien invasion movies of the 1950s will keep their parents in stitches.
0.5 It's about a tenth as entertaining as, say, Monsters, Inc. -- one of the lesser Pixar movies -- and it doesn't reach the same heights as DreamWorks' previous monster franchise, Shrek.
0.8 Now, I know I can't predict the future, nor do I have a Magic 8 Ball at my disposal, but I just don't see how Up will be able to outperform the sensational Monsters vs. Aliens, which is one monster mash that truly is a graveyard smash.
0.75 I am strong, I am invincible, I am woman takes on a whole new meaning at 50 feet tall.
0.7 This is an example of a mainstream studio blockbuster done right%u2014it effectively balances humor and action, as well as small character beats with big set-pieces.
0.25 With all the terrific animated movies we've seen in the past few years, this sort of tossed-off dreck is simply not acceptable.
0.625 I don't think there are any characters here that a child would love.
0.8 Homage to '50s alien flicks too intense for youngest kids.
0.625 See it for the dozens of homages to old movie monsters and movie genres.
0.6 All in all, Monsters Vs. Aliens has enough colour, motion and mayhem to keep the kids entertained for the required 90 minutes
0.25 Heavily touted as an industry breakthrough for 3-D, DreamWorks Animation's clunky and wildly unimaginative Monsters vs. Aliens really doesn't have a clue what to do with the technique.
0.75 The 3-D animation, occasional gross-out jokes and way-cool beasties and robots play to every 10-year-old, chronological or just in spirit.
0.8 In terms of generating pure, Monstrous laughs this is the year's funniest comedy so far - animated OR live action.
0.5 Shooting a chaotic action scene in an extra dimension definitely adds to the clutter, but does zilch to subtract from the tedium.
0.75 Overall, Monsters vs. Aliens is pleasing without being especially hilarious. Some lines fall flat, and a few bits involving B.O.B. are overused. But a lack of zingers is forgivable in a movie of such visual accomplishment.
0.5 The cool stuff -- like 3-D and collapsing bridges -- may get filmmakers halfway there, but to make it all the way home, they need the usual movie elements, like a good story and vivid characters, and here Monsters vs. Aliens comes up short.
0.75 As willfully chock-full of the familiar as the animated feature is, it's also a hoot.
0.75 This film has hidden depths, especially for adults who mistakenly think Monsters vs. Aliens is only for kids.
0.625 The dirty little secret is that 3-D is frequently painful. [But] it's a sweet little movie, which is easy to enjoy once your eyes adjust.
0.375 The directors, Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon, who also wrote the shabby gag-book script with four other conspirators, simply throw everything at the wall and see if it will stick.
0.55 Directors Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon push so hard for three-dimensionality that they basically have their animators putting sightlines before storylines.
0.6 DreamWorks proves it can be a force in the animation genre with its highly entertaining effort here.
0.4 Monsters Vs. Aliens is visually pleasing but a sad attempt at entertaining kids. The film is riddled with tired jokes and wasted talent. Wait for the cable viewing.
0.585 Despite spectacular visuals and sporadic thrills, Monsters vs. Aliens lacks the consistent fun, inventiveness, wit and big-heartedness found in superior, unforgettable CGI action-adventures such as The Incredibles.
0.75 The new 3D animated feature film from Dreamworks is really less of a kids' movie and more of a witty science fiction comedy aimed at fans of cheesy 1950s sci-fi films.
0.5 For a 3-D movie, Monsters vs. Aliens is appallingly one-dimensional.
0.6 What begins as a promising homage to classic sci-fi silliness turns into the unwanted answer to the unasked question "What would a Joe Dante film be like without Joe Dante directing it?"
0.5 Funny, but stumbles from scene to scene kind of like Lindsay Lohan stumbles out of the Roosevelt Hotel on a Friday night.
0.6 Seth Rogen as an animated blob is awesome, just like this action packed animation.
0.75 Three-dimensional sequences, whether animated or live action, can feel more gimmicky than integral to the tale. Happily, such is not the case with the entertaining Monsters vs. Aliens.
0.7 "Nice" is the adjective that seems to surface most in trying to pin down the film's most salient quality, which means that while the film is enjoyable enough, it is unlikely to become a classic for us, or a Shrek sort of franchise for DreamWorks.
0.6 A highly competent, smartly engineered delivery system for the very cliches it pretends to subvert.
0.875 The voice performers are clearly having fun. Witherspoon hasn't sounded this free and easy in years, and Stephen Colbert steals scenes as the voice of the U.S. president.
0.75 Another fast and funny digitally animated DreamWorks kid flick.
0.625 An animated funhouse that delivers on its title and ups its scary-comic impact if you see it in 3-D.
0.375 Pilfering everything from Mothra to Attack of the 50 Foot Woman to Men in Black and Monsters, Inc. the script piles on the mayhem and forgets the funny.
0.75 As 'Monsters vs. Aliens' demonstrates, 3-D technology is finally coming into its own, used to create a dazzlingly lifelike spectacle that seems to jump off the screen and into the theater beside you.
0.75 Do see this movie in 3-D if you can, and don't hesitate to send the kids; there's just enough silly humor to keep them happy.
0.5 a clear example of sensational style over underbaked substance
0.5 While it has a crisp 3-D look and nice vocal performances, this action-comedy will seem fresh only to 8-year-olds -- though it may give parents an excuse to introduce some of the '50s horror movies it parodies.
0.625 A wispy-thin but suitably quick-witted homage to the science-fiction genre, Monsters vs. Aliens is not up to par with the best of Pixar and Disney, but it is a step in the right direction.
0.625 The latest computer-animated production from DreamWorks is a perfectly acceptable family movie.
0.75 An amalgam of the vintage sci-fier Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman and Pixar's Monsters Inc., Monsters vs. Aliens is a goofy computer-animated romp that works just fine in the traditional moviegoing format.
0.6 A pleasant experience that's never annoying but also rarely more than mildly thrilling.
0.75 Visual gimmicks and puns change from decade to decade, but worthwhile ideals go on forever.
0.4 The result traffics in rote truisms (love the skin you're in; leave no man behind; etc.) that are admirable but perfunctory.
0.8 Visually awesome and eye-popping, particularly if you catch it in IMAX 3_D.
0.625 Monsters vs. Aliens is possibly the most commercial title of the year. How can you resist such a premise, especially if it's in 3-D animation? Very readily, in my case.
0.75 Monsters vs. Aliens may lack a bit of heart, but it more than compensates with intelligent humor.
0.6 Monsters vs. Aliens has amazing 3D, solid gags, wacky concepts and great animation; I just wish that at some point along the way someone had been as passionate about the story as they were about the spectacle.
0.75 The movie ably disguises its conventional kids' fare premise in a clever satiric shell.
0.5 A surprisingly dull affair.
0.6 A 3D animated family film that allows us to cheer for a female superhero and her companions.
0.5 A lightweight saga about not being a doormat to egomaniacal men and embracing your, um, inner superpowered 50-foot-tall monster?
0.5 If the difference between a movie and an ad is substantial character, excitement and story, then Monsters vs. Aliens is officially a toy commercial.
0.8 The script -- an affectionate spoof of 1950s sci-fi -- is funny, exciting (especially in IMAX 3-D) and has a nice visual texture.
0.8 Funny, insouciant and loaded with charm, Monsters vs. Aliens is the kind of blockbuster spectacle you wish came along every summer.
0.75 ...has a shlocky, sci-fi title that's straight from the 1950s, and the more affection you have for that period, the more you'll appreciate the movie.
0.875 There's something about Susan.
0.8 The humor is dry, the sentiment unapologetic, and the absurdity sublime
0.6 Though the movie's action beats are underdeveloped, they've successfully poured all of their creativity into making us laugh.
0.875 I liked it more than anything Pixar has made the last five years.
0.625 Sure, the film is sweet and harmless but, take away the 3D, and all you're left with is a generic kids' movie.
0.8 Don't overthink Monsters vs. Aliens. Just enjoy it.
0.8 The action scenes are downright thrilling, the storytelling is brisk and witty, the homages to alien and monster movies funny and affectionate.
0.7 Cute and clever and often entertaining, but never quite lives up to the potential of the premise nor is it as funny as you might hope based on the talent involved.
1.0 While the jokes take a back seat to the action in the film's big climax, there are earlier moments that rank among the most fighting-for-breath funny stuff I've seen at the movies in ages.
0.8 An intelligent consideration of a thorny subject, fueled by three great central performances.
0.75 The movie is seriously smile-worthy, largely due to the sheer number of jokes throughout.
0.8 Gunn doesn't so much reinvent the wheel as reshape it a little, giving the rest of the vehicle a fresh lick of paint in the process.
0.9 I had more fun watching Guardians of the Galaxy than I've had in a long time.
0.6 In proper "who gives a toss?" B-movie tradition, Guardians of the Galaxy takes us into the silly section of the Marvel Universe.
0.875 The screenplay does an exceptional job of incorporating this film into the pre-existing and percolating Marvel cinematic universe.
0.8 With its fantastic ensemble of characters and great sense of humor (not to mention an incredible soundtrack), it rises above the standard formula to make an entertaining and thrilling ride that leaves a lasting impression.
0.75 Gunn has done a marvelous job of character development with a large cast of unknown comic-book roles.
0.4 Guardians of the Galaxy exists solely to advertise its own as-yet-unmade sequels.
1.0 Larger-than-life and dangerously explosive, they're so funny that boys and girls will love the film in equal measure.
0.8 Once again, we get an against-the-odds, mid-air battle among exploding skyscrapers and fleeing extras. But it's beautifully realised in eye-popping 3D.
0.8 There are obvious touchstones here in Star Wars and Indiana Jones, but Gunn allows his influences to inform rather than define the film.
0.8 Guardians Of The Galaxy is deliriously, insanely its own thing, possessed of an idiosyncratic, intimate sense of humour and a magnificently diverse cast, all of whom find exactly the right tone of low-key commitment. Everything fits.
0.875 Guardians of the Galaxy is right up there with The Avengers as a movie that delivers all the fun and action you want from a superhero adventure. &#8233;
0.8 There's plenty of action, of course, but it's the heart and humor, delivered consistently throughout Guardians of the Galaxy, that make this tongue-in-cheek space opera the perfect fit for the 21st Century.
0.875 The most fun film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a fine start to a new era.
0.875 It's overstuffed with effects and incident, but it looks great, it feels fresh and it's sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.
0.875 Director James Gunn tosses together a dizzying blend of superhero bravado, outer-space adventure and off-the-wall comedy that introduces the strangest and most enjoyable bunch of rogues ever to inhabit the same spaceship.
0.7 The plot is bonkers, and there's way too much CGI, but the core little group of disparate characters manage to latch themselves to you, and you're in.
0.8 Gunn has helped take a relatively unknown property and made a film that will surely help blast these incredible characters to a level of fame that will spread across the galaxy.
0.95 Bravo James Gunn; he took a lesser-known comic book and spun it into the most entertaining ride I've had all year.
0.8 Guardians of the Galaxy isn't just a fun-filled, laugh-filled, ripping space fantasy comedy, it's one of the best, most crowd-pleasing blockbusters in years.
0.8 If blockbusters are the cinematic equivalent of junk food, then 2014 has been a goddamn ice-cream sundae, and Guardians is the bright, sickly sweet cherry sitting on top.
0.6 The cast are clever at filling in the gaps the story has to carry, with the romantic attraction between Peter and Gamora, which begins with some hearty hand to hand combat, given more emotional weight than the dialogue allows for.
0.8 It all happens about 100 times faster than the original Star Wars while taking itself about 1,000 times less seriously than the Star Wars prequels.
0.5 The film begins to stumble, then, once the focus shifts to a narrative that's almost distractingly convoluted...
1.0 A piece of wit that makes it's own niche within the genre. This galactic treat is new world.
0.9 Haters STFU, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is cinematic nirvana...
0.7 It might ultimately break down to nothing but empty calories, but it is always full-on fun. I repeat: always.
0.6 Fans... will delight in the wisecracks offered by Rocket (Rocky Raccoon) or the profundities of Groot.
0.8 I think they've really created characters, James Gunn and co-writer Nicole Pearlman, and I think the screenplay is really lovely.
0.75 ...Groot easily steals the show...equal parts 'Farscape,' 'Firefly,' and the few family-friendly parts of 'Pitch Black' while putting an original spin on it.
0.5 ... retro space opera plays more like a bad spoof of a 'Star Wars' spoof &#8210; and even then it's closer to 'The Adventures of Pluto Nash' than 'Spaceballs.'
0.8 Hovering between irony and sincere enthusiasm, the film is above all a triumph of tone.
0.8 An exciting thrill-ride that strikes a brilliant balance between jaw-dropping space scenes, anarchic wit and bountiful belly laughs.
0.6 Like so many elements of this film, this narrative arc is all too familiar. But it's fun to watch it played out with such B-movie gusto.
0.7 Think a wild ride through an amusement park with five crazy friends. Or Star Wars meets Flying High.
0.8 What makes James Gunn's scruffier and un-spandex'd band of reluctant heroes so appealing is how they approximate the good-hearted rogues on the raggedy charm of space westerns like Joss Whedon's own "Firefly".
0.8 The best Star Wars film since 1980.
0.8 When Guardians of the Galaxy is firing on all cylinders, you'll think there's nothing better in this world, or any other.
0.7 Far more lively than anything in the last three Star Wars; it's far closer in the constellation to the jokey heroism of Joss Whedon's Serenity than George Lucas's New Age sky-piloting.
0.6 Outre, cheerful, yes... but wake me up when the Doctor Strange movie is ready.
0.5 Guardians of the Galaxy is the brave new world of cinema.
0.875 A mad act of absurd genius.
0.8 Rip-roaring, irreverent and so much fun, Guardians of the Galaxy succeeds in not only introducing and connecting these relatively unknown characters into the Marvel pantheon, but in making it one of the most enjoyable and unforgettable of the bunch
1.0 The most purely entertaining movie of the summer.
0.75 Director and co-writer James Gunn brings a giddiness and a wondrous, endless sense of why-the-hell-not? possibility that's reminiscent of Star Wars.
0.75 It's the movie's rollicking good cheer that ultimately might help endear it to folks who otherwise wouldn't know the Guardians' Rocket Raccoon from The Beatles' Rocky Raccoon.
0.8 Sci-fi hasn't been this fun since Star Wars and it hasn't been this funny since Galaxy Quest.
0.8 Guardians of the Galaxy may blast off another successful franchise for Marvel, but it has a few parsecs left to go before it can truly claim greatness.
0.9 There have been few must-see films of the 2014 summer season, but Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely one.
0.8 Goofy, energetic, space-faring fun.
0.875 Guardians of the Galaxy is a total treat - funny, exciting, filled with great effects, and containing a few welcome moments of emotion. This is the Marvel movie I can see myself watching again and again.
0.875 The audience applauded. All ages, all walks of life, got hooked on a feeling - a feeling of delight - that 'Guardians of the Galaxy' delivers.
1.0 With the freedom afforded by the obscure source material, Gunn reminds us that blockbusters don't have to take themselves too seriously.
0.7 Guardians succeeds when it proves the Marvel formula is malleable; it fails when it discovers that formula is not yet malleable enough.
0.8 A rollicking carnival ride halfway across the universe and back that leaves you with a big, goofy, satisfied smile when it's over.
0.8 By Friday night, anyone who has seen this first "Guardians" will be speaking volumes about all its future possibilities, especially big-name actors scampering to hop aboard for a potentially huge and long franchise ride.
0.6 Entertaining, clever and often quite funny.
0.8 Marvel's sci-fi adventure has it all: laughs, action, charm.
0.875 A Marvelous sci-fi adventure that flies by in a whoosh of nimble action and colorful characters.
0.8 By playing with sci-fi and comic book cliches and assembling a charismatic and likeable cast, Guardians of the Galaxy is a welcome return to form for Marvel.
0.89 [It's] the first of the MCU properties that didn't feature a major Marvel character. Surprise, surprise, when you make the most enjoyable space opera romp since The Fifth Element, name recognition just doesn't matter.
0.6 Where it does work is in the lightness of touch director James Gunn brings to proceedings.
0.6 While not all superhero films are created equal, this comic-book space adventure adaptation is just good enough.
0.9 By refusing to follow the usual formula, filmmaker James Gunn has made Marvel's best-yet movie, a summer action-adventure that provides more cinematic fun than the rest of the year's blockbusters rolled into one.
0.75 After a summer of slick, seamless superhero, monster and robot blockbusters, there's certainly something to be said for a movie that feels reckless and messy.
0.875 "Star Wars" for a new generation.
0.75 Gunn delivers a pageant of eye candy splashed with the primary-color palette of his funnybook source material. He has the aesthetic down, if not always the mechanics.
0.9 It's like watching a 'Star Wars' movie filled with nothing but Han Solos.
0.8 It taps into what the first three Star Wars films knew and the next three forgot: big heart and a sense of humor are what keep heavy machinery running smoothly.
0.8 There's lots of action, incredible 3D, all the bells and whistles audiences expect from a tentpole film. But it's the brilliant humor that will help Guardians undoubtedly be one of the biggest hits of the year.
0.75 I could watch a "Guardians" movie that's just the five of them sitting around a table with a pitcher of beer and a deck of cards. Hard to say that about the X-Men.
0.6 If you want a superior successor to Red Dwarf, Blake's 7, Star Wars and, yes, Scooby Doo then look no further. There are worse things.
0.8 Finally, some jokey superheroes.
0.75 Guardians of the Galaxy is an open fire hydrant of a summer movie: more fun than should be allowed in such hot weather.
1.0 A wisecracking raccoon is saving the summer.
0.8 Um filme que se permite rir das proprias bobagens, mas que, para isso, adota uma estrategia narrativa inteligente.
0.8 It turns out to be the goofy and action-packed antidote to most of the summer's blockbusters.
0.75 I'm disappointed that I didn't like it as much as everyone else, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it. I thought it was fun. It's decent. It just didn't blow my socks off.
0.9 Gives the summer a nice adrenaline shot.
0.75 Though based on a comics series launched in 1969, "Guardians" comes on with a hip, absurdist humor that feels thoroughly modern.
0.8 This swashbuckling space age romp treats saving the universe as just a bit of fun. Very refreshing and probably just as well.
0.75 The breezy, character-piloted Guardians of the Galaxy shows a Marvel comics film need not offer big stars (at least visible ones) to entertain.
0.625 Good versus evil's romp through space reeks of Star Wars and Star Trek, with a worse plot and better effects.
0.75 The characters are great and the movie is often very funny.
1.0 Entertaining in this or any galaxy. It's certainly the most fun I've had in a theater this year.
0.6 It favors jokes and general weirdness over heroism and action, and it's less indebted to Star Wars than the cheap, junky Star Wars knock-offs that followed in its wake.
0.6 As directed by James Gunn, Guardians of the Galaxy never takes itself seriously and it's often a visual and musical treat. The Runaways' Cherry Bomb and David Bowie's Moonage Daydream? Yes, please.
0.875 Without being shackled to fanboy expectations of how iconic costumed characters should be depicted, filmmaker James Gunn ("Super") runs wild with the opportunity.
0.9 a rip-roaring good time
0.75 The motley crew's repartee makes for comedy that's surprisingly consistent, yet freewheeling and sharp enough to pinball from Kevin Bacon to Jackson Pollock and back.
0.75 Lurches along a bit awkwardly, but always with utterly dazzling visuals and a goofy gag at the ready.
0.625 If nothing else, Guardians feels like an invigorating throwback to the pop-culture properties that were Saturday-morning staples in the 1980s.
0.75 What a joy it is to be present at the birth of a new franchise! Like human birth, it's messy and emotional and full of promise. And as long as there are no problems with the delivery, it's a fresh start.
0.875 What sounds like a strained miscalculation turns out to be one of the most shamelessly enjoyable pranks ever pulled by a multibillion-dollar entertainment conglomerate. This is what happens when blockbuster filmmaking sits on a whoopee cushion.
0.7 You can have the Avengers' supergroup of professional heroes and egos: I prefer the Guardians' garage band -- rowdy and rough-edged and a real family.
0.625 This movie lacks the charm and genre affection that Galaxy Quest provided in buckets.
0.75 For all that doesn't work, a lot does and hopefully with time and distance, Gunn and his collaborators can chuck all of the non-silly stuff they just don't need for Guardians 2. They've got a firm foundation to build off of.
1.0 If you're old enough to remember when sci-fi and comic books were fun, "Guardians of the Galaxy" will be your new favorite movie. If you're not, it will set a standard for everything you see.
0.875 Guardians of the Galaxy does the impossible. Through dazzle and dumb luck, it turns the cliches of comic-book films on their idiot heads and hits you like an exhilarating blast of fun-fun-fun.
0.85 It's been billed as the most out-there, bizarre and wacky of all the Marvel Studios films. Fortunately for comic book fans and audiences looking for a little something different it exceeds expectation to be the most fun-filled Marvel movie yet.
0.625 It's like the silly, superhero-loving kids goofing off in the back of the classroom looked at The Avengers and X-Men and declared, "Hey, how hard can it be to save the world? Let's do it too!"
0.6 Marvel may not see Guardians as its prize asset, but this could be the start of a truly awesome franchise.
1.0 What is most appealing about "Guardians" is its swagger and devil-may-care panache. ...
0.8 What does work is everything about the Guardians themselves, and almost everything that comes out of their mouths.
0.5 There's a strong, likeable start to Guardians of the Galaxy, but from there, the movie begins a persistent slide into anonymity.
0.8 It's preposterous, ridiculous, bizarre. Whatever. It's not the most accessible Marvel outing, and it'll take the fanboys to spread the word; Guardians of the Galaxy is balls-out fun.
0.5 In place of wit, "Guardians" offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it.
0.875 "Guardians of the Galaxy" is pop film-making at its purest.
0.75 Guardians of the Galaxy is too loud, too long and too busy but - here's the good part - also wonderfully silly.
0.8 A fun, lighthearted confection that knows exactly what it wants to be and how to execute that mission.
1.0 It's the funniest of any Marvel movie yet, lending the film a lightness that goes a long way toward deflating the grandiosity that sometimes inflates and bloats the studio's films.
0.875 What Gunn does here better than any Marvel movie since the first "Iron Man" is to connect his movie with the reason fans love comic books in the first place: because they're fun.
0.75 In many respects, "Guardians" ... is a fun and relatively fresh space Western.
0.7 I didn't care about the plot for a second- but I appreciated the over-arching spirit of fun. And the two CGI characters are the best parts of the movie
0.6 After token story setting the movie goes up like a firework display.
0.75 It's looser, scruffier and more overtly comic than the average Marvel action fantasy.
0.25 "Guardians of the Galaxy" brings to mind some of the most unforgettable sci-fi event movies of the last 30 years. Alas, those films are "Howard the Duck" and "Green Lantern."
1.0 To see an expensive, big-studio movie freed from creative constraints and directorial cynicism is always a rare and wondrous experience. In a season of bloated indulgence, it's also fair to call it a marvel.
0.875 Watching the zippy, ebullient Guardians of the Galaxy, you wonder "Why can't all comic-book movies be this much fun?"
0.7 A rollicking, B-movie-style adventure that doesn't need to rely on a cameo from the Avengers to secure its place in the superhero canon.
0.5 The script has its moments but it lacks the unadulterated sense of fun that was so integral to many of the earlier Marvel movies.
0.75 A vivaciously crowd-pleasing space adventure. Of all of Marvel's many Phase I and Phase II projects tackled, "Guardians of the Galaxy" is, to date, the most alive with imagination and wonder.
0.7 With its quirky humor, weirdly lovable characters, and eclectic soundtrack, there is no other Marvel film quite like Guardians of the Galaxy.
0.5 ...so stuffed with pop-culture references that if you removed them the entire movie would likely collapse.
1.0 The diverse cast of characters allows for a level of satisfying entertainment that surpasses The Avengers. Guardians of the Galaxy is an extraordinary group of A-holes everyone can cheer for.
0.875 James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy is the best Marvel movie yet. I challenge anyone who would place Iron Man or The Avengers over this action-packed and thoroughly entertaining picture that is the definitive summer blockbuster.
0.8 Gunn absolutely nails the offbeat tone of the source material, creating a sort of punk rock Star Wars that delivers big on adventure and comedy with a thoroughly entertaining cast of characters.
0.75 A summer comic-book movie that effortlessly makes you feel like a wide-eyed, happy kid again.
0.75 Guardians of the Galaxy is solid summer fun - not the mammoth epic we have come to expect from each new Marvel release, but a welcome entry into a moribund movie season.
0.75 With a tone that lands closer to clever than snarky, GOTG represents the rare comic-book movie that's enjoyable with or without sound.
0.9 Really, "woo-hoo!" just about covers it.
0.75 The plot occasionally becomes overstuffed, perhaps packing in extraneous elements in order to set up future installments. Yet the zany script by director James Gunn and co-writer Nicole Perlman is sharply funny.
1.0 Iron What? Captain Who? The Guardians of the Galaxy are here to stay thanks to a Troma-bred filmmaker crazy enough to make the movie that such a fantastical comic deserves.
0.2 Marvel puts its heart on its sleeve with a story about the healing power of friendship, but that sleeve is stained with blood, spit, and other bodily fluids.
0.625 For every scene that soars into the dizzying heights of the pop sublime, there's another that crashes back down into the mundane troughs of studio-mandated formula.
0.8 It delivers just what you'd want from a summer blockbuster. It is fast, it is fun and it is all but assured of making a mint at the box office -- and spawning sequels aplenty.
0.8 ...it has everything you want in a movie: thrills, chills, humor, heartbreak, romance, betrayal and really cool action sequences
0.8 Gunn... has found a way to bring funkiness and humanity to a galaxy-spanning blockbuster, one filled with dogfights and floating fortresses, but also with heroes quick with a quip, fast on the draw, and more than a little beaten up by the universe.
0.875 The movie knows that junk art is still art, that no one is more in need of something to speak for them than the inarticulate - and with that it takes the secret pull of comic geekdom and elevates it to a kind of bittersweet, obsessive romanticism.
0.75 ROFL
0.9 The Marvel Cinematic Universe was getting a little too safe and dangerously repetitive. Guardians of the Galaxy gleefully breaks all the rules.
0.3 Once touted as their riskiest film to date, it is artistically and politically as conservative a film as Marvel Studios has ever made.
0.875 It's the snarking and sniping among the principals that gives the picture its spark.
1.0 Guardians Of The Galaxy is one of Marvel's best films simply because it doesn't really feel like it's part of the Marvel universe at all.
0.91 Behold! "Guardians of the Galaxy" is the type of movie where every second sentence starts with "behold!"
1.0 Guardians of the Galaxy is the unranked underdog that stepped in the arena with the best comic book films ever made, and walked out of the ring with the belt.
0.5 The film is terribly overstuffed and many of the jokes get drowned out by the special effects.
0.8 Enormous fun from beginning to end.
0.8 Guardians of the Galaxy is an absolutely crackling action-adventure film, a dazzling and engaging bit of optimistic sci-fi melodrama.
0.8 This space caper has its head in the clouds and its tongue, firmly in cheek.
0.92 From the opening credits to the final reel, there's a genuine swagger about the whole film. It exudes charm and confidence throughout, and is flippant in all the best possible ways.
0.6 Guardians Of The Galaxy is Marvel-lite: a brisk and breezy superhero movie that provides plenty of visual spectacle and humour but is sometimes undermined by its own facetiousness.
0.8 To misquote Forrest Gump's mother, Guardians of the Galaxy is like a box of chocolates. Or rather, it's like a vast, family-sized festive crate of chocolates, all wrapped in the shiniest packaging, all exploding with sweetness and surprises.
0.9 Freewheeling, endlessly engaging, funny as hell, Guardians Of The Galaxy is a relentless crossfire of zingers and crazy visuals.
0.9 James Gunn succeeds at turning a relatively familiar and kinda dumb story into an impressively emotional and satisfying journey.
1.0 One of the most entertaining, fun, thrilling, heartfelt and beautiful summer blockbusters we've seen.
0.8 A rocking space odyssey that gate crashes Marvel's cinematic stable and instantly becomes the life of the party
0.8 Colourful, tongue-in-cheek fun, purpose-built for grown-up lovers of kitsch '80s science-fiction.
0.625 I predict fans will eat this up, but I was hoping for something more accessible.
0.8 Mad, marvellous and all kinds of sci-fi magical, Guardians Of The Galaxy is Marvel's riskiest but most surprising success yet.
1.0 A near-perfect mix of action, humour, imagination and wondrous special effects.
0.8 A Marvel movie hasn't been this much fun to watch since the Avengers assembled.
0.6 Whip-smart, pop-literate, self-aware humour saves the day (and the universe, come to think of it).
0.8 A brand new summer family blockbuster this may be, but it plays by old, half-forgotten rules; trimming out the clutter and cross-referencing for snappy, streamlined, Saturday-cartoon fun.
0.7 Part George Lucas and part Chuck Jones, Guardians of the Galaxy has enough scrappy heart and smart humor to make it seem like the best possible kind of product, one where the talent of all involved makes it easy to enjoy their hustle.
0.9 Possibly one of the funniest (and strangest) Marvel movies yet, James Gunn and his cast deliver an infinitely entertaining space opera that's really something quite special.
0.8 On pure entertainment value, you'd be hard-pressed to find a movie this summer as good as Marvel's latest.
0.8 Guardians of the Galaxy is a pleasant surprise from start to finish, an all-rounder of a blockbuster that excels in making us laugh as potently as it awes with its sensational action packed style.
0.4 Ultimately Angel-A never takes flight, weighted down by an overabundance of metaphysical cliches stolen from other films.
0.5 The film settles into a laid-back groove that is, how shall we say, endlessly boring.
0.8 Besson gives the movie a warmth and charm all its own...
0.5 ... a visually sumptuous, dramatically inert fable ...
0.5 A gorgeous-looking film whose crisp, black-and-white photography is unfortunately much more thrilling than its simplistic, cloying story.
0.6 Besson's black-and-white angel fantasy is a weak homage to Wings of Desire, if that's what he was shooting for.
0.4 An ultimately dull nonaffair.
0.6 It's compelling largely due to its appealing cast.
0.625 Angel-A is a not very persuasive argument on behalf of heavenly intercession, but its co-star, Rie Rasmussen, will make you believe in intelligent design.
0.5 Besson... cribs heavily from Wings of Desire and Heaven Can Wait. If he had thought of it, he would have dressed someone in an Anaheim Angels jersey to elbow your ribs that much further.
0.5 ...the characters here are so unlikable that it's hard to care what happens to them.
0.75 What's at once refreshing and disorienting about the way Luc Besson -- one of the most interesting international visionaries at work today -- handles the story is his attempt to de-romanticize one of the most idealistic and sublime formulas around.
0.875 Luc Besson returns to his roots in this delightful, funny and stylish fantasy. Shot in gloriously crisp black and white, it's also a bit of a throwback to the French New Wave for its technique and dazzling location vignettes across Paris.
0.625 You desperately want the story, and the characters, to make some kind of emotional sense. This, however, does not happen.
0.8 Besson excels at stories about rough characters who are saved through their relationship with a more civilized character (as in The Professional and La Femme Nikita). Angel-A adheres to that paradigm, but it also has more soul, humor and warmth than those
0.875 Beautifully shot and superbly acted...
0.5 [The] plot is warmed-over Capra, and it's no wonderful-life yarn.
0.5 The strained fairy tale feels like writer/director Luc Besson's effort to move beyond the pop giddiness of La Femme Nikita and The Fifth Element to a mature statement about issues important to him, but the effort overshadows the message.
0.75 Angel-A drops by most of the touristy Parisian hot spots and, shot in the glorious black-and-white of Henri Cartier-Bresson, makes them all look spectacular and gritty at the same time.
0.625 Besson's dialogue is often inane, occasionally sounding like it is copied verbatim out of a new age self-help manual.
0.625 It seems Besson can be sentimental about Paris but he's still not ready to get too romantic with people.
0.625 This Parisian fable is a talkathon, affecting a silly toughness, but the sights are good to see again.
0.5 If you'd like a look at Paris in all its splendour, look no further than Angel-A. Just be sure that in order to see Paris in all its splendour you don't mind sitting through a silly little comedy with a dopey ending.
0.25 Feels like a mash-up of It's a Wonderful Life and Xanadu, without the wholesome sweetness of the first and the campy excesses of the second.
0.5 The movie doesn't aspire to be anything but a lightweight pastiche that rehashes your memories of other, better movies.
0.375 Angel-A is all icky fantasy.
0.5 Surprise, surprise - Luc Besson envisions a celestial being as a leggy, skinny super model.
0.625 We all have our own view of paradise, but as long as Besson has Arbogast, his camera and those surreal bare Parisian streets, his schlocky heaven enchants the eye, if not the mind.
0.5 To call Angel-A unconvincing would be an Eiffel Tower-sized understatement.
0.75 The overall experience of the movie is of something fresh. And while it inhabits a pretty rough world, of Parisian gangsters and loan sharks, the film has a warm spirit.
0.625 Besson conjures up some astoundingly gorgeous visuals, mainly a dreamy, neon-drenched, throbbing Paris.
0.5 The [angel] turns out to be Stuart Smalley, parking Andre in front of a mirror so he can tell himself he's good enough, he's smart enough, and doggone it, people like him.
0.3 Angel-A is one of the most gorgeous movies I have ever despised.
0.6 An intriguing drama about a quirky leggy blonde angel who comes to Paris on a mission of mercy to show a self-destructive and petty man his worth.
0.625 Besson's sniggering conception of Angela as a pure spirit in the body of a high-end hooker is just juvenile, and Andre is, frankly, a drag.
0.625 Visually arresting but flawed. Its strongest asset is the stunningly poetic cinematography by Thierry Arbogast.
0.625 As a drama, Angel-A does not rank as a great movie, but as an homage to Paris, it is sensational. For this viewer, at least, that is good enough.
0.625 Nice as this quietly philosophical mood may be for Besson, it's a little wan for moviegoers, and following on the heels of Arthur and the Invisibles, Angel-A seems less like a detour in his career than the beginnings of a wrong turn.
0.625 If Besson's eye is Angela, though, his writing is Andre: awkward, misshapen and earthbound. Andre must learn a lesson in self-esteem that would have embarrassed Capra -- maybe even Oprah.
0.625 The beautiful black-and-white photography -- and disappointingly sappy ending -- are the only remotely sober elements here, thanks to Besson's loopy script and Debbouze's very funny turn as a loser who simply can't believe his luck.
0.7 Angel-A works as a romantic comedy about opposites meeting cute and desperate in the City of Light, whose bridges and facades are nicely rendered by cinematographer Thierry Arbogast.
0.5 Angel-A never finds the heart in a promising It's a Wonderful Life premise.
0.6 It won't hurt you, and it's easy on the eyes.
0.625 Not an especially surprising or eventful story, it is, nevertheless, a reasonably satisfying little tale of a character down on his luck who finds out that life can be tolerable after all.
0.5 In essence, you get It's a Wonderful Life meets Wings of Desire, swapping out the substance for self-help platitudes. If you can get past that, you can enjoy it as a 90-minute look at a lovely postcard.
0.7 Clearly Besson's most personal film, a gorgeous and romantic travelogue of Paris locations. Rie Rasmussen is quite glorious in her first major role.
0.7 A witty, edgy cross between Amelie and It's a Wonderful Life.
0.3 Begins as playful comedy about a crook who meets a beautiful woman and ends as dreadfully dumbed-down remake of Wings of Desire.
0.375 Besson's first behind-the-camera outing since 1999's The Messenger is as skeletal as his model-turned-leading lady.
0.6 There's as much credibility in this match-up as color on the screen.
0.75 This lighter-than-air bauble proves a pleasurable diversion indeed -- as long as that heart beating inside your chest has at least a mild propensity for the romantic. Bring a date.
0.5 full review in Greek
0.875 A visually arresting odd-couple comedy that reveals itself to be, quite literally, It's a Wonderful Life with a bimbo!
0.6 Genial performances and a pleasing plot are elevated to the stuff of cinematic majesty by Thierry Arbogast's glorious monochrome photography, which recalls the Parisian vistas of the nouvelle vague.
0.4 The whole film's easy on the eye thanks to the Parisian summer setting, photographed in creamy black and white. If only the romance wasn't so monochrome too...
0.6 The film looks terrific - Besson shoots his beloved Paris in gorgeous black and white photography that recalls both Wings of Desire and It's A Wonderful Life, both of which Angel-A happily steals from.
0.4 Good looking but tedious.
0.625 This feminist film wins laurels for close attention to detail in a radical filmmaking effort.
0.8 The uninitiated should expect more passion than polish.
0.6 Situated at an unspecified future (that seems suspiciously like the present), Lizzie Borden's debut is neither a fatnasy nor an allegory, though it has an interesting feminist idea at its center.
0.5 ...poignancy doesn't interfere with director Anderson's primary objective, which is to show people shooting each other and blowing stuff up.
0.6 Despite being hampered by second-rate special effects and too many action film cliches, Soldier does have its fun parts.
0.4 Soldier didn't deserve to be treated so harshly critics, but it didn't deserve recommendations either.
0.2 Wow. What a terrible movie.
0.4 Disappointing.
0.4 There's too little character development and no reason to care.
0.625 A doggedly simple-minded diversion of rare purity.
0.375 Everything in this film is criminally bland, except for Russell's badass attitude.
0.5 Competent and nothing more.
0.5 I doubt that Kurt Russell has ever had less dialogue to work with than he has in this film.
0.5 Soldier wants to be an intense thriller with cerebral significance, but suffers from self-seriousness and silly cliches.
0.7 A potent comic-book-style action-adventure.
0.7 Derivative, dreary and painfully silly!
0.3 For testosterone freaks only!
0.6 Yet another video game for the big screen which has momentum and a terrific set going for it.
0.3 The trick is that it could have been a treat.
0.25 When it comes to details like plot, character development, and genuine excitement, the film is lost in space.
0.0 An insipid science fiction action yarn that makes you long for the realism of Pigs in Space.
0.52 As action films go, Soldier is a bad gamble: it rolls snake eyes on every front.
0.3 This is a blood-and-bullet fest, tediously filled with lots of breaking glass, neck-crunching and spine-twisting action, and flamethrowers.
0.2 If you didn't know any better, you would think I was about to describe the plot of a Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme straight to video film.
0.25 It plays even worse than it sounds.
0.5 Skip it, if you don't like guns, explosions or Kurt Russell.
0.5 Action is everything in this sinewy, visually impressive sci-fi military adventure!
0.4 You end up hating the movie that started out so good, started out so intriguing.
0.25 Anderson's novel solution to slow-moving stretches is to add explosions. But when it comes to directing actors, he's at a loss.
0.4 Those looking for an escape from the wearing bonds of logic and sensibility could do worse, though any film featuring a professional killer named 'Todd' is surely more fiction than science.
0.375 Even taken as a loud no-brainer action movie you'll find that Soldier ends rather abruptly and unsatisfyingly.
0.375 With all the charisma and liveliness of a tree, [Russell] gives a wooden performance as a wooden character. Where's the art in that?
0.4 The action is strictly routine.
0.5 Quick, what's the first thing you do as a director trying to make yourself seem cool, besides editing the movie backwards? Right! You shoot your scenes in one continuous shot.
0.875 A quixotic film of tone-poem rhythms about the unquenchable desire for lost love.
1.0 A hypnotic and intense masterwork on grief, the afterlife, and the yearning of the soul that can turn darkness into light.
0.93 This story of angels is really an examination of what it means to be human -- in the most profound sense but via the smallest, most trivial details.
1.0 A beautiful, literate and romantic piece of cinema.
1.0 How brilliant is Wings of Desire? Understand that Peter Falk is playing himself - that is to say, he's playing actor Peter Falk, who happened to be an angel himself until he elected to become human decades earlier.
0.8 The cinematography by Henri Alekan is simply astonishing in its spare yet lyrical quality.
1.0 How much Eurobabble are you willing to endure in exchange for a look at one of the cinema's most ravishing and compassionate screen visions?
1.0 a film of sheer visual poetry and deep emotional resonance
0.875 It's hard to think of another movie of its era that makes the viewer so fully feel like a denizen of its setting; the roving, dollying, craning camera makes angels of us all.
0.875 A gorgeous and heartbreaking look at angels in Berlin.
0.9 Depending on your tastes, you'll find the film either a beautiful, moving experience, or a slow and pretentious one.
0.93 What Wim Wenders has done in his most transcendent film is not merely praise assenting angels, but embrace descending ones - we humans - as well.
0.8 While it takes a little getting used to, Wenders' look at Heaven and Earth and the tug between living an experience instead of merely observing is pleasantly haunting.
0.9 A rich, mystical near-masterpiece.
0.8 ...a fascinating and enchanting character study and moral lesson that never preaches but gently transports you to a better place and a far more comfortable feeling about life.
0.8 Wonderfully imperfect, but a gem to those willing to follow along
0.5 Startlingly original at first, Wings of Desire is in the end damagingly overloaded.
1.0 ...philosophical while still becoming hypnotic.
0.75 ...like no movie you've ever seen. At once mesmerizing and perplexing, this is a film about love and despair and the choices mortals have in dealing with each.
1.0 The film evokes a mood of reverie, elegy and meditation.
0.875 In film after film, Karloff functioned as a wanderer in the shadow land between life and death. If the movies he inhabited sometimes were considered juvenile, the subject matter that motivated them couldn't have been more adult, more profound.
0.2 I died a little bit inside.
0.4 Richelle Mead's sharp series of young-adult novels might have been better off being adapted for longform TV, rather than the big-screen blunting they cop here.
0.2 Joining the painful list of Goth-drenched Twilight franchise wannabes - Mortal Instruments, Beautiful Creatures, Dark Shadows - comes a half-baked, yappy stab at blending sexy Undead girls into a teen high school comedy..Even hardcore Goths will be bored.
0.2 I thought it was a complete mess. I thought the teenage dialogue was puerile and that was a shame because Daniel Waters wrote the screenplay for HEATHERS, which is one of the really nice films about school but that was a long time ago.
0.5 It is so silly, so convoluted in terms of plot, but so insouciant that it almost gets away with it. Almost.
0.2 The screenplay by Daniel Waters, the director's brother, is stuffed with puerile dialogue, all the more disappointing given that, back in 1988, he wrote one of the best school movies, Heathers.
0.5 Previous teen films from brothers Daniel and Mark Waters had a lot of bite, so it's sad their first collaboration is a toothless horror-adventure-comedy-romance motivated by The Weinstein Company's eagerness for a Harry Potter-meets-Twilight franchise.
0.4 It was almost touching to reach the end of Vampire Academy and find that it not only left itself open for a sequel, but seemed so certain of that eventuality that it set one up.
0.4 Vampire Academy occasionally plays as if it's on fast-forward, rushing from one moment to the next without providing much reason to care about what's happening[.]
0.4 It's not a complete disaster, but even the appearance of Gabriel Byrne, as Lissa's uncle Victor, fails to make much of a dent in the slapdash proceedings.
0.2 A fast-paced yet foolishly fanged fable...
0.125 When the dream sequence killing off the cast is better than everything afterward, you MIGHT have a script problem... This is why we can't have good vampire movies.
0.7 I'm happy to report that Vampire Academy is actually a pretty fun little flick that shoots for flip and actually lands there.
0.0 Makes TWILIGHT look good - something I never thought I would say about any movie ever - now please excuse me while I go wash my mouth out with soap.
0.2 Vampire Academy is just another failure in a long line of similarly structured experiences and quite frankly, the fact that there are six of these books blows my mind.
0.2 Put Robert Pattinson in Grade 12 and outfit his classmates with cleavage that would make Hermione blush, and you have a notion of the joys in store here.
0.5 Most of the time, the actors are working so hard to keep us up on developments in the plot that they don't have time to fill in character details.
0.25 The only thing that distinguishes this teen-magnet wannabe from its predecessors is how lazily it appears to have been slapped together.
0.375 It's "Twilight" as directed by Mark Waters, of "Mean Girls." It's an idea that might have been intriguing 15 years ago, before those movies existed.
0.3 If a supernatural teen film ever required CliffsNotes, it would be this one.
0.4 Vampire Academy will likely only satisfy fans of the books. To most everyone else, it's another disposable addition to the growing pile of cheap YA movie adaptations.
0.0 One idea, mixed with lame jokes, and stretched beyond coherence. Vampire Academy doesn't need a review. It needs a stake in the heart.
0.6 For the target audience - teen girls likely to spend as much time gossiping in the theater lobby as they are to actually watch the movie - "Vampire Academy" is pure catnip.
0.125 If I laughed once more, I would have laughed once.
0.5 Only a fraction of the scores of attempted jokes work, but it's still funnier than it has any right to be.
0.3 Mark Waters' 'Vampire Academy' is a tedium of heavy exposition, tired pop culture humor and some of the lamest vampires ever...
0.2 Hard to believe the same Daniel Waters who wrote HEATHERS wrote this. The mythology here is hilariously convoluted. Also- the subtext about the Dhampirs being content servants (slaves even) is more than a little odd.
0.2 a stink bomb like this requires the devotion of a true fan to not only figure out what's going on, but why we should care in the first place
0.6 You're not going to get stellar acting or brilliant writing, but for a fun 90 minutes with pizza and popcorn, you can do a lot worse.
0.7 The 'found footage' horror movie Apollo 18 recycles the premise of The Blair Witch Project on the moon and still manages a few good scares.
0.375 "The cheap frights don't deliver, the performers bring no pathos and the gimmick behind "Apollo 18&#8243; flat out does not work."
0.2 It's impossible to recommend Apollo 18 to anyone but the most staunch found-footage fans. The film fails every requirement of a tense and enjoyable time at the theater.
0.5 "Apollo 18" is another dud in a genre that should have stopped before it got out of hand.
0.35 Feels like nothing more than an attempt to cash in on a trend, and it's a textbook example of how not to do that.
0.125 An astonishingly incompetent and interminable piece of work...
0.3 Apollo 18 is a mercilessly dull movie that just doesn't make much sense. It's light on thrills, and the found-footage gimmick works against the tension.
0.6 if you can push past the suspension of disbelief, it's a pretty eerie ride
0.75 Movies with 'found footage' have become quite popular since the advent of 'The Blair Witch Project.' The authentic feel adds to the horror element as these movies unfold. (One great example is 'The Last Exorcism,' a sadly under-seen movie.)
0.7 There are a couple of moments here that are as marrow-freezing as anything in Blair Witch or Paranormal Activity.
0.6 A simple sci-fi horror with just enough scares to keep you interested.
0.2 I can only assume this movie is for people who know virtually nothing about the space program.
0.2 [A] zero-intensity space bore.
0.4 Apollo 18 has some nice ideas, some impressive effects work and a decent finale, but the first half is extremely dull and it's ultimately let down by frustrating sound design work, severe pacing problems and some incoherent editing.
0.5 Apollo 18 is an intriguing, if never enthralling, fusion of period space-flight procedural, conspiracy theory, and monster movie.
0.8 [It] really delivers a fun, tense experience.
0.6 Will bring back a lot memories for anyone who lived through the space race.
0.4 For the most part, alas, this only goes to show that in space, no one can hear you yawn.
0.1 What we have here is Conspiracy Theory 101 all Blair-Witched-up.
0.5 Dull, but diverting if you focus on the images' eerie beauty.
0.4 So utterly broken at a conceptual level that a truly good film was completely out of the question.
0.4 The documentary look and feel of the movie is impressive until it is overcome by the inaneness of the plot
0.4 Apollo 18 always seems like an attempt at a scary movie edited by scary movie-makers, rather than an actual document from the NASA vaults.
0.25 Watching people land on the moon isn't all that interesting or photogenic, especially when we know it's pretend.
0.375 In space, no one can hear you scream ... but you'll hear plenty of giggling in the final moments of Apollo 18
0.2 It's a tedious faux documentary, filled with schlocky sound-effects and jarring cuts, utilizing TV actors masquerading as astronauts.
0.375 Boredom sets in long before the last muted shriek. And who cares about the astros? We never get to know them anyway.
0.375 For most horror fans it will be kind of a snooze.
0.4 It's not awful - you just wish they'd made a proper movie out of it.
0.3 Meticulous in its "found" visual details, minorly smart in concept, painfully slow to actually watch and so ridiculous in its big reveal that it almost has to be seen to be believed.
0.25 The film is so difficult to watch, and it's such a chore to discern a sense of place and perspective, that it sits onscreen like a big, dead weight.
0.4 It goes to such painstaking lengths for stylistic plausibility that the end product is actually quite dull, squandering its novel 'Paranormal Activity in space' concept as a result.
0.625 One giant leap for Big Brother ... scruffy, seat-of-the-pants filmmaking. The kind of thing you don't see much any more ... could do for Lopez-Gallego what 'Dark Star' did for John Carpenter.
0.2 Accomplishes something the world wasn't really crying out for: it recreates the tedium of watching the later Apollo missions.
0.2 The film takes a startlingly long time to rev up, and even at less than 90 minutes feels thin and at moments like it is playing for time.
0.4 A potentially cool "found footage" flick that is desperately in need of a lot more brains ... or a lot more silliness.
0.375 ...let's have an end to this misbegotten subgenre of 'found footage' movies.
0.2 nauseatingly bad
0.0 Has no thrills, no chills, no scares and contains a villain, or several of them, actually, that will turn you to stone -- from boredom.
0.5 If anything, Apollo 18 lacks creative intensity. It's a very lazy attempt at bringing terror to the moon. In fact, it's not even scary, unless of course you consider a sleeping dude opening his eyes and yelling into the camera "frightening"
0.5 Even with effective atmosphere, a couple of jump scares and a spooky premise, Apollo 18 simply falls apart in the end.
0.6 More than just a lunar 'Paranormal Activity.'
0.7 Apollo 18 is a surprisingly intense, innovative and well-directed flick that made me jump out of my seat more than a few times!
0.625 Less concerned with depth and more about the strict skillfulness of capturing an increasingly queasy tone and mood. This is where it works.
0.4 No final das contas, ate mesmo os dois personagens principais se tornam apenas caricaturas de homens descontrolados e em perigo, abandonando qualquer tentativa de tridimensionalidade.
0.75 Miller never falls back on the formulas that have become the bane of too many recent action films, and his sustained cuts lend a clarity to the proceedings.
0.8 Disjointed but it still rocks.
0.75 The performances are superb. The script allows Gibson to bring a welcome new dimension to the Mad Max character, and the actor rises to the occasion.
0.8 Great goofy fun.
0.8 Good action plus Tina Turner. Welcome indeed.
0.7 This film has showier stunts than its predecessors, and a better sense of humor. It also has Tina Turner, in chain-mail stockings.
0.6 Mel Gibson proves to be a formidable warrior.
0.6 Let's face it, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome isn't terribly memorable.
0.6 The weakest of the MAD MAX films, but the Thunderdome cage match is worth viewing.
0.8 An admirable conclusion to the Mad Max trilogy: softer than its predecessors, but possessing its own unique voice.
0.7 Bartertown is convincingly detailed, and the fight in Thunderdome is thrilling, ludicrous stuff, goofy and thrilling at the same time.
0.6 Not a shade on the originals, but still action to the max!
0.6 Weakest entry in the series
0.6 A huge step down from the first two, but still watchable (if only for the action).
0.4 Despite some funky oddities and a smashing climactic chase, this pales in comparison to The Road Warrior.
0.375 Definitely the worst movie in the Mad Max series. Weakly plotted, largely a re-hash of the previous movie without even the vaguest hint of tension.
0.75 More visionary and more entertaining than the first two.
0.8 Iron Man 3 is, perhaps by default, the best comic book superhero "threequel" yet.
0.6 The movie works mainly due to its acting.
0.5 Iron Man 3 has good things in it, enough to please the series' fans -- and yet too many drawbacks to win many converts.
0.6 Downey is a brilliant actor who somehow manages to portray Tony Stark as traumatised without losing the character's laidback and comedic quality.
0.75 The film's true strength is a snappy, whip-smart wit
0.8 Robert Downey, Jr. makes Iron Man one of the most entertaining superheroes in the Marvel movie universe.
0.625 There's little doubt that Iron Man Three, in its early stages, fares a whole lot better than one might've anticipated...
0.875 A generous step up from its predecessor, the various twists aren't exactly as expected, but you'll still have fun getting there.
1.0 Packed with virtually non-stop action from start to finish, "Iron Man 3" is the best film in the "Iron Man" series and among the best Marvel-inspired films ever
0.75 This may be the lightest, most entertaining cinematic exploration of post-traumatic stress disorder yet.
0.75 The way Black surrenders the movie's edginess to the generic onslaught of flashy visuals is a mild disappointment.
0.5 A regression in the usual strong work from Marvel Studios, Iron Man 3 suffers from director Shane Black's mishandling of this popular superhero character.
0.6 The elements that were once daring are starting to feel statistically approved - and tired.
0.75 Terrorist and anxiety attacks prove equally dismaying to Marvel's 'man in a can' in this witty, satisfying sequel.
0.6 Iron Hot with action
0.75 ... best Iron Man yet thanks to Shane Black, who pushes characterization, clever plot twists, not computer effects ... Downey, for a change, drops his guard, shows the heart beneath the armor
0.8 It's the funniest superhero film, and it doesn't feel like it's pandering. That's the power of Downey, Jr. and now Shane Black.
0.3 Are you sick of superheroes? No, of course you are not, cinema audiences are lapping up any caped crusader movies. But I am, especially when Tony Stark is an angst ridden shambles suffering from performance anxiety. What's so super about that?
0.75 Yeah...it's good.
0.75 We can trust in Tony Stark, even when he's falling apart and can't trust himself.
0.6 For anyone familiar with Shane Black's work, it's not long before a strong case of deja vu sets in.
0.75 what it does it does quite well, providing a satisfying sense of escapism while reminding us that such pleasures don't have to be saturated with overkill and completely devoid of relevance
0.9 Black and Downey put a swell spin of wit into it and, in a time of superhero saturation, take a back seat to no one in reserving marquee space for their guy. Moreover, they leave you wanting more of the same, please.
0.8 Iron Man 3 displays no shortage of cocky swagger in-between - and often during - the requisite sequences of high-tech 3-D carnage.
0.4 Same old tired effects to go along with more Downey smugness.
0.7 Here, it's not the suit that makes the man; it's the man that makes the suit. And Downey is still the star that keeps it-and this multi-million-dollar movie franchise-roaring and soaring.
0.5 A lumbering half-assed attempt at self-seriousness with lots of stuff blowing up, a smattering of repartee, one excellent sequence, and a brace of uninteresting villains.
0.6 Not the best of the three but Robert Downey, Jr. is better than ever.
0.75 In the midst of various plot threads with varying degrees of contemporary relevance, Black pulls off a crazy plot twist a little more than halfway through the film that's truly inspired and solidifies it as a comedy.
0.6 With its satisfying combination of humor, action and dazzling set pieces, Robert Downey Jr. and company provide everything fans of the franchise expect.
1.0 A worthy addition to the vaunted Marvel franchise!
0.875 Iron Man 3 is a spectacularly fun ride. A superhero movie that is, indeed, super.
0.625 Like the suits Tony Stark pilots by remote throughout the film, it feels like an empty shell, all sleek and shiny and looking the part on the surface but hollow at the core.
0.75 Despite a somewhat slow start and occasional plot missteps, Iron Man 3 ultimately soars thanks to its charismatic leading man and director Shane Black's man-on-wire balancing act of humor and action.
0.625 Like Iron Man 2, the movie is generally engaging, occasionally dull, frequently cluttered, and recommended with only the greatest of reservations.
0.5 I've got 3D, but I want 4D. And 5D when it is concocted.
0.5 While not a complete failure as visceral eye-candy, Iron Man 3 substitutes schmaltz for inspiration and novelty. It's disappointing that what appears to be the franchise's last chapter goes out not with a bang, but with a shrug.
0.8 bounds with buoyant irreverence and serious suspense. The scale is large, the payoffs larger, and the sense of fun is never too far from the angst and anguish Stark endures between quips and feats of derring-do.
0.7 The film's army of digital artists deliver big servings of neuron-numbing spectacle. Anyone who thinks that's not important should avoid this film.
0.875 Thanks mainly to Robert Downey Jr.'s performance, this series remains as entertaining as ever.
0.8 They decided to make a sort of mad James Bond film...except instead of Bond, you've got Tony Stark...who, by the way, has a suit of armor.
0.7 Not quite as much fun as Iron Man the first... but there are worse ways to welcome summer than with the low-key return of an old friend in good spirits.
0.75 Iron Man is starting to run out of juice. Walk away and leave while on top.
0.8 Dare I say it's the best Iron Man film yet? I dare.
0.9 Iron Man 3 is innovative, hilarious, and crafted in the same vein of the first film. The closing act is so ridiculously good and gratifying that it'll give you goosebumps. Robert Downey Jr electrifies in the Tony Stark role yet again.
0.6 As always in director/co-writer Shane Black-and this goes back to his cantaloupe-testicled actioners of the 1980 like The Last Boy Scout: Why waste energy mocking a convention that it might be better to do without in the first place?
0.7 Yet another state-of-the-art Marvel creation that strikes an entertaining balance between heart, swagger, and volume.
0.8 As a modern commentary, as a piece of pop culture popcorn pizzazz, Shane Black has started the Summer 2013 season off well.
0.875 Iron Man 3 packs all the clever one-liners and tons of fun we expect, while contrasting that fun with an authentic sense of menace.
0.7 Iron Man 3 is not the best Marvel Studios movie, but it provides plenty of fun and excitement for both Iron Man die-hards and newly acquired Avengers fans.
0.6 Fewer playboy antics, but still plenty of violence.
0.625 Iron Man 3 feels like an exploitative mulching of present-day anxieties. The script is ambitious but not wise enough to be rightfully cathartic. It's more Cuisinart than art.
0.8 Though Iron Man 3 is a better constructed film than its predecessor, ultimately it succeeds for the same reason the first two films did -- Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark.
0.8 That is why Iron Man 3 does a very smart thing, something comic fans have always known is what makes comics great: it takes a superhero and focuses on the man.
0.8 Let the other superheroes fret over the state of civilization, Iron Man just wants you to have fun and from the look of things there are no signs of rust to slow him down.
0.75 A bit like Tony Stark himself, "Iron Man 3" crackles with personality and humanity, not caring what people may think.
0.8 A great way to kick off the spring and summer blockbuster movie season!
0.75 The movie flies by in an entertaining flash.
0.5 Iron Man 3 is a primer on how not to handle a superhero sequel--but Paltrow's abs look great!
0.75 The third time's a charmer for this Marvel franchise, thanks to a clever script and, of course, its inimitable star.
0.8 Iron Man 3 follows a psychologically tormented hero who has light-hearted fun while engaging in cartoonish mayhem and uncovering corruption that reflects on contemporary politics. If that sentence sounded like a mouthful, just imagine the movie.
0.6 The movie trades on the continuing Marvel film universe without expanding it in any appreciable way. Ultimately, you will have had enough of Tony Stark when this one ends and that's not how Tony would want it.
0.625 After a while, the steady diet of tongue-in-cheek starts to taste monotonous as day-old gum.
0.8 With great performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Ben Kingsley, this superhero adventure is a blast and a thrilling kick off to the summer of 2013.
0.625 Just like he does with those crummy Sherlock Holmes movies, Downey elevates this rather flimsy material with his sheer presence.
0.7 With a few good jokes, another committed performance by Downey and a fine one by Kingsley, this is still great fun, regardless of sequelitis and whether you're a freak-flag fanboy or not.
0.875 It's right there in the credits: We'll be seeing more of Tony Stark!
0.4 Se Tony Stark faz rir com eficiencia, seus momentos dramaticos soam rasos em funcao da sensacao de que estamos apenas vendo Robert Downey Jr. interpretando Robert Downey Jr. enquanto este vive Stark.
0.875 The most memorable moments in Iron Man 3 involve Stark's brief and hilarious, yet touching relationship with a young boy (Ty Simpkins) whose own father deserted him at 6 years old.
0.75 a surprisingly tedious checklist of Shane Black-isms
0.5 A Clunky Debut to Marvel's Phase 2.
0.8 Doesn't break any new ground or transcend its genre. But it's still very entertaining and never boring.
0.5 The biggest problem is a common one: TMVS, or Too Many Villains Syndrome.
0.7 The dialogue is a riot.
0.6 Tony still has all his fleshy angles, but his manly arsenal feels a lot smaller than it did before.
0.7 By even posing questions of identity, the film creates the kind of jeopardy we can believe in, and for a superhero movie, that is an accomplishment in and of itself.
0.75 It gives Black and his co-writer Drew Pearce ample opportunity to showcase the natural ease with which Downey creates America's snarkiest of flawed heroes.
0.5 From its anxious protagonist and the battered metal sheaths he dons to save the world to the clattering, fiery mayhem that ensues with metronomic predictability, Iron Man 3 is less a movie than a final war whoop let loose before utter exhaustion sets in.
0.625 Often entertaining yet exhausting.
0.5 If it were not for (Robert) Downey (Jr.), "Iron Man 3" would be a total disaster, undermined by a haphazard, disjointed and sloppy plot.
0.625 "Iron Man 3" suffers an identity crisis resembling that of the title superhero's alter-ego, billionaire Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr.
0.625 The action plays like a video game because, well, it may as well be.
0.65 At times reaches "Avengers" level of intensity, fun and exhilaration, which makes it all the more frustrating that a few missteps result in it simply being a good movie and not the post-Avengers game changer it could have been.
0.625 Downey is in fine comic form, especially when he's sparring with young Simpkins, who thankfully throttles back on the precociousness.
0.8 As compared to the overwrought, too-many-irons-in-the-fire second installment, Iron Man 3 proves its metal, oops, mettle, once again.
0.75 If you keep your expectations realistic, IRON MAN 3 will not disappoint. It's a great popcorn movie and a perfect way to start off the summer movie season!
0.625 But for all the clanking armies of iron knights on display to dazzle the eager kid in each of us, this summer epic rings hollow. There's no one home inside the suit.
0.6 Iron Man 3 manages to rise above its naked ambitions thanks to ... Robert Downey Jr.'s sly charm ... and Ben Kingsley's too-short and ... hilarious turn as the villainous Mandarin, a clever update on the comic-book character created in the '60s.
0.5 The film provides more of the same and nothing startlingly innovative, but what's here is good.
0.8 Even though some purists may object to some of the twists and turns Black and company have managed to incorporate, for me, these twists are what makes IRON MAN 3 standout from the pack a bit
0.625 The first film might have been able to get by on charm alone, but the mechanical feeling of this entry will more than likely leave you cold and indifferent.
0.75 The longest film in the series by a handful of minutes, Iron Man 3 certainly doesn't feel like it thanks to its briskly paced screenplay and the wise decision to place some of Iron Man's most heroic moments toward the end of the movie.
0.75 Black restores a light touch to the series, at least until the bloated finale, and puts the focus back on what has always separated this franchise from every other superhero movie: the wit and intelligence of Robert Downey Jr.
0.5 It's lightweight but slow, padded with cheap jokes to disguise how hollow it is.
0.5 [Shane] Black is the reason for the season and Downey is his Santa Claus
0.5 The "Iron Man" films turned Mr. Downey into a huge star, but the role has gradually, maybe inexorably, swallowed him.
0.8 The epic action brought nerd tears to my eyes! Shane Black delivers a witty, action-packed flick with great twists. See it in 2D as the 3D conversion lacks great depth!
0.875 It balances massive, show-offy effects with hip knowingness and quirky human touches. It's a comic-book world seen not from the viewpoint of a fanboy but a wiseguy adult earthling.
0.75 The rambunctious Iron Man 3 is a briskly paced thrill ride until about 90 minutes in, when the excitement wanes. A few late-breaking surprises re-invigorate the tale, however.
0.8 The best in this series and one of the best Marvel films overall.
0.75 "Iron Man 3" is definitely a big perk-up from the almost-but-not-quite-listless "Iron Man 2"; maybe hanging out with the Avengers was a tonic for him.
0.75 The level of acting, at one time viewed as negligible in a superhero movie, is top-notch and no one seems to be mailing it in.
0.6 Iron Man 3 is over-sized, ear-splitting and relentlessly intense.
0.8 It sharply fuses the humor and heart of the earlier films with a satisfyingly heavy-metal strength - and a darkness that's more than earned.
0.625 The new film's not great, but it's consistently involving because the tonal shifts are so abrupt.
0.6 With superhero movies, over time the mythology gets junked up with tertiary characters and leftover storylines. Tony Stark & Co. have taken the Iron Man franchise as far as it can go.
0.625 A clanging approximation of fun.
0.5 "Iron Man 3" might not be a total bust, but it does result in one big "meh."
0.85 Yeah, it's great.
0.5 This [Tony] Stark is an anonymous shadow of his former self-promoting self.
0.8 'Iron Man 3 is one of the best entries in this modern golden age of superhero movies.
0.8 Shane Black's Iron Man 3 is darker, funnier, more human, and with a few unexpected twists that will annoy some diehard fans while vastly entertaining the majority of audiences.
0.6 Black still has to hit all the required superhero beats, but he does it with as much personality as he possibly can.
0.5 A shrug of a film ... that has the diminutive stature of a DVD extra.
0.875 Downey's performance is impeccable. He gets that he's not simply playing a comic book character for the fourth time but a character who is evolving.
0.7 Downey is as funny as ever, if not more so. He ensures that Iron Man 3 is a solid installment in the franchise, and helps to make it seem, at least for a time, that it might be something more.
0.625 It's not without its payoffs; I enjoyed a lot of it. But overall last year's Avengers delivered the bombastic goods more efficiently than this year's Marvel.
0.875 "Iron Man 3' has a different feel from its predecessors, and that makes it as surprising as it is exuberant.
0.625 The best scenes are when Stark just cuts impatiently through the claptrap.
0.7 Robert Downey Jr. carries this superhero saga with his wit and clever improvised quips.
0.625 It's decent popcorn entertainment -- just fine for the summertime, but nothing more than that.
0.625 The usual winks and snarks from Tony Stark, but this edition feels fresher and funnier, thanks to writer- director Shane Black.
0.5 Iron Man loses his clothes more often than a Kardsashian.
0.6 Iron Man 3 is neither turgid nor zippy. It soars at times, and dawdles in places.
0.8 Iron Man 3 avoids fantasy in favor of a hefty helping of pulp fiction. The setup makes way for Downey, Jr.'s best work in the franchise.
0.8 Not only is "Iron Man 3" the best of the trilogy, it's the best Marvel film yet. Yes, even better than last summer's uber-blockbuster "The Avengers."
0.625 The heavy metal action could never sink the irrepressible Downey, but it weighs down the otherwise light joy of ''Iron Man 3.''
0.4 This film resembles its protagonist Tony Stark: its overblown, convoluted and seemingly disconnected to anything that has come before it.
0.8 Exciting and hugely entertaining, it's an eye-popping spectacle with suprisingly clever, whimsical dialogue and wisecracking one-liners.
0.8 The best entry in the franchise so far.
0.6 The energy bleeds out of the film; it's as if the producers were scared the crowd would riot over not enough digital fakeness.
0.4 Iron Man 3 isn't a Blockbuster, it's a Blandbuster -- boring and safe and riddled with plot holes and filled with product placement.
0.375 There's so much dumb stuff in "Iron Man 3" that I expected the credits to say, "Written and directed by Thor."
0.7 A worthy, quirky, entertaining follow-up to The Avengers.
0.875 Shane Black here replaces his once-acidic spite for government and bureaucracy with a call for corporate responsibility.
0.625 Jokier, bloodier, and a bit winded.
0.5 Paltrow, who plays love interest Pepper Potts (and in a much bigger showing here) said in an interview I heard recently ... that Downey improvised hugely in the first two films but stuck more to the script here. They should have let him flow.
0.8 Just when superhero movies faced the danger of feeling too formulaic and conventional, along comes Iron Man 3 to give the genre a much-needed kick in the spandex.
0.8 A fun summer movie experience, it's a great ride that gets the season off to a hot start.
0.7 Some eye-popping action sequences at least make this a worthy summer endeavor for movie fans, but it felt like "Iron Man 3" got such a big lead in the first half, it was content to run out the clock late in the game.
0.8 Watching Robert Downey Jr play a charismatic swaggering d*ck is entertaining. Watching him play an emotionally damaged swaggering d*ck is compelling. With huge laughs and hugely entertaining twists Iron Man 3 is easily on of the best Marvel movies
0.625 Far too much of this movie - like Tony's new toys - is running on remote control.
0.8 Polished, tart and smart, Iron Man 3 buffs up to an entertaining, subversive two hours that enjoys supplying rugs simply to pull them from under the audience's expectations.
0.8 An outrageously entertaining, CGI-soaked tale of foreboding that transforms into a good-natured send-up of everything that proceeded it, replete with gags galore.
0.8 Shorter and less self-regarding than most Marvel movies, Iron Man 3 is every bit as zippy as we might expect from the creator of Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang .
0.8 Black nicely gives us lighter and darker moments, all wrapped up in one satisfactory standalone Iron Man story ...
0.8 Changing the writer and director for this third Iron Man movie turns out to be the best thing that could have happened, because Shane Black is a much more focussed filmmaker, and he gives this franchise a badly needed kick.
0.8 Iron Man 3 is like taking a helter skelter ride through a kaleidoscope of visual effects and emotions - bumpy, bright, dazzling and confusing in equal measure ...
0.6 A no-holds-barred if uneven epic that should satisfy most diehard fans.
0.8 Comic-strip superhero movies are not exactly noted for intelligence, wit or humour. Iron Man 3 is the welcome exception.
0.9 Heartfelt and thorough yet lean and effortless, Iron Man 3 is nothing short of the best Marvel Studios film to date and a triumph for Shane Black and Robert Downey Jr.
0.4 Just things blowing up, a great big endless boring noisy confusing nothingness given occasional zip by Gwyneth Paltrow in a temper.
0.8 A very entertaining sequel that recaptures the fun and charm of the first film after the cacophonous excesses of Iron Man 2.
0.8 Feels like a singular, fully realised entity, rather than a glorified teaser trailer for another crossover feature, and has some genuinely inspired and satisfying surprises amidst its familiar trappings.
0.9 It embraces the universe it lives in without exploiting it or letting it weigh down the story, and offers its hero a personal, dangerous challenge without ever losing its popcorn charm.
0.6 It features some of the best moments of the trilogy, but it does feel a bit like a missed opportunity.
1.0 This is comic book filmmaking with the emphasis very much on the "comic" -- and further proof that it's possible to tell a meaty story full of high stakes action without getting weighed down by fanboy-courting descents into darkness.
0.9 [The film] expertly melds action, comedy and drama to become the finest Iron Man movie yet.
0.8 A fiery extravaganza that is a collision between the comic book world and Shane Black's resume of rapid fire action thrillers
0.9 Tony Stark's latest adventure is an enthusiastically exciting ride that never loses its humor or its edge.
0.8 Delivers thrilling action, witty dialogue and genuine emotion, thanks to a cleverly crafted script, state-of-the-art special effects, strong, likeable characters and note-perfect performances.
0.8 Black proves the perfect blacksmith, forging smart new tech and scenarios for the swaggering super-genius. If this does turn out to be Downey Jr.'s final solo outing, it's a very strong exit.
0.8 Fun for both fans and newbies to the comic book world, the movie may be a lengthy 129 minutes but it doesn't feel like it.
0.6 This new Iron Man movie is probably the strongest of the series. The emphasis is on flip fun all the way.
0.6 All in all, it's an enjoyable third instalment that keeps the Marvel juggernaut on the road...and also underlines who's the real (metal) star.
0.8 Funny, twisty and thrilling, this is shellhead's most entertaining solo flight to date.
0.8 Thanks to director Shane Black (who also co-wrote the script with Drew Pearce), it's a film that rejuvenates the franchise while having some fun with superhero convention into the bargain.
0.8 A summer blockbuster that, in this era of saturating trailers and set-piece spoiling TV spots, genuinely takes you by surprise.
0.9 Iron Man 3 is the Marvel film-verse breaking new ground, and it's easily the best of the trilogy.
0.9 The Iron Mans have always innately had the superhero secret formula ... but this instalment is even funnier and more thrillingly action-packed than its predecessors.
0.8 One of the great surprises of the movie is Kingsley's turn as the Bin Laden-ish bad guy, hamming it up and giving Stark a reality check on who's to blame for all this.
0.8 'Iron Man 3&#8242; occasionally feels a little contrived - but then, if you're dealing with one of the best action directors around, you can expect him to draw on the style that he knows best.
0.6 Go for the thrilling action and hilarious Shane Black one-liners. As for a compelling story and entertaining villains? Not so much.
0.7 A lighter variation on the deconstructed superhero mythology found in The Dark Knight Rises.
0.6 Iron Man 3 carries that 'morning after' feeling former playboy Tony Stark is no doubt familiar with... There are plenty of great moments, but it barely hangs together as a film.
0.8 A witty and rather surprising take on the superhero movie.
1.0 Superhero movies just don't get better than this.
0.8 In the annals of superhero movies, this is not the most thrilling, but it does contain two Downton Abbey jokes, and a stonking performance from Downey.
0.6 It's undeniably entertaining - and worth seeing for Kingsley alone - with the misfires never fully overshadowing the moments of glory.
0.8 To use a recondite term in professional film criticism: whoo-hoo!
0.8 Black has an instinctive feel for balancing action set-pieces against the passages of soap-opera that are required to make them matter.
0.25 The first rule of a sequel should be: Do NOT destroy the happy ending of the previous film.
0.2 Manages to lack ALL the surprising creativity of the original. It's actually very, very terrible.
0.75 Overall, this is a solid, distinctive and sometimes exquisitely inspired thriller-and-beyond.
0.9 It's a wicked, violent parable, and one of the only movies of the summer worth talking about after the credits roll.
0.8 It's literally a hell of a ride -- Brazil meets Murder on the Orient Express.
0.8 I enjoyed every bonkers, goofy, cartoonish, creative moment of Snowpiercer.
0.4 Fueled by implausibility, and for a good portion of the ride much better for it, Bong-Joon Ho's Snowpiercer posits a nonstop, Earth-encircling train containing the microcosmic survivors of a society killed off by a global warming-induced deep freeze.
0.8 The setup may be high-concept times a thousand, but the obviousness of the symbolism is so inextricably interwoven with the forward momentum of the plot and so well complemented by Joon-ho's comic-book style and sick humor, you can't help but buy in.
0.9 Snowpiercer's ultimate victory is how palatable it makes its unbelievably weird material.
0.875 In a world full of Divergents and Hunger Games and 2012s, Snowpiercer not only has the confidence to ask difficult questions -- it also has the courage make the viewer answer them for his or herself.
0.9 This is a dark, but deeply beautiful movie, punctuated by edge-of-your-seat thrills and unexpected laughs.
0.875 This is powerful stuff, and all the more so for its straightforwardness.
0.8 A refreshingly smart thriller, its geopolitical savvy mingled with a wholly unique look, Snowpiercer is quite the dystopian choo-choo.
0.6 ...a bloody, limb-severing action film with a bitterly malevolent view of the species.
0.875 There's a righteous savagery to this movie that's almost but not quite obscured by the lushness of its imagined world.
0.875 As it circumnavigates the frozen globe of the climatic post-apocalypse, 'Snowpiercer' sometimes seems loaded with more allegorical freight than even a futuristic bullet train can carry. Yet it remains one of the year's more impressive films.
0.8 Snowpiercer wears its inspirations on its sleeve, but the cumulative effect of it all results in something truly unique. It may not be The Host, but it is something I've never seen before, and that is a treat in itself.
0.8 An environmental, post-apocalyptic, revolutionary-uprising sci-fi action movie on a train. Sub-genres don't come much more specific than Snowpiercer.
0.75 It is the most frigid movie to come along since Dr. Zhivago.
1.0 A mastery of form and commentary.
0.875 a taut social allegory about class and power cleverly packaged as an exhilarating action thriller
0.7 Although it is based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige ... Snowpiercer is the best video game movie ever made.
0.7 It's very much part of a cinematic tradition: heir to the hermetically enclosed, purpose-built steampunk dystopias devised by Terry Gilliam and Guillermo del Toro and Caro & Jeunet.
0.5 Loftily pretentious, though curiously amusing arthouse action movie.
0.8 The world has ended in film after film in recent years, but rarely has the aftermath been such impressive viewing.
0.5 Often inspired, sometimes lethargic adaption of a French graphic novel, funded mainly by the Korean government and starring a panoply of British thespians and [Captain America himself]. An awesome 90 minute movie lurks within these very bloated 126.
0.75 Snowpiercer alternates between sudden violence, high camp, and heavy-handed political allegory with breakneck speed, and even when its disjoined plot mechanics seem a little too convenient, it's brimming with new cinematic technique.
0.8 At the dramatic center of SNOWPIERCER is this metaphorical concept of balance. We're taken on a journey to the front of a futuristic train, learning about an ecosystem that travels roughly over icy tracks. It's a ride worth taking.
0.9 The undisputed star of the show... is Korean director Boon Jong-Ho. Rarely does a vision so ambitious and raw hit the screen with such clarity and force.
0.7 No question I would recommend it and people have got to see it on the big screen.
0.8 This is a beautifully made science fiction allegory about the perversions and arrogance of power.
0.875 It's so hard to describe how amazing Snowpiercer is without giving away everything that makes it amazing.
0.8 A confronting think piece wrapped in a bizarre and bloody thrill ride.
0.75 The absolutely watchable vibe comes to an almost dead stop as the movie enters its anti-climactic third act...
0.4 One of the biggest problems is the train setting. We're supposed to be in constant motion, but half the shots are entirely still.
0.875 You couldn't ask for a better metaphor for hell on Earth than what Bong Joon-ho has wrought with Snowpiercer: constant forward momentum while getting absolutely nowhere, suffering all the while.
0.875 Snowpiercer features uneven performances, but gets great mileage from its set design, the sheer audacity of the premise, and the appearance of one of those movie villains who seem able to take lethal punishment without actually dying.
0.8 Snowpiercer feels both heightened and grounded, allegorical yet familiar, able to be experienced. The confined space in no way inhibits tension or excitement, or a sense of forward momentum. It's a film not to be missed.
0.875 Suddenly zombies, nukes or a global pandemic don't seem nearly as devastating as a train ride to nowhere.
0.875 A movie-movie, with edgy cred and a vivid dystopian vision that, while ostensibly futuristic, speaks harshly to the class divide already defining us.
0.9 Every moment of genius and every half-formed lump alike make this one of the completely essential films of the year.
0.875 It emerges from a place of fearsome ambition, dressed in the skin of a zealous summer blockbuster but equipped with a brain that far exceeds the standards of its classification.
1.0 Snowpiercer hits the sweet spot of working as entertainment while still having enough brains to keep you intellectually engaged. It's a movie for people who love movies that play by their own rules.
0.9 A film full of both wonders and horrors, rendered beautifully and hugely.
0.875 ...the film becomes a horrifying, social commentary that bites close to the bone.
1.0 In a word, 'Wow!' Bong Joon-ho's Snowpiercer, is near the very top of 2014&#8242;s "Best of" list -- at least so far, and I can't imagine it slipping out of the top five.
0.875 The element of surprise is the most effective weapon in Joon-ho's directorial arsenal.
0.875 One of the few surprises of the Summer and one that deserves a much wider audience.
0.9 Utterly surreal and completely mental.
0.875 The future is miserably dystopian as usual in this apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, but at least it's thoughtful, stylishly crafted, high-speed misery that keeps on hurtling relentlessly forward -- even though there's nowhere to go.
1.0 Within the space of a 60-foot-by-9-foot train car, "Snowpiercer" packs in more action, inventiveness, energy and ideas than most summer blockbusters that have whole galaxies at their disposal.
0.88 ...has about it a gorgeous incoherency that overwhelms any logical objections to its absurd premise.
0.875 It pummels forward like the train on which the action is set, and you don't particularly want to reach the end.
0.8 An object of blunt force and breath-catching beauty, Snowpiercer plays what-if with a familiar doomsday scenario: What if Noah's ark never found dry land again?
1.0 It's a bleak, shocker of a movie, but one laced with just enough black humor to make the harsher parts even bleaker.
0.85 Besides the impressive visuals, the film makes relatively solid use of its impressive cast.
0.3 Snowpiercer is Throw Momma and the Kitchen Sink off the train.
0.75 If you can buy the premise of this Bong Joon-ho graphic novel adaptation, you're in for a good ride.
0.7 The Taking of Swinton One Two Three.
0.8 Exciting, edge-of-your-seat action thriller - a wild ride that's one of the best of the year, so far.
0.5 It's a dumb idea on its surface, and as we get deeper and deeper into the concept, at no point does the screenplay ... make us believe it is anything more than that.
1.0 "Snowpiercer" delivers tension, and surprises in ways that belie the conventional wisdom that blockbuster action movies must be brainless, soulless enterprises.
0.7 The political message of Snowpiercer is delivered without much finesse, but Bong succeeds in other ways.
0.9 Bong's top priority is to deliver a meaty, satisfying action adventure, and he succeeds there like the world-class filmmaker he is.
0.875 In the thick of summer, while Hollywood is busy cranking out cookie-cutter superhero movies and giant robot sequels, along comes Snowpiercer to show everyone how it's done.
0.85 The concept of Snowpiercer isn't entirely unique as it does feel familiar, but its enthralling presentation surrounds the film with fascinating characters and exquisite performances.
0.875 A rococo exercise in mayhem, boldfaced allegory and ramped-up chaos. It's a summer movie with a social conscience.
0.9 Although there is plenty to think about here, it's best not to overthink it. Just hang on and enjoy the ride.
0.875 "Snowpiercer" is a rich, ravishing experience, a motion picture dripping in social consciousness and thematic intricacy without becoming preachy or losing sight of its other purpose as a rousing, robust entertainment.
0.75 "Snowpiercer" is a welcome curiosity in a season of formula-driven, copycat genre films.
0.7 The dystopian world he envisions is incredibly immersive and extremely thrilling....but maybe some of those edits should have been kept in.
0.875 A formidable, if perversely overlong epic, Snowpiercer is a dystopian moral parable about survivors of a second ice age that wipes out virtually all humanity.
0.6 The production design is sharp and unique, though the movie itself is not without its flaws.
0.8 In different hands, Snowpiercer might have been just another generic action movie. Yet with South Korean director Bong Joon-ho at the helm, it's instead something more off-kilter and more disturbingly satisfying.
0.625 Subtlety may not be the film's strong suit, but it creates a richly imagined world, as glitteringly arresting as it is savagely merciless.
0.875 "Snowpiercer" is a full-throttle science fiction adventure and a resonant modern myth.
0.875 Thrilling, visceral sci-fi action pic with a sharp satiric bite
0.9 A unique vision, strong execution (in action, wit, and humor) as well as compelling characters culminate in one of the year's best dark horse hits.
0.8 SNOWPIERCER is a big film with a large cast, but Bong brilliantly juggles fights, characters, and ideas -- including a savvy use of food -- and fits it all succinctly within his amazing visual design and scope.
0.75 From a dramatic standpoint, the film is equally effective in the way that it includes the expected pulpy thrills and weirdo humor but also some unexpectedly affecting dramatic moments.
0.75 For the longest time "Snowpiercer" rushes forward, like the bullet train itself - sleek and swift and unstoppable. And it takes us along for the ride.
0.875 Snowpiercer is a rare hybrid that perfectly blends the dazzle of a futuristic action thriller with the intellectual substance of an art film.
0.75 The train, and the picture, barrel along to an apocalyptic climax that will leave you shaken and chilled.
0.8 This is a terrific, dark dystopian nightmare mixed with flashes of Terry Gilliam-esque absurdity and the filmmaker's own fractured frame of reference.
0.75 This is exactly the sort of ambitious, audacious, and uncompromising filmmaking that deserves to be seen.
0.875 Snowpiercer is everything Transformers: Age of Extinction wishes it could be: a slambam sci-fi thriller with a brain, a heart and an artful sense of purpose.
0.8 [Bong Joon-ho] lays out class sideways, one section at a time, so that by the time you get to the people lounging in Jacuzzis or clubbing, it's impossible to avoid outrage.
0.75 It's a film that, in its own peculiar way, forces viewers to question their values and ask themselves how much they're willing to sacrifice for a functioning society, and how much is too much.
0.8 By the time "Snowpiercer" closes we've been guided through an exhilarating, videogame-fighting infographic of the post-globalization world ecosystem: climate change, child labor and population control. And it's fun, too!
0.6 The nihilism would be cooler if it felt like more was at stake. But if you settle in, it's one wild ride.
0.875 Don't miss it - this is enormously fun visionary filmmaking, with a witty script and a great international cast.
0.75 I'm not sure where the line is between a good gonzo movie and a creative mess, but I know that Snowpiercer is on the right side of it.
0.8 A dystopian masterwork illustrating the moral rot of dividing the population into a winning class versus everybody else as poor scum of the earth.
0.875 If you love movies, you can't afford to miss it.
1.0 Sprung from a 1982 French graphic novel and bearing its era's trickle-down tensions, Snowpiercer is a headlong rush into conceptual lunacy-but you'll love it anyway.
0.8 Projecting the problems of today into a science-fiction tomorrow, [Snowpiercer] also ties them to a compelling story that keeps shifting under its characters' feet.
0.8 Bong brings enough straight action to the mix that even those put off by the more bizarre characters should ultimately dig what he's done with the material.
1.0 Against all odds, though not totally unexpected given the director's previous skill with the erratic, the end result is quite spectacular.
0.8 An entertainingly off-kilter slice of pulpy mainstream filmmaking, executed with humour, verve and vision.
0.625 The film preaches resolutely to the choir, and cinephiles in sync with the film's politics may still blanch at how snugly their interests are courted.
1.0 Echoing the dystopian brilliance of Blade Runner and Brazil and beset by remarkably similar studio wrangling over the final cut, Snowpiercer is an audacious, immersive and nightmarish masterpiece.
0.8 Snowpiercer works brilliantly, the sum of extremely disparate parts that adds up to cinematic excellence.
0.92 Roaring action, thoughtful geekery, and a knockout performance by Chris Evans send Snowpiercer speeding out of the station and into the sci-fi history books.
0.74 If the film has one element that never flags or falters, it's Evans.
0.4 Snowpiercer is leaden and confused, an all-star disaster of a movie, of interest only to connoisseurs of expensively botched sci-fi money-pits.
0.6 Once the action heats up, Bong delivers a rich feast of political allegory and bloodthirsty carnage. Snowpiecer is no masterpiece, but an agreeably unorthodox, impressively arty blockbuster.
0.8 A nightmare inducing, violent collection of left wing fears enhanced and packaged into a madcap post-apocalyptic movie unlike any other of its kind.
0.6 Snowpiercer is an ambitious and stylishly designed slice of dystopian sci-fi, yet it is also incomplete, filled with shallow characters and unexplored ideas.
1.0 Though completely absurd in many ways, Bong's handling of the source material is so expertly done that we're completely immersed in this tale, allowing for ourselves to be taken wherever the South Korean director sees fit.
0.4 Probably the worst of the Critters series (and that's saying something).
0.6 Just as good as its predecessor ... which was actually a pretty good time!
0.6 Almost as good as the first film, it's alone worth seeing for the return of Terrence Mann as the funniest intergalactic bounty hunter in the history of cinema.
0.6 A throwback to the energetic sci-fi films of yesteryear. Frantic and Fun.
0.6 A watchable futuristic prison flick. Decent B-movie thrills.
0.6 Martin Campbell's generally an underrated action director, but this is just okay, not one of his finer efforts
0.9 Outlaw Prophet is a work of warped genius that has to be seen to be believed.
0.4 Enough sequels, please!
0.6 As far as sequels to mediocre movies go, this one's okay.
0.4 Another forced and charmless sequel spawned from a surprisingly fun flick.
0.45 The Collapsed manages to corral its literary pretensions well enough that it manages to avoid embarrassing itself.
0.3 All the movie needs is more cowbell.
0.5 What The Collapsed lacks is the jolts that horror fans may prefer in their post-apocalyptic fare.
1.0 90 minutes of iconic imagery, some deep questions and a surprising amount of humor. This is Art with a capital A, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining at the same time, which only makes its artistry even greater.
0.8 Symbolism-filled classic a tough sell for kids.
1.0 The Seventh Seal is a film not about the end of time, but the silence between man and God.
0.9 Bergman's film about the actual figure of Death is one of his funniest and, ultimately, most hopeful works.
1.0 As a youth, perhaps no other film opened my eyes to the wonderful possibilities of cinema as much as The Seventh Seal.
0.5 Swedish cinema titan Ingmar Bergman's mopey/earthy 1957 breakthrough The Seventh Seal may have done more than any other film to popularize and demonize the notion of world cinema as the boutique of the cultural intelligentsia.
1.0 Perhaps no one film speaks more fully to the human condition than The Seventh Seal. [Blu-ray]
1.0 Its view of a seemingly godless landscape in the grip of plague is still bold and frightening.
1.0 still spiritually resonates today
1.0 A cinematic masterpiece no film fan should miss.
1.0 Bergman's superbly shot wintry images, much like those of a silent film, print themselves indelibly on the mind, while the Knight's search for a God who never answers foreshadows the pessimism of the director's later work.
1.0 Guaranteed to thunder on the big screen.
1.0 Ingmar Bergman's dark masterpiece effortlessly sees off the revisionists and the satirists; it is a radical work of art that reaches back to scripture, to Cervantes and to Shakespeare to create a new dramatic idiom of its own.
1.0 Ingmar Bergman's black and white masterpiece The Seventh Seal has matured like a great wine over 50 years.
1.0 Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of hopeful humanity, The Seventh Seal is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning(lessness) of this mortal coil.
0.6 Fear, peril and hoplessness soak every frame.
1.0 A grand, thought-provoking and highly enjoyable piece of cinematic history.
1.0 Dark but beautiful.
0.833333333333 Not only highly impressive but thought-provoking, relevant and intensely moving in our present, nervous, times.
0.625 It manages some powerful images, but it feels a bit too calculated to really get under the skin.
1.0 Haunting and beautiful.
1.0 Essentially intellectual, yet emotionally stimulating, too, it is as tough -- and rewarding -- a screen challenge as the moviegoer has had to face this year.
1.0 Almost hypnotic in its power, it's a film that washes away all the parodying it has received over the years, emerging as fresh and startling today as it did nearly 50 years ago.
1.0 Great existentialism and morbid humor. Fantastic performances.
1.0 Easily, one of the greatest films ever made.
1.0 This is an uncompromising film, regarding good and evil with the same simplicity and faith as its hero.
1.0 So gripping as to be entertaining in an enlightening way.
0.4 Nicholson gave the best analysis of the film in a later-career interview: "It was incredibly bad."
0.4 Moody, not-quite-coherent suspense
0.4 Tepid, shoddy stuff despite its pedigree.
0.7 It would be quite impossible to claim is that the filmmaker's love of his subject isn't apparent throughout every lovingly-crafted frame.
0.75 The screenplay has flashes of real wit, and Perlman is perfect in the title role.
0.6 Somewhat entertaining, but too scary for many.
0.8 Hellboy both kicks butt and falls in love, in an adventure that is thrilling, funny and touching.
0.75 A strong anti-superhero movie that turns the genre sideways.
0.75 Ron Perlman--the Lon Chaney of our time--plays Hellboy with grit, humor, and a depth of feeling which, barely, grounds the movie.
0.6 They say the devil gets all the best tunes and, on the strength of this latest comicbook adaptation, he gets all the good one-liners, too.
0.8 Perlman, at age 53, strides in like a hungry young actor itching to prove something, only with 22 years of experience lending him charisma and confidence.
0.75 As expertly played by Perlman, even with tons of make-up and prostheteics, our hero is a good 'monster' whose origin haunts him to the bone.
0.75 Stylish sci-fi director Guillermo Del Toro brings Mike Mignola's stone-fisted, horny (literally!) cult comic book hero to life in this wry, glossy adventure.
0.8 An experience you can't miss.
0.5 ... a dull, derivative, poorly plotted movie. Hellboy's enemies are interesting at first, but they wear out their welcome quickly.
0.5 The trouble with computer graphics in films these days is that a computer doesn't have half the imagination of a human.
0.79 A briefly entertaining but forgettable adventure.
0.6 It hasn't got the breakout potential of less eccentric comic book heroes, but fans will thank the dark squid gods for del Toro's admirable loyalty to the source material.
0.8 Extremely enjoyable comic-book romp -- impressively directed with a witty, imaginative script and a terrific central performance from Perlman.
0.7 This good-looking superhero adventure tackles all of life's big questions -- what is the nature of evil, are genes more influential than the environment, and who would win in a fight between a shaven-horned demon and a giant hellborn squid.
0.8 It works big time.
0.6 A richly imaginative comicbook world is unveiled in Hellboy. If only the story was as strong.
0.75 'Es un buen trabajo para Del Toro pero todavia muy alejado de lo que nos tiene acostumbrados. Recomendada especialmente para fans del comic.'
0.4 Parts of Hellboy are enjoyable enough, I guess, but there's way, way too much to potentially enjoy.
0.8 Buena fotografia, excelente maquillaje, llamativos efectos y un guion inteligente para saber que no es un producto serio, sino una historieta llevada a la pantalla.
0.6 Hellboy is sort of a Denis Leary Catholic: Snarls a lot, tromps around in a grungy coat, and chomps on tobacco products continuously.
0.6 Prende a atencao do espectador gracas aos seus interessantes personagens e ao rico universo no qual estes vivem.
0.5 While Comic Book Movies may be the new fad, I'm hoping that the trend will quickly end its tenure of terrorizing the cinematic landscape.
0.6 The grim humor is ironically enjoyable and makes this film worth seeing. But neither del Toro nor Mignola knows who Hellboy should be.
0.6 Dynamic in disposition, but ineffectually conveyed.
0.8 Depths of character draw us in and make the film much more than an exercise in eye-poppingly inventive design, make-up, effects and action.
0.75 Hellboy will strike a chaotic chord with audiences that appreciate their dark and stylish comic book narratives as mysteriously inviting and highly spirited
0.6 Perlman plays the adult Hellboy to perfection: part blustery, stogie-chomping tough guy in a mean leather duster, and part angsty teenager, sick and tired of being confined to the BPRD lest his appearance incite a riot among the general populace.
0.6 I think it's worth checking out on the big screen if you're even slightly interested. I think seeing it with an audience may help.
0.75 Overall, Hellboy is a hot time in the old town, a great comic book movie writ large.
0.6 Although Perlman's presence provides the heart and soul of Hellboy, the film's fire dies down the moment he disappears from sight
0.75 ...reminiscent of both The League of Extraordinary Gentleman, but with a better story, and Men in Black, but less adorable.
0.625 Sly humor, restrained violence/language, and a terrific -- and very crimson -- Ron Perlman position Hellboy as a cut above your average Mutants vs. Nazis flick.
0.75 If you're planning to take a comic book to the big screen, Guillermo del Toro is the man you want behind the camera.
0.875 Perlman invests him with such genuine emotions -- both good and bad -- that we never for a second doubt his plausibility as a character or why he makes the choices he does.
0.6 It works basically because of Ron Perlman.
0.75 Master director Guillermo Del Toro artistically glues the fanciful bits to his celluloid canvas creating a visual feast for the imagination! Read on->
0.75 Finally, we have an excellent fresh treatment for a comic book hero.
0.5 A great concept burdened by an unwieldy back story...
0.7 It doesn't leave the "Is that it?" aftertaste that cursed Daredevil, but it definitely feels like something we've seen before ... many, many times before.
0.7 It would have been so easy to play Hellboy as caricature, but [Ron] Perlman provides the character heart, soul, and the richness of life.
0.5 This movie isn't original enough, exciting enough, or humorous enough to sustain interest, let alone spawn the expected sequel or two.
0.75 ...wickedly funny and action packed...
0.625 OK, the CGI stuff is getting better. But it still looks like CGI stuff.
0.9 As good a comic book flick as I've seen in years.
0.7 ...un heureux melange de bande dessinee inventive et de monstres 'lovecraftiens'...
0.7 Combining CG with matte paintings, models and animatronics, writer/director Guillermo del Toro fosters the fun and ingenuity that fuel this often-confusing horror fantasy.
0.875 Succeeds as a supernatural special-effects free-for-all, a no-holds-barred monster throwdown and even a love story.
0.5 Writer/director Guillermo del Toro puts too much effort on image and not enough on background.
0.75 Thanks to the singular vision of director Guillermo del Toro and Mike Mignola's gloriously dark source material, Hellboy is a wicked trip into the fantastic.
0.9 [Hellboy's] actions are believable, his issues are sympathetic, and his humor is genuinely funny.
0.75 The world created in Hellboy seems to reveal something clever at every turn...I hope that there's a sequel.
0.625 With all pro's and con's tallied, Hellboy stands as a durable popcorn entertainment with definite potential to become a franchise.
0.8 I've seen bad superhero movies before. This is not a bad superhero movie. Enjoy.
0.75 A wonderfully pulpy thrill ride full of awesome computer-generated and make-up effects.
0.8 The film hits its stride in all the moments where del Toro forgets about his silly hocus-pocus Apocalypse and lets his heroes interact and grow.
0.75 Somehow del Toro gives the movie unexpected rhythm and spirit; don't be surprised if you get caught up in this weirdly affecting tale...
0.7 This superhero character would seem to confirm the oft held view that we are molded by our environment.
0.5 [Hellboy] is gloomily gorgeous, but its tone careens recklessly between light comedy and dark portentousness and the character relationships suffer.
0.8 Easily the most adept comic book adaptation since Ghost World.
0.75 [del Toro] doesn't quite knock it out of the park like X2 or Spider-Man, but that's not because of a weak swing.
0.75 If you don't normally go to films where the lead characters look like giant Pez dispensers, the slogging fights of Hellboy may seem like purgatory. But there's enough going on in between the big action sequences to save the movie from mediocrity.
0.5 It's a movie for people (the guy kind) who can't stop turning the pages of comic books, who want life to be serialized.
0.5 Hellboy is at its best in the first half. That's when we get to watch him in action. But director Guillermo del Toro ultimately allows the film to run out of steam.
0.625 Fast, funny, and flippant.
0.4 While the character of Hellboy is entertaining, the film in which he appears is largely an exploitative jumble.
0.75 I don't know if Hellboy has had a Beauty and the Beast relationship in his comic-book life, but if he did, the filmmakers did right by him in casting Ron Perlman.
0.75 Silly stuff, to be sure, but Perlman is so spectacular that he holds it together.
0.6 A film for comic book fanatics, children and fantasy fans, but it's hardly a heavenly experience for those who prefer actual literature.
0.7 Wickedly good!
0.75 Despite its shallow feel, Hellboy still succeeds as a piece of relentless pop entertainment.
0.875 If you identified with the freakish misfits of The X-Men, you'll love Hellboy and friends. They are a helluva lot X-ier.
0.625 Surprisingly enjoyable.
0.75 Del Toro's wittiest, most visually diverse feature to date.
0.6 Guillermo del Toro's above-average if not-quite-spectacular adaptation of Hellboy sticks to this expectation-flipping recipe and retains the comic's cheeky, po-mo spirit.
0.75 Far be it from me to endorse yet another franchise, but thanks to del Toro and a smart script, Hellboy is so entertaining that you long to see what further heck this gang can raise.
0.75 The constant winking at the audience does get a little tiresome, but for the most part, the film is a fun and thrilling action piece.
0.875 Del Toro clearly knows exactly what he's doing. With the big budget of Hellboy, he was given the tools to do it well, along with the freedom to do it right.
0.875 Hellboy is one of those rare movies that's not only based on a comic book, but also feels like a comic book. It's vibrating with energy, and you can sense the zeal and joy in its making.
0.625 He's finally figured out what to do with a big budget ... Yet del Toro still hasn't figured out some basic storytelling tenets.
0.75 An action movie with a brain, a heart, the nerve.
0.7 Comic fans should enjoy the movie, but those with only a passing interest won't be as enthralled.
0.6 Essentially, Hellboy is another WWF Smackdown movie.
0.8 Perlman, who has become a modern-day Lon Chaney with the variety of monsters and weird characters he has played, has his best role...
0.75 A damned good time.
0.7 Purists may be disgruntled with parts of the story, but they'll agree that Hellboy captures the essence of the big, lovable lug with attitude to spare.
0.7 Filled with even doses of action, humor and multi-dimensional characters with heart, Hellboy is everything a comic book movie should be.
0.625 Making no apologies for the source material, director Guillermo del Toro lets his picture gorge on power bars of pop energy, sugared with sprinkles of playful humour.
0.5 I enjoyed the first 90 minutes and was ready to give this a recommend, but the last 30 minutes sent the movie straight to hell for me.
0.75 [F]eels like a genre classic for much of its running time, until it tails off sharply in its final third.
0.5 Portions of the movie capture the spirit of the clever source material, yet it eventually becomes another generic action flick bogged down by the weight of its CGI effects.
0.875 Most heroes need a cape. Hellboy needs a hug.
0.875 Hell, yeah.
0.9 This movie is an astoundingly colorful and exceedingly entertaining showcase of Demonic Superheroes vs. Slimy Monsters.
0.75 Ron Perlman is almost frighteningly perfect.
0.6 A comic book you've never heard of is brought to the big screen gleaming with enthusiasm, even if the script could have used more polish.
0.5 Hellboy is as magnificent looking a comic book film as I've ever seen, but an increased sense of boredom detached me about midway through.
0.75 Hellboy has an amazing soul and sense of drama that exceeds what you get from most comic book movies.
0.5 A fiery action picture destined to please fans of other comics-turned-adventure flicks such as X-Men. The rest of us will find ourselves left out in the cold.
0.625 Hellboy is the most engaging comic-book movie character to emerge in years, and his complex personality is perfectly personified by Ron Perlman, with a prosthetic assist.
0.6 Though there's nothing particularly new in the Hellboy narrative, it's easy to be captivated by del Toro's style and the film's overall panache.
0.75 What separates Hellboy from your run-of-the-mill comic book movie is, ironically, that it feels like it's about real people.
0.75 Hellboy is on fire with scares and laughs and del Toro's visionary dazzle.
0.7 Perlman is the best casting in the history of super-hero films.
0.6 Hellboy the character is a great deal more interesting than Hellboy the movie.
0.7 Guillermo del Toro lets loose with a vaudevillian rambunctiousness that makes his adaptation of the Hellboy comic book series daffy, loose and lovable.
0.625 If you're a Hellboy fan, the film is a must-see. For others, don't bother.
0.75 The most successful transformation from pulp page to big screen since Tim Burton's Batman in 1989.
0.75 Faithful to its pulp roots and lacking the cumbersome self-seriousness of many a comic-book adaptation, Hellboy is, well, hellacious good fun.
0.625 Visually attractive, but not much else.
0.75 A fully formed, funny, smart and briskly entertaining horror show.
0.875 A welcome change of pace from the senseless sensibilities of most Hollywood comic-book spectacles.
0.5 The movie feels at odds with itself, embracing the comics' idiosyncratic creations without an idiosyncratic worldview.
0.7 A fun monster movie.
0.625 The promise is in the premise. Next time (and after Hellboy makes millions, there will be a next time), someone just has to make good on it.
0.75 Despite several drawbacks, Hellboy nevertheless succeeds in entertaining.
0.625 (Perlman's) rumbling, ironic lilt and cynical cigar-chomping give charismatic aplomb to this supernatural superhero...
0.75 One part fierce, one part vulnerable: like the director, like his heroes.
0.6 del Toro's focus on the mood and the effects unfortunately causes the characters to suffer
0.85 Ron Perlman as Hellboy might be the best casting ever of a superhero...he's cooler than the movie is.
0.75 I've never laid an eye on Mignola's comic, but I know a good del Toro film when I see it.
0.5 A long, violent, cigar commercial that's for Hellboy comic book fans only.
0.6 If it weren't for the sag in the story's pacing halfway through that threatens to have the whole thing implode in on itself, it would be a perfect flight of fancy.
0.625 Halloween III, while not a complete success, at least offers something different from the norm.
0.8 Halloween III: Season of the Witch might have been hated back in the day, but it simply doesn't deserve the anger and animosity nowadays.
0.75 It is high time for viewers with a hang-up to reevaluate the pleasures that Halloween III: Season of the Witch has to offer.
0.4 There are more than enough giant logic holes, stilted characters and idiotic developments to make sure that it is bad for reasons transcending its simple poorness as a sequel
0.4 Has little connection with first two "Halloweens," including true terror.
0.5 Though the film certainly isn't awful, the filmmakers couldn't decide on their focus.
0.2 Something stinks!
0.375 This is one of those Identikit movies, assembled out of familiar parts from other, better movies.
0.6 Mr. Wallace clearly has a fondness for the cliches he is parodying and he does it with style.
0.2 Oh boy, this is a howler, justly ranked as one of the worst films in history and shocking in that it didn't kill Carpenter's career outright.
0.6 Very peculiar variant on Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Connected to the Halloween series in name only.
0.5 Points for trying something new, but the results are more laughable than terrifying.
0.9 a lot of fun for fans of the science fiction and horror genres
1.0 One hundred minutes of pure queer celebration that manages to concoct a bizarre cocktail of sincerity and reckless abandon.
0.8 It's like art-rockers Roxy Music let loose on Frankenstein - ludicrous, but oddly compelling. And it even stars Meat Loaf.
0.6 A great midnight movie experience in the theaters, but the film itself is a bit of a bore.
0.75 The film itself is a lot of fun -- but the audience-participation phenomenon has turned it into a one-of-a-kind cinematic experience.
0.6 Best seen with wild crowd at midnight. Otherwise, nope.
0.625 Viewed on video simply as a movie, without the midnight sideshow, it's cheerful and silly, and kind of sweet, and forgettable.
0.9 A very good film in its own right; it's a triumph of clever filmmaking by Jim Sharman, who should have gone on to bigger things.
0.0 I'm betting most fans have never really watched the film, they being distracted by the parade of guys in fishnets and flying toast.
0.6 Strange, unique, and one-of-a-kind... provided you see it under the right conditions.
0.875 Great music, over the top acting, extremely original. Without a doubt a one of a kind.
0.81 Love it or hate it, this is a trip you're likely never going to forget.
1.0 Oh, the horror!
0.75 a dizzying experience, made all the more so if you are lucky enough to see it in a theater with a crowd who knows all the lyrics, dance moves, and proper audience responses to yell back at the screen
0.7 ...the king of the hill of midnight movies, the undisputed champion of camp, the consummate cult classic.
0.8 For those willing to experiment with something a little bit different, a little bit outre, The Rocky Horror Picture Show has a lot to offer.
0.9 Every once in a while it's fun to just sit back, go wild, dress up in garters and watch a messed up movie.
1.0 Family entertainment at its best.
0.75 This is a zanily inventive piece of work, with delightful special effects, which set the style for a long series of live-action Disney films.
0.8 One of Disney's milestone live-action films.
0.4 Tepid live action Disney.
0.8 Goofy comedy classic.
0.8 Classic Disney, classic MacMurry.
1.0 Fun!
0.8 Enjoyable Disney effects comedy with good cast.
0.4 Disney life-action for the simple-minded.
0.8 Dated and silly, but still good family fun.
0.625 The original's simple humor looks remarkably tired compared with the story's energetic and much more inventive remake.
0.5 This 'Donnie Darko Tale' is all style, no substance - a superficial imitation that retraces the original's twists and turns but offers none of its own.
0.3 It's been reported that Richard Kelly has completely disowned this movie, and for good reason
0.4 The entire project seems to sweat from the exertion of its writer Nathan Atkins and director Chris Fisher to do something-anything-to make the film worthwhile.
0.4 It wants to echo the original but can't figure out the rhythms.
0.2 a thick, viscous sludge of cliches, stereotypes, and poorly written dialogue
0.5 If you mess with perfection, you end up with the beast.
0.66 Conventions of the time did not allow director Victor Fleming to examine the powerful sexual undertones of Stevenson's tale, robbing the film of much of its potential insight
0.75 MGM gave the familiar story the big-budget, big-star treatment, but in the process drained it of all of its biting social and psychological implications.
1.0 Quite eerie classic thriller with Tracy surprisingly good in title role(s).
0.7 Less an outright horror film than its predecessor and more a straightforward psychological study. Most of the earlier sex is replaced by a stubborn, straightlaced morality.
0.4 Botched remake of the 1931 classic.
0.4 A little Freudian theory is a dangerous thing. It can make a piece of errant hokum dizzy with significance.
0.4 Spencer Tracy is miscast and overrated in one of the weakest adaptations of the story to date.
0.8 A bit starched and yappy, but still packs a punch.
1.0 ...it renders the uttermost strengths of the silent film era, in which the audience was dependent on what went into the picture instead of what came out of the speaker.
0.875 It may not have the visual panache of the first two films, but it makes up for it with a thrilling series of events that set us up nicely for the final film in the franchise.
0.3 They didn't go full Hobbit on us, but [Mockingjay] should have been one film.
0.6 It feels like Lionsgate are killing time rather than driving forward, so hopefully the long-term success of the franchise isn't harmed by a short-term money grab.
0.625 The Hunger Games: Mockingjay is just a long, slow teaser for next year's grand finale, Mockingjay - Part 2.
0.7 That Jennifer Lawrence and her co-stars can prop up what is essentially half an epic and have us say "more please" is testament to their talents and that of director Francis Lawrence
0.75 Delivers a decent preview of the big finish coming in the final chapter.
0.375 an adaptation of a book about a teenage girl navigating the seas of her rising estral tides
0.75 It shares some structural similarities with other penultimate franchise films ... [and] by necessity, will leave you less than satisfied when the credits roll.
0.5 This half-a-novel adaptation bides its time and, in doing so, diminishes its heroine.
0.6 A solid lead-up to the finale.
0.75 As far as detached setups go, this is a movie that effectively rouses our suspicions into something of dogged interest.
1.0 This is arguably the best installment in the franchise because the love triangle is put on the back burner in favor of deeper themes.
0.63 It's a prologue without an epilogue, an introduction without a conclusion, 120 minutes of setup without a proper climax. In other words, it's a drag.
0.625 a whole lot of set-up for what we imagine will be payoff in Part 2, which doesn't necessarily make it any easier to slog through
0.75 In transforming Katniss from victim/champion to icon and expanding the stakes from personal survival to political revolution, this third film sacrifices some of the metaphorical power of its teen-centric predecessors...
0.6 Better than the first, not as good as the second.
0.625 So much of this one feels disposable in the grand scheme of things.
0.5 The film's commitment to market concerns over storytelling ones is vividly obvious throughout all of its aimless, airless minutes.
0.8 This sequel-split rests on the time-tested theory that there's money to be raked in by extending the life of characters who had us from the first arrow.
0.4 Every so often there's a sign of the old Katniss - a hint of anger, a moment of resolve - but mostly she spends the movie with a very bad case of the blahs.
0.7 The good news is that Mockingjay 1 is better than its predecessors. The bad news is that it would, I feel certain, be all but incomprehensible to anyone who hadn't seen those films.
0.7 Mockingjay is at its most powerful when it introduces a possibility that's daring in a YA franchise and would be almost unimaginable in a superhero one.
0.8 In the excitable world of dystopian fantasy, the series remains the best of the bunch.
0.4 The film is dour and lumbering, with only a handful of rousing scenes to justify the blatantly financial choice to split the novel into two films.
0.8 Top-notch casting and a well-paced slow burn make "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part One" the best film in the franchise yet...and leave us with the perfect opportunity to have our minds blown next year.
0.9 An exciting expertly paced build-up to what should be an incredible conclusion next year.
0.8 A transitional time in the life of a leader-in-the-making played beautifully by Jennifer Lawrence.
0.25 This uneventful installment basically treads water while functioning as a setup for the upcoming dramatic conclusion
0.5 Weak source material split into two films for no creative advantage only results in a disappointing artistic decision ruled by financial greed. The film anti-climatically makes us wait and leaves us asking: "For what?"
0.25 A ridiculous, bloated, stumbling Baron Harkonnen of a movie; depressing, dull and flatulent with wasted angst. It don't got no bounce.
0.5 It's an elaborate game of hurry-up-and-wait. And it's the most shameless example yet of splitting the final book in a hugely popular series into two film adaptations.
0.75 So do we blame the very existence of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part 1 on Han Solo or Harry Potter?
0.4 Dark and too often tedious.
0.6 The penultimate episode in the franchise feels like the mighty inhale that precedes a noisy, explosive sneeze. We must wait another year for release.
0.8 A spiky media satire about the making and marketing of a revolution that most definitely will be televised.
0.75 Remains entertaining, in large part because of Lawrence, but the decision to split the final chapter in two was a mistake.
0.375 Besides being padded with scenes that go on too long and drive home the same story beat that's already been established, Mockingjay - Part 1 is just plain dull. There's only one major plot revelation in the entire movie, and it's obvious from the outset.
0.8 To be honest, Mockingjay Part 1 is probably the weakest of the three so far, but if this is as bad as it gets, that is still something of a triumph.
0.8 Melancholy, violent sequel sets stage for waging war.
0.5 Just like Catching Fire, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part I is one long and boring journey leading to one surprising moment that isn't worth the two hours it takes to get to its destination.
0.7 A solid entry in the series, and lays an intriguing foundation for Part 2, but Mockingjay - Part 1 is rarely as entertaining or rewarding as its predecessors.
0.875 With Mockingjay - Part I, the series becomes a clever commentary on the genre it helped cement.
0.6 There's dramatic tension, a good deal of emotion, and one heck of a setup for the next movie. But frequently this warm-up seems like it's huffing and puffing without generating a lot of real heat.
0.75 May not work on a stand-alone level, but if you've become invested in the series, it's an important, thoughtful bridge between what has already happened and what is yet to come.
1.0 Mockingjay succeeds where the book failed
0.8 Lawrence's performance roils with stress and fear, as it did in the first two films, and director Francis Lawrence stays with her, up close, from start to finish, visually mirroring the script's examination of Katniss's cult of personality.
0.5 Dour, dreary, disappointing installment, milking every last dime out of the franchise's devoted following.
0.625 Jennifer Lawrence's charisma and the the sly excellence of her supporting cast keep "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1" aloft.
0.375 Not even the ferociously talented Jennifer Lawrence, whose greatest skill is breathing life into lifeless material, can work her magic here.
0.8 This four-part franchise, based on the Suzanne Collins novels, turns very dark with this strikingly bold third film, which once again makes the most of perspective to recount a parable about normal people rising up against oppression.
0.5 It's not as snooze worthy as the first part of "Harry Potter's" finale, but that's the only good news out of Mockingjay Part One.
0.375 ...a shameless cash-grab designed to extend the life of this profitable series.
0.8 'Mockingjay, Part 1" is only half awesome because it is only half a movie. Suzanne Collins' final book in the trilogy has been segmented into two films, massacring the momentum the previous films had delicately built.
0.7 The vast majority of credit for 'The Hunger Games' franchise should go to the cast, and most importantly to Jennifer Lawrence, without whom this sucker would surely crash and burn.
0.625 The end result is a serving of dystopian-pop entertainment lifted over the middling mark by the humanity supplied by the cast.
0.8 Mockingjay is by far the bleakest of the movies so far. Yet this first part of the last book in the Suzanne Collins series may also be the most potent.
0.8 Mockingjay - Part 1 is just big enough of a story that, even as a two-parter, the film feels substantial and justifiably halved. There's simply too much to digest as all the pieces are put into place and the real games are set to begin.
0.4 The book's critics say this the weakest of the three novels. True or not, the ultra slow Mockingjay - Part 1 is part one of a story that definitely doesn't warrant two parts.
0.7 Katniss proves she can handle the action as it spills out of the arena. Binge viewing is encouraged...
0.75 This is the "Empire Strikes Back" of the series, with the heroes constantly on defense - running, hiding, planning, hoping.
0.625 This is filler in every way you can look at it. Good filler, but still filler.
0.4 Mockingjay Part 1 is a hideously boring, bleak film. They've taken thirty minutes of plot, then stretched it out like taffy into an insufferable two hours.
0.8 This transitional effort's teething problems aside, it's crammed with well-drawn characters and intelligent ideas, meaning the franchise remains as robust and rule-breaking as its idiosyncratic protagonist.
0.5 The effect of so many Oscar-calibre actors speaking the generic dialogue is like watching pro ballplayers play T-ball.
0.75 If Mockingjay - Part 1 is quieter and less flashy than its predecessors, that doesn't make it less satisfying.
0.625 Captivating as both drama and allegory, and may even one-up the previous two entries in terms of its force of will and emotional complexity.
0.4 The greedy money grab for four movies rather than three is the epicenter of the film's problems.
0.875 Although Jennifer Lawrence hasn't earned an Oscar for her performances as Katniss Everdeen, no one can mock her 'Hunger Games' role.
0.5 It seems just one very elaborate preparation for the last episode and I do think that the fans have been conned, to a certain extent, that this episode has been split into two.
0.7 The strength of this third manifestation of The Hunger Games is in the cast and in the screenplay.
0.8 The third episode in the teen franchise is darker, deeper and braver.
0.4 As played by Hutcherson, [Peeta] has all the charisma of the least interesting member of the Yale crew team. Three movies in, [his bond with Katniss appears] more desperately theoretical than ever.
0.75 Just as the messianic rebel leader Katniss Everdeen has found her footing, the hit "Hunger Games" film series has become more assured with its latest installment.
0.75 This is as grim as PG-13 can get; the darkness is comparable to that of The Empire Strikes Back.
0.625 It's solid, though it's the least inspired of the three films to date, existing primarily as a bridge between the second film and the finale.
0.9 Skips the exhilarating games of the first two films and matures into a thought-provoking blockbuster that further distances the franchise from its would-be YA competition.
0.6 The Girl On Fire has gone up in smoke.
0.6 The Hunger Games is declining in power, but not as steeply as I thought, and this weird, operatic nightmare still inhabits the screen with confidence.
0.7 Is it worth sitting through this movie knowing full well that almost everything exciting and engaging is being saved for the finale? The answer is a qualified, with many reservations, "Yes."
0.8 It's a well-executed, occasionally daring exploration of war, propaganda, and guilt that's easy to watch, but occasionally difficult to stomach.
0.75 OK, there's less action in Games this time, but what's there is prime. And the acting is aces.
0.625 We can almost hear this revolution's resounding rallying cry: 'Hurry up and wait!'
0.6 If it's more talky and less satisfying than its predecessor, the propulsive The Hunger Games: Catching Fire - largely because the conclusion won't come until next year with Part 2 - it's still a sporadically involving adventure.
0.6 Katniss has little to do but react to the actions of others, though she does get to blow stuff up with her bow and enjoy a literal save the cat moment.
0.625 It makes for lumpy storytelling that never quite hits its stride.
0.5 The characters, once fresh and immediate creations, move like solemn chess pieces across the screen. Each scene, once tight and energized, feels sluggish and protracted. The crisp dialogue, now flabby and perfunctory, fails to propel the narrative along.
0.5 Audiences have a long year to wait for Part 2. Would it not have been better to leave them breathless than heaving a sigh?
0.625 There's enough here to at least keep fans of the series involved and eagerly awaiting the grand finale.
0.7 There's plenty of foreshadowing of what is to come but the story doesn't so much come to an end as have an intermission.
0.7 More politically-driven than its predecessors, the feature manages to keep the story's momentum going while giving more attention to its supporting characters.
0.6 Jennifer Lawrence holds everything together, ensuring by her sheer presence that you are willing to stick with it to the bitter end even as it feels that everything is in a holding position waiting for take off.
0.75 Although it doesn't make a lick of sense as a stand-alone story, "Mockingjay - Part 1" is the first "Hunger Games" movie with meat on its bones.
0.6 Although the great performances and promise of what's to come help offset the listless pacing and general needlessness of splitting the final book into two movies, the whole thing feels like one giant tease for "Part 2."
0.5 This dark-and-dour installment suffers from saga sag, which is the effort of the Hollywood studios to stretch a stirring girl power series with a monster fan-base beyond reasonable limits for the sake of lucre.
0.75 The second-to-last movie pitfalls strike, but the series has earned enough good faith to make Part 1 essential viewing.
0.625 After its first two terrific installments, the newest edition of "The Hunger Games" left me hungry, like a feast that's stunningly prepared but flavorless and non-nutritious.
0.8 Mockingjay - Part 1 is as dingy and dark as Blade Runner, but just as fascinating. No more party dresses catching fire. No more fantasy games. In their place is a war tableau that seems realistic, even if this is a futuristic fantasy film.
0.8 Although unmistakeably laying the groundwork for the finale, there is - for a series ostensibly aimed at adolescent girls - more genuine tension and bona fide thrills than Iron Man, Thor and Captain America rolled into one.
0.625 More often than not, Lawrence stands with jaw slack and brow scrunched, staring ahead to a murky future, one that won't be resolved until, oh, about this time next year.
0.4 With no real beginning and no real ending, the unsatisfying Mockingjay Part 1 is essentially all middle -- one big, stretched out, watered-down second act.
0.625 You leave this well-acted, impeccably designed movie as you entered it: still waiting.
0.6 Mockingjay may lack the action and excitement of the previous two movies, but it makes up for it in greater emotional and thematic resonance.
0.7 That Mockingjay maintains such a high level while evolving from a futuristic war film into a straight-up political thriller is an incredible achievement, even if it comes at the expense of the action some have come to expect.
0.8 DIVING back into the dystopian world of Panem and its arrow-firing heroine Katniss Everdeen continues to be a heady and exhilarating experience.
0.8 The revolution isn't just televised in the latest Hunger Games instalment; it's subdivided.
0.5 The film ultimately rests on Lawrence, and though she never disappoints, a single actress -- even one as lovely and lovable as she -- cannot save a blockbuster film.
1.0 Complexo, inteligente e tristemente contemporaneo.
0.5 Mockingjay - Part 1 does get a mid-film lift when Katniss and Gale go up against Snow's air force with a few bows and arrows; the scene is ridiculous, and it works. But the rest is a muddy, underlit slog, a movie that searches in vain for its own pulse.
0.5 Table setting for a meal that won't be served until next November.
0.625 It's a joyless, surpassingly dour enterprise, but one that fulfills its mission with Katniss's own eagle-eyed efficiency and unsentimental somberness. "Mockingjay" sets up the end Game with a grim sense of purpose.
0.625 Is there enough here to keep us interested? Yes, but there's a frustrating sense of time being marked in much of "Part 1" and the script often veers into no-duh territory.
0.7 Director Francis Lawrence does a nice job capturing the claustrophobic environment of District 13 and has a good eye for action shots. But the actors are what really sell the movie.
0.625 The least satisfying "Hunger Games" entry yet.
0.75 Lawrence, ever commanding and vulnerable, even delivers a song in a smoky voice that's vaguely reminiscent of Norah Jones. Place those EGOT 2025 bets now.
0.875 As an adaptation of part of the third book by Suzanne Collins, it's easily the most political of the three films. It's also the most absorbing and best in the series.
0.25 A dull, claustrophobic, pallid-looking film about people looking into and talking at screens. When the end finally comes, it's from out of nowhere, except it's not really an ending, more like a work stoppage.
0.2 For a film about the power of media to sway humanity in a desired direction, it's awfully leaden.
0.75 A dark, grim and exciting entertainment.
0.7 Without giving anything away, let's just say the pause button has been pressed with tantalising precision. Same time next year, then? You bet.
0.5 In this chapter, Katniss Everdeen, the working-class rebel played by Jennifer Lawrence, mostly holsters her weapons and plays dress-up, just as the movie itself gives up any higher aspirations of offering social commentary or insight.
0.75 Even though Mockingjay contains scenes of mass graves and mass slaughter on the battlefield, this isn't a movie, or a set of characters, built on bloodlust or the enjoyment of anonymous kills.
0.8 Yes, there is the usual teacup storm of romance, a girl caught between two boys, as in the Twilight series, but The Hunger Games offers teenagers a much more important set of questions to ponder.
0.4 Nothing more than a prelude to next year's finale. The material is way too thin to sustain two movies.
0.625 We're meant to feel the weight of Katniss' situation, and we do, but the picture can also fairly be called leaden...
0.75 I took my 14-year-old niece to see it, and she emphatically expressed "Oh my God! It was amazing!" You can't beat that.
0.375 Thinly spreads a half-hour's worth of plot over two plodding hours.
0.5 If you want drama, and action - and, most especially, Katniss in charge - well, buy another ticket, next year.
0.4 There are moments when "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1" takes flight, but overall this action-drama flits about, wondering where to land.
0.5 Dull, dark and relentlessly glum.
0.7 The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 often plays like a waiting game, but it solidifies the star and ideas of the franchise as the true heroes behind the YA phenomenon.
0.6 What was a tamed rip-off of the gory 'Battle Royale' becomes more like Steven Soderbergh's 'Che': a cerebral look at the gruntwork of revolution - with the YA-required threeway love story, of course.
0.625 What do you get when you greedily split a book in two? Long-winded filler with only pockets of tense action. Or, in Hunger Games terms: all smoke, no Girl on Fire.
0.8 Mockingjay merits the split - it perhaps even gives some balance and rhythm to a story that might've felt rushed were the events crammed into a single movie.
0.6 A disappointing follow-up to 'Catching Fire.' You're left feeling as if you've only watched half a movie without the same feeling of anticipation to see what happens next.
0.85 It's the blockbuster reimagined for a modern age of social consciousness, in which having the right idea means nothing if you can't also make a meme out of it.
0.8 The power of emotions in filmmaking is at the heart of this beautifully constructed and self-aware blockbuster. Can't wait for Mockingjay 2.
0.6 It might make economic sense for Lionsgate Pictures to carve the novel in two but it means this movie is all built-up with a distinct lack of excitement.
0.6 I wait with almost-bated breath for part two, a year from now. But I wish I didn't have to.
0.8 The politics of Mockingjay are as intensely gripping as the games in the earlier films -- and more deadly.
0.6 The drama and tone are powerful and effective and Lawrence makes an exceptionally charismatic heroine, but an almost total lack of action means this is less catching fire than treading water.
0.8 The film-makers have kept Collins's best lines, allowing Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson, as Katniss's two love rivals, to show off their genuine acting skills.
0.6 Lawrence is again tremendous as Katniss. She gives her character an emotional depth that you don't expect in a franchise movie, conveying her vulnerability and doubt as well as well as her fiery determination and Barbarella-like sex appeal.
0.8 Mockingjay is, of course, fundamentally meant to be an engaging piece of entertainment... However, it's also a story in which the protagonist can be looked at as not just an unlikely hero, but a deconstruction of what a hero is or is meant to be.
0.8 Finds its success in meaningful themes, character-driven story, and smart execution, and ultimately creates some impressive depth for the phenomenon franchise.
0.8 Thrilling, heartfelt, and a terrific curtain-raiser for the final battle, Mockingjay Part 1 takes the Hunger Games series to new heights even as it sings in its own voice.
0.6 The special effects are limp and the script a little creaky, although somehow it still manages to thrill.
0.8 With measure and muscle, Lawrences Jennifer and Francis nail the job of selling the long, twisting road towards revolution.
0.6 As terrific as that first act is and as mostly entertaining as what follows is, Hunger Games: Catching Fire part I is half of a single story and mostly concerned with setting up however the series ends.
0.6 All queue, no roller-coaster.
0.8 Stylish, gripping and surprisingly thoughtful.
0.8 The Empire Strikes Back of the Hunger Games series.
0.8 Mockingjay Part 1 is a powerful, moving, penultimate chapter.
0.4 Convoluted and rather dull.
0.8 Definitely worth a look for fans of the involved directors, though such fans probably already own it.
0.8 Intriguing and mostly successful.
0.75 If the other two stories had also been done by Fellini, the whole offering might have been much better.
0.6 [Toby Dammit] is marvelous: a short movie but a major one. The Vadim is as overdecorated and shrill as a drag ball, but still quite fun, and the Malle, based on one of Poe's best stories, is simply tedious.
0.6 Horrific? Not really. But interesting to watch.
0.6 See it for Fellini's hilarious "Toby Dammit" sequence. (Elsewhere Jane and Peter Fonda play lovers...)
0.6 The Fellini part is brilliant. The rest is not.
0.67 While Spirits of the Dead doesn't do much justice to Poe's source material, fans of bizarre French cinema should have a pretty good time.
0.875 As far as psychological horror goes, the films work well, and that they realize Poe's stories were mainly internalized distortions of the world works to their advantage, even as they approach the material in vastly different ways.
0.75 more of an interesting exercise in literary adaptation than a fully satisfying work of art
0.7 Not what I would have expected... but hey, we are defined by our contradictions, no?
0.6 The Vicious Brothers have some fun with what's essentially a slasher movie featuring homicidal aliens.
0.2 There's nothing at all original, engaging, stimulating or thought-provoking (for all of these, see Invasion of the Body Snatchers) within its frames.
0.45 If the whole premise of Extraterrestrial sounds familiar, that's because there's hardly an original idea in the whole film.
0.4 Everything about it is meant to either raise or lower your expectations.
0.625 "Extraterrestrial" never settles into a groove, and therefore never becomes more than a collection of effectively icky scenes.
0.2 If aliens travel thousands of light-years to terrorize you, the least you can do is put them in an exciting movie.
0.25 I kept holding out hope it would reveal itself as a parody in the 11th hour.
0.4 A hackneyed, seen-it-all-before tale that has grown somewhat tired in contemporary cinema.
0.6 Once Extraterrestrial gets gruesome and starts delivering the mayhem, there's certainly some fun to be found here.
0.2 Extra-terrible, more like.
0.6 An enjoyably cheesy B-movie containing some unexpected twists and a good few laughs, intentional and otherwise.
0.7 A riotous hybrid of alien mayhem and cabin-in-the-woods horror, this movie has a playful tone that makes it thoroughly entertaining.
0.4 Minihan and Ortiz trundle out the same old storyline: creepy things in the woods, camcorder found footage - and abductions by aliens who prove that everything you've heard about their anatomical-exploratory procedures is 100% correct.
0.4 A blunt picture where everything feels borrowed from earlier, better films.
0.4 This all-too-familiar assemblage of dumbed-down flotsam and campy jetsam from far-better sci-fi films is filled with cliched predictability.
0.6 The exact midway point between Steven Spielberg and Ed Wood, this a cheerily obvious schlocker that will please B-movie purists.
0.4 When the lead actress is introduced with a leering close-up of her scantily clad backside, it's safe to say that character development was never a top priority.
0.8 Minihan's direction is assured and slick and it's nice to see some oldschool aliens rock up on screen.
0.4 Revelling in its B-movie conventions to little dramatic effect, this intergalactic slasher is often unintentionally hilarious.
0.7 Extraterrestrial harkens back to a time when sci-fi movies could be both fun and horrific, finding success thanks to the Vicious Brothers' "no holds barred" filmmaking mentality.
0.5 [It doesn't] further the alien sub-genre, which as far as I'm concerned, is dead.
0.4 A variety of modest but well-executed special effects enlivens the otherwise run-of-the-mill effort about carnivorous aliens terrorizing a farm. The farm wins.
0.6 Black balls that kill... what more can be said?
0.6 "Gremlins on Acid" - as wacky as it is wicked, loads of fun
0.75 a fun "gremling-inspired" movie
0.6 Not a bad little Gremlins' rip-off.
0.8 Entirely enjoyable B-level sci-fi throwback.
0.3 This is just another 3D cash grab by George Lucas. If you didn't like the film before, you won't like the film now.
0.7 The Force may not be strong in this episode, but it's there.
0.5 Anyone hoping the 3D would make-up for the film's many shortcomings, will probably continue to feel cheated by the first Star Wars prequel.
0.375 We don't want to remember it's pretty bad. Then we do.
0.1 Has a film director ever induced such terrible performances from such great actors? Liam Neeson - wooden, Ewan McGregor - monotone and the Oscar winning Natalie Portman - a speaking alarm clock!
0.6 It hardly needs to be said that the 3D conversion here is nothing more than proficient, that it adds nothing and actually takes away some of the clarity and vividness of the film's varied colour palette.
0.75 It's a nifty enough film that's entertaining but not comparable to the original 'Star Wars.'
0.3 The Phantom Menace is, at best and worst, a mediocre film-a boring adventure undermined by anemic political theatrics and the rusty artistic tastes of its maker.
0.8 The 3D conversion on this film is one of the best I've ever seen... and that's what makes it worth paying some extra money to see it again in the theater.
0.375 "Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace" got dismissive reviews in 1999, and it deserves the same today. But you probably know that.
0.5 You realize how much humor Harrison Ford brought to things; without him, at times the movie itself feels frozen in Carbonite.
0.45 The Phantom Menace, in any number of dimensions, is an exercise in disappointment, a film filled with enough callbacks to the first trilogy to remind you about what you loved about them without adding much of note in all the new material.
0.5 You may never experience this or any Star Wars movie as a cinematic experience ever again. Especially not in theater.
0.4 A pop-culture calamity, a soulless, passionless film whose only real effect was to smudge the happy memories of the three originals.
0.4 For the most part, the sludgy re-processing of the original leaves everything looking as if it was lensed through a wet, worn sock. Only one sequence -- the epic pod race on the planet Tatooine -- goes close to making any worthwhile use of the 3D format
0.4 The only plus point is introducing newbies to the big-screen Star Wars experience - if the 3D price is right for you.
0.6 Still unsure of the basic mechanics of the plot, drags in places and that Binks chap wasn't just a bad dream, but when it soars, it soars.
0.4 The added visual depth does little to disguise quite how flat everything in between is.
0.0 It's difficult to discern precisely where this all went wrong, and even more difficult to speculate about possible improvements.
0.4 Kid-centric but violent prequel lacks energy of originals.
0.4 The visuals are indeed eye-popping, but I was left with no vested emotional tie to either story or characters.
0.625 It's still a galaxy far, far away, and it still looks like nothing we've ever seen before.
0.75 It's good to have Star Wars -- any Star Wars -- back after such a long time; and it's worth seeing.
0.8 What's important to remember is that the better moments don't merely balance out the weaker ones - they topple them.
0.75 No film made could measure up to the avalanche of buzz and craziness surrounding this release. There is plenty of both good and bad news here.
0.9 I enjoyed the film and feel that it established the foundation for many story elements that were curiously unexplained in the previous trilogy.
0.25 As an artist, Lucas is lacking, but as a businessman he knows his stuff.
0.75 Lucas' films might not be very deep, but they're very complex and involving in a comic book kind of way.
0.6 Se este fosse o primeiro episodio da serie a chegar aos cinemas, ela nao teria alcancado o status e a longevidade que conseguiu nos ultimos 20 anos.
0.8 It exactly has the same strengths and weaknesses as the original three, plus breathtakingly spectacular visual design and special effects.
0.8 Episodio I tuvo la virtud de juntar a dos generaciones en un mismo fenomeno
0.625 It does the job just fine. That job, as director George Lucas freely admits, is quite simply to thrill the beating hearts and the inquiring minds of 12-year-old boys.
0.8 It's not perfect ... but it's still fantastic.
0.6 ...not in the same league as the original Star Wars. But, then, it was never meant to be.
0.8 An often deliriously exciting adventure, hitting the target audience of 10-year olds and satisfying long-time fans.
0.875 The visual imagery comes off the screen in leaps and bounds, and it allows Lucas the freedom to construct intricately detailed action sequences that put the audience right in the action.
0.8 It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and offers a swashbuckling extragalactic getaway, creating illusions that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of Jurassic Park.
0.875 A testimony to how far special effects have come.
0.5 Though I've been bored senseless by the Star Wars phenomenon for over two decades, I found The Phantom Menace something of a pleasant surprise.
0.875 There is a sense of discovery in scene after scene of The Phantom Menace.
0.8 A great work from a greater director, and a blockbuster of quite the most swashbuckling kind.
0.625 Quite uninteresting in its stale moments, the "Menace" soars from time to time.
0.875 The story was well told, the characters were for the most part nicely drawn, and the action was phenomenal.
0.6 I wish Phantom Menace was a better film. The bones of a great film are there. But there's no beating the sense of hope and adventure and honest-to-goodness wonder that shines through.
0.79 The special effects are as awesome as you would expect, and this is an extremely slick production.
0.8 Spectacular fun!
0.75 Lucas has gotten rusty, and it shows in quite a few places. But he still has the heart of a visionary, and when that shines through, The Phantom Menace is a wonder to behold.
0.75 This entry into the Star Wars saga does the originals justice in terms of heart, action, and fun.
0.875 This is a film made for the fans. On that level, it doesn't disappoint.
0.6 Like a giant anchor in a sea of scattered Hollywood myths, Phantom Menace --the mere making of it -- promises viewers a point of reference of biblical proportions.
0.75 An old-fashioned epic and like epics of yore it supplies its audiences with enough spectacle and awe.
1.0 Visually dazzling, inventive beyond imagining and full of resonant detail that recalls stories told or hints at those to come!
0.75 Lucas has proved he has the Naboos to pull it off again.
0.7 [Lucas] ought to spend more time on story and less time crunching binaries.
0.8 It's an extremely enjoyable movie, blending imagination with technology and creating visual eye candy, wrapped up in a lightweight but enjoyable story.
0.7 Finally someone has crossed the line where reality and fantasy are indistinguishable!
0.875 The Phantom Menace takes twists and turns you don't expect.
0.7 I'd have to say it's a better picture than Return of the Jedi while falling into the same third-act trap of juxtaposing a terrific swordfight with boring, slapstick scenes of combat.
0.875 Only time will tell if this movie deserves to be connected to the last three episodes, or, for that matter, if the final three episodes deserve to be connected to this one.
0.8 This movie is a perfect example of why the word 'eye-candy' was invented.
0.875 Perfecto ejemplo de como la imaginacion puede traspasar fronteras y edades
0.7 A feast for the eyes and ears!
0.8 This Star Wars engages by its sheer variety of characters!
0.75 Thoroughly entertaining!
0.75 Exceptionally well-made, highly imaginative.
0.8 There's plenty to look at!
0.75 It isn't the best in the series, but it delivers about what you would expect.
0.9 Decide for yourself.
0.7 A film that not only couldn't stand up to the hype monster, but also couldn't stand up to multiple viewings.
1.0 Not only is it a fanciful phenomenon but it's also the most eye-popping spectacular special-effects picture ever made as George Lucas integrates the fantasy of computer imagery with reality.
0.875 Not a great film, but it is magical and majestic.
0.625 Flawed as it is, The Phantom Menace captured my imagination and I enjoyed it.
0.875 It works as an action flick, visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting; it also works as an elicitor of memories, a piece of exquisite nostalgia.
0.625 It's a frenetic visual feast indeed; there's nothing quite like it in the galaxy.
0.4 Joyless, overly reverential and impenetrably plotted!
0.5 It's wholesome and enjoyable entertainment for kids, rather than the slap in the face a truly bad movie would have been, but the fans deserve more.
0.5 Wait till it's out on video. Then borrow it.
0.3 It is an understatement to say that the movie is a disappointment; it is the disappointment of the millennium.
0.4 If I had to pick six words to describe this movie, they would be, 'too busy, too silly, no mystery.'
0.625 With Phantom, Lucas has brought the series to the brink of total artificiality, the future as a video game.
0.5 Geared more to video-game fans than to grown-up moviegoers who remember when the best fantasy films had grander ambitions.
0.5 Lucas' directorial attention is clearly not focused on the cast, most of whom seem slightly adrift.
0.5 Everything about this film is so mechanical you wonder if it was written, directed and acted by 'droids.'
0.625 What's missing from George Lucas' heralded return to the screen is . . . sex.
0.5 In special effects, Lucas has moved a galaxy beyond. In energy, not yet.
0.625 It actually undoes some of the myth and magic that the first three movies forged in the hearts and minds of millions of movie lovers.
0.5 Even without the pre-release hoopla, The Phantom Menace would be a considerable letdown!
0.625 Still, you have to see it, don't you? I know I did, and I'm glad I did. But I can honestly say I was never really entertained.
0.5 The result is an adventure that feels...well, Forced.
0.8 Sit back and enjoy fantastic, imaginative visuals.
0.5 It starts off briskly with some fantastic special effects and a great high-speed chase but then founders on the shores of bad script writing.
0.7 Lucas does not always recognize his limitations. This tends to make films of mixed quality. Still, there is always enough that is excellent to make them worth seeing.
0.75 It is certainly better than the childish Phantom Menace and the final 45 minutes of straight action beat the editing nightmare at the end of the last film.
0.8 The magic has definitely been recaptured.
0.8 As convincing a job as they, Christensen, and Lee do, they all end up being upstaged by the jaw-dropping skills of a CGI creation: Yoda (again voiced by Frank Oz), who finally gets a chance to show exactly why he has such a legendary reputation.
0.875 It's impossible...to dismiss a film with this much stuff: exotic production design, imaginative characters, and a wide variety of digital jedi fu.
0.6 It would be easy to say that this film is fantastic and blows away the others, but unfortunately I cannot.
0.75 Superior to Episode I -- The Phantom Menace, with its annoying Jar Jar Binks and its dull, galaxy-hopping story line.
0.75 Alternately excites and bores.
0.5 I'll call it nearly good, based mostly on one hell of a last half-hour.
0.8 It's no Empire Strikes Back but then you won't have to worry about Jar Jar too much either.
0.2 How I wish I could say something other than ho-hum.
0.6 You will most likely end up sitting through this latest installment - even if the series has become a shadow of its former self
0.9 My God, how wonderful it would be if it just even pretended to not be so commercialized.
0.875 The Star Wars franchise continues to slip into obscurity with another underwhelming entry.
0.6 At least it's better than Return of the Jedi. If that sounds like faint praise... then line up and find out for yourself.
0.6 I feel ambivalent about it and I'm still going to pay to see it again. It's just that important to our collective dorkitude.
0.9 The film has that Star Wars atmosphere fully in place, complete with a thematic resonance and a reliance on strong personalities interacting to drive the events forward.
0.4 Yes, it's better than The Phantom Menace. Think for a minute about how little that means.
0.8 Star Wars fans, prepare to weep with joy.
0.75 It has all the moves; it never quite catches the rhythm.
0.6 ...open your eyes and ears and disengage your mind...it's a splendid film, and enjoying it for its sheer beauty is much more fun than having to think about it.
0.75 If Phantom Menace resulted in mindless boredom, then Attack of the Clones at least offers mindless entertainment.
0.2 A tale full of sound and fury, sucking the life out of cinema.
0.875 The least of the Star Wars series, but that is pretty damn good.
0.75 Star Wars fans will be in heaven.
0.875 Es divertida, visualmente espectacular y muy entretenida. Simple y sencillamente te sorprendera.
0.875 Lucas returns the series to its roots, delivering a cartoon-like adventure that uses special effects to enhance rather than replace storytelling.
0.9 Meant for Star Wars fans. It is there to give them a good time.
0.8 Se Obi-Wan e Yoda continuarem a brilhar desta forma, duvido que o Imperio dos Pessimistas consiga derrubar o trabalho do Mestre Lucas.
0.6 It's still got enough magic to coast on sheer goodwill.
0.5 The battling Yoda looks ludicrous, like Kermit the Frog in a Matrix fight scene.
0.875 less Jar Jar, no discussion of taxes and trade blockades, and more Jedis, violence, and sex appeal
0.6 Lucas has never been able to conjure another Han Solo, a character who could, with simply a wink, remind us that this was just an overgrown Saturday afternoon serial.
0.875 In the end, what I appreciated most was the unpredictability of it all.
0.75 Clones largely brings everything together, deepening the arc of the entire story ... and restoring the mythological grandeur that helped establish the series in the first place.
0.625 What Lucas needs to wrap up this franchise properly is a return to the fundamentals: less overplotted hooey, more thick blue liquid.
0.8 Attack of the Clones is light years ahead of its predecessor and a return to the fun Saturday matinee feel that the original films possessed. There's a bunch of surprises, and a good mix of action, laughs, romance, and suspense.
0.7 If you ignore the cheesy dialog and the political mumbo-jumbo, the power of the force has returned to the franchise.
0.4 Two hours of nonsense and fifteen minutes that may sell a couple more bags of Yoda-endorsed Sour Cream and Onion Ruffles.
0.5 Why does Lucas even bother planting the seeds if he refuses to let them sprout?
0.7 It's an ambitious film, and as with all ambitious films, it has some problems. But on the whole, you're gonna like this movie.
0.9 Just watching the little fuzzy guy doing stuff that would put Cirque du Soleil to shame was a blast in and of itself.
0.3 A riot of sterility, with planetscape after stunning planetscape swallowing up its characters and their petty concerns.
0.6 Attack of the mildly engaging plot.
0.75 Abounds in A-budget variations of Saturday-matinee B-movie excitement.
0.5 Isn't it sad that these movies no longer sweep us away, but force us to sit making mental checklists of what George Lucas has done right and what he has done wrong?
1.0 As one of the millions of so-called fan-geeks out there, Episode II was all I hoped it would be.
1.0 "Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones" is the most stunningly beautiful, visually dazzling and fiercely action-packed of all the "Star Wars" films.
0.4 Well, it's better than The Phantom Menace. But George Lucas' latest chapter suffers from onerous self-importance.
0.8 The dialogue is so wooden that you can use it for batting practice...Just sit back and let your eyes feast on the wonderfully imaginative visuals.
0.875 The diverging plot lines and the rich, expansive and incredibly beautiful scenery and planets -- not to mention the constant action -- almost make up for Lucas' deficiency with the spoken word.
0.875 There's an amazing gladiator-like confrontation in a coliseum followed by a rip-roaring battle scene between the Jedi warriors and the army of clones.
0.4 Attack of the Clones, while rallying in its final third, is as talky and long-winded as the bickering Jedi Council.
0.5 THX Digital sound and some great visual fury...signifying nothing.
1.0 By far the best movie to be released so far in 2002.
0.4 The script is weak, the dialogue is flat, the acting is stiff, and most of all, the all-important love story that's supposed to give the film its emotional core just doesn't work.
0.6 The film is not as bad as the mainstream critics are making it out to be. Unfortunately, it's not as good as the hardcore fan critics are saying, either.
0.74 Despite some weaknesses, Attack of the Clones redeems the franchise.
0.8 Now THIS is a Star Wars movie. Attack of the Clones has much more rooted into the Star Wars universe as we know it.
0.875 This is a special effects extravaganza.
0.75 Beautifully majestic...often awe-inspiring...five times better than Episode I.
0.875 Fans have a fix, audiences have an adventure, and Lucas has another blockbuster; what's not to love?
0.75 You might check your watch a couple of times during the long, long set-up, but that last act will have you riveted to your seat!
0.8 It's just fun, pure and simple.
0.625 May qualify as the third-best episode yet -- behind The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars.
0.5 An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots.
0.7 I'm all over the action in the movie, and the last half hour alone is literally worth the price of admission.
0.6 A solid summer movie worth its admission price.
0.6 A better movie than the clumsy Phantom Menace.
0.9 Back are the old-fashioned movie-serial thrills, breathtaking action sequences, elaborate mythology and vivid imagination that made his original Star Wars trilogy such a success back in the 1970s and '80s.
0.625 This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own.
0.5 With Clones, it is abundantly clear that the Force just isn't with [Lucas] any longer.
0.625 The old charm is mostly left behind, a twinkle in Princess Leia's eyes, while Lucas clones films with industrial fervor.
0.5 Unlike the first Star Wars, made for a general audience in search of a good time, Attack of the Clones is pitched to a cult audience.
0.375 Watching Attack of the Clones is like getting rapped on the head with a rubber mallet -- no lasting damage (I pray and hope), but bad enough to bring on an acute bout of dizziness and disorientation.
0.5 Yes, Episode II is beautifully rendered and better than the last. It's also duller than Tatooine's desert landscape until the last half-hour.
0.6 Takes itself on a dazzling, digital tear.
0.5 To borrow from Yoda-speak: Much to desire we still have.
0.625 By going forward into the past to create a 'prequel' trilogy, Lucas has trapped himself in a fundamentally anticlimactic venture.
0.875 Lucas trumps himself with the coolest lightsaber fight since the first Luke-vs.-Vader face-off in The Empire Strikes Back.
0.625 A cosmic letdown to watch this new film and realize that Lucas still doesn't know how to write dialogue or direct flesh- and-blood actors and, even more significantly, has largely forgotten how to evoke wonder and have a little fun.
0.625 Instead of zesty and daring, Attack of the Clones is often labored and stiff.
0.6 This didn't feel like Star Wars. It felt like a movie ripping off Star Wars. Something wasn't right.
0.75 Christensen succeeds because he reveals the flashes of evil within Anakin's character: a word, a gesture, a youthful burst of impatience.
0.25 This is a fantasy with no poetry in it, which explains why barely a frame of it stuck with me after I left the theater.
1.0 Lucas has recaptured and accentuated the elements that made the original films such a joy to experience.
0.5 While it was always clear that Lucas cared more about special effects than acting, here his lack of interest has produced phenomenally wooden performances from newcomers and veterans alike.
0.6 Just entertaining enough to warrant a bit more than a passing grade, the film is better than Menace, but not by a great deal and still has too many glaring problems to make it as good or just plain enjoyable as it could and should have been.
1.0 Bristles with excitement in every frame making this installment a high-energy adventure.
0.9 Simply put, the 'good stuff' in Attack of the Clones so outweighs the bad...that the bad is hardly worth mentioning.
0.375 The emphasis on computer-generated effects ultimately robs the movie of much of its energy.
0.5 Clones is more star chores than Star Wars.
0.75 Episode II is certainly flawed, but Lucas gets enough things right to give even disillusioned Star Wars fans new hope for Episode III.
0.6 [T]here's nothing new to the picture, no creative chance taken.
0.875 No screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of Clones' last 45 minutes.
0.9 This is not another Phantom Menace franchise; it's a phenomenal, eye-popping feast for the senses.
0.75 Is it as good as the original trilogy? No. But, as we move closer to understanding how these people become those people, it's clear that Lucas' storytelling powers are gathering force.
0.625 It's better than The Phantom Menace. But unless you're an absolute raving Star Wars junkie, it isn't much fun.
0.8 The computer generated sets may amaze, and computer-generated characters blend seamlessly with live actors. But it is the return of the humans that makes Clones work.
0.75 Attack of the Clones is a triumph of technology over humanity, and if it falls short of a completely fulfilling experience, it also achieves the kind of primal emotion movies were invented for: wonder.
0.75 It may not be a perfect film, but Attack of the Clones is close to what we've come to expect from a Star Wars movie.
0.75 The film isn't without flaws -- acting is wooden early on, at least one action scene could be cut and certain computer effects look phony. But it's worthy of this compliment: Clones is a real Star Wars movie.
0.625 If you're not a long-standing admirer there's little reason to join the queues on opening night.
1.0 Consistently thrilling and massively enjoyable, Clones redeems Lucas' reputation after Menace.
0.7 The persistent shadow of Darth Vader is the most interesting aspect in a movie that fails to live up to its potential.
0.5 For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects, the new Star Wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one.
1.0 This movie should thoroughly please old fans and even create new ones, even if it probably won't win over critics who believe the series has turned into the movie equivalent of a slick, vacuous theme park.
0.6 A gloriously fun last 30 minutes isn't enough to hide a preceding two hours of bland entertainment
0.75 Dozens of moments catch you up and take your breath away.
0.875 In a time when, more often than not, sequels disappoint, it's refreshing to uncover something this high-profile that fulfils the promise of its name and adds another title to a storied legacy.
0.625 This thing will have your mind glazed over faster than a glob of dough in a Krispy Kreme plant.
0.5 Much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie.
0.4 Lucas' gift for animating the inanimate turns out to be paralleled by a tendency to deaden what should be completely alive.
0.7 A vast improvement on the last episode in the Star Wars franchise, The Phantom Menace.
0.875 On a purely visceral level, Clones is a delightfully rousing, eye-popping, crowd-pleasing homage to Saturday-morning serials of the '30s and '40s.
0.7 Exalts the character of former Queen, now Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), whose impressive array of attractive costumes appropriate the young actress' natural beauty.
0.875 While the first Star Wars will always be a sentimental favorite, Attack of the Clones may well be the best in the series overall.
0.875 Lucas' slickest trick is how by the end--in spite of any snickers or groans one may have uttered along the way--one finds oneself invested in the fates of these characters.
0.8 Christensen shines at the centre.
0.5 Millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry.
0.5 The Force against dullness is finally goosing George Lucas.
0.7 Altogether, the movie is enjoyable despite its nagging script inadequacies and crummy 'down' scenes.
0.7 It's worth the price of a ticket. You're going to see the damn thing anyway, have a clear conscience.
1.0 Funny, complex and enormous fun.
0.5 Episode II-- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight.
1.0 Do we really have to wait another three years?
1.0 Wonder, hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along, especially if it begins with the name of Star Wars
0.125 Its screenplay serves as auto-critique, and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure.
0.2 I'm tempted to quote an evergreen Public Enemy song: don't believe the hype.
0.75 It's all about Anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and, of course, special effect.
0.75 ...as the story congeals you feel the pieces of the Star Wars saga falling into place in a way that makes your spine tingle with revelation and excitement.
0.8 In the end, Clones bests Menace on most levels... acting, story, effects, score.
0.8 Star Wars fans should be entertained and general audiences should get a kick out of it too.
0.8 An action-packed, fun-filled adventure.
0.7 Nothing more than a decent action flick with great effects and a silly story that happens to be blessed by a very good pedigree.
0.75 Move over Spidey, George Lucas is bringing out a sci-fi movie with a little more gravitas to knock you off your perch.
0.5 Here's the good news: the latest toy from George Lucas's soulless Star Wars factory is better than The Phantom Menace. Now the bad: it's not much better.
0.8 Impeccable visuals, intriguing characters, awesome action sequences, a surprising romance and a generally more "adult" feel..
0.9 Everything I wanted in a Matrix sequel
0.4 Not one of the worst sequels that has ever been put in movie theaters, and not one of the most disappointing... but, is it ever a grind.
0.8 Electrifying but still violent 2nd in trilogy.
0.625 The encoded bloom is off the digital rose in The Matrix Reloaded. [Blu-ray]
0.75 Offers some phenomenal action sequences that more than deliver on the jaw-dropping promise shown on the trailers.
0.6 Between the money scenes, we get characters standing at attention and burping prophecies and deep thoughts at each other.
0.75 ...less a narrative than an advertisement for a cultural wave. It's all about discount Zen and black clothes, the commodification of sterile violence as Kabuki.
0.625 As a movie, its pacing is off, its characters are thin and its plot is...well, questionable at best. But as a science-fiction phenomenon, it is art.
0.8 The Matrix Reloaded -- not unlike its predecessor -- might be hard to swallow, but it's so delicious you just can't help but want more.
1.0 Now if I can just make it until November to see how those loose ends tie up...
0.2 Tremendously bad.
0.625 Entertaining enough to make it worth the price of a movie ticket.
0.9 Trying to describe it is futile. Just go see it.
0.5 'What made the first film so satisfying -- the detailed creepiness of human enslavement by technology -- is barely touched on here.'
0.8 I can't wait to see what the Wachowski's have in store.
0.7 Sure to entertain, philosophize, and leave you hanging for the final chapter.
0.75 Reloaded can't match the initial thrill sensation in the first. What it does do is expound on the original with considerable style and move the story forward.
0.875 ... It is a satisfying continuation of the epic story begun in The Matrix and sets the stage for what should be a grand finale...
0.8 [D]azzling special effects, lots of action, and some mind bending philosophizing.
0.875 In an attempt to turn The Matrix into a state-of-the-art trilogy, The Wachowski Bros. have posed new questions that viewers hope will be answered in the final chapter.
0.6 Don't even try to figure any of it out. Just look, listen, and enjoy.
0.8 .
0.6 The Matrix franchise, founded on a stylish sense of cool, has suddenly reinvented itself in the nerdy image of Star Wars.
0.8 A smart and entertaining film that, if it doesn't work the same magic as its predecessor, still makes us believe in the power of choice to change the world.
0.5 Maybe it's way-too-high expectations and sequel lowliness to X2 but The Matrix Reloaded -- with all those lame Superman flights -- is an unthreatening misfire compared to the first
0.8 ...impressed the hell out of me?and that?s coming from a critic who?s very hard to please.
0.7 While The Matrix Reloaded certainly held my attention, it doesn't have my heart.
0.666666666667 The technical talent is there: the problem is the script, which never once pauses to consider its own essential silliness.
1.0 There are levels on which it works, and levels on which it doesn't, but all of them hold our attention.
0.625 'Simplemente es una mediana cinta de accion que quiza encuentre su lugar cuando llegue la parte final de la historia.'
0.5 Andy and Larry Wachowski's eagerly awaited sequel comprises equal parts style and stupidity.
0.875 The Matrix Reloaded is the same genius material, only this time with a small handful of flaws.
0.2 We hear so much that Neo is "The One" the "Oracle" spoke of in "The Prophecy" that I began to think his midiclorines predisposed him to The Force.
0.8 An unqualified triumph for the many artisans who brought to life some of the most audacious and astonishing action sequences you are likely to see for a decade.
0.5 It highlighted the main problem with the first film and exacerbated it: the Wachowskis are not profound, although they want to be.
0.8 Caso continue a caminhar na direcao sugerida por esta segunda parte, Matrix Revolutions confirmara o potencial desta trilogia em se firmar como um dos projetos mais ambiciosos de ficcao cientifica que o Cinema ja produziu.
0.8 It all adds up to 138 minutes of very high-quality entertainment: and it's not often the time whizzes by as entertainingly as this.
0.625 For all its technological brilliance, the brothers' script undercuts the illusion, as the dialogue sounds as if it should be delivered comic book-style, in balloons over the actors' heads.
0.4 Bloated, pretentious, confusing and occasionally downright annoying.
0.75 The questions raised by the film about the nature of reality and the extent of control available to those who can manipulate it are truly frightening if you give them enough thought, which is what makes this film and its predecessor surprisingly unique.
1.0 To simply say the "Matrix Reloaded" is better than the first is too easy.
0.8 I hope it's intentionally funny, especially the Busby Berkeley fight with Weaving, who I wished would don one of his Priscilla costumes and start lip-synching Abba.
0.5 The low point occurs when the unwashed masses of Zion celebrate Neo's return with what appears to be the previously unknown Dirty Dancing rave sequence from 'One Million Years B.C.'
0.9 Cool, smart fun that lives up to its predecessor, with only a couple of slow spots.
0.7 . I watched The Matrix to freshen up on all that coolness the night before seeing Reloaded. I would still watch it again over this. .
0.7 Highly pretentious and overly serious yet a feast for the eyes with groundbreaking effects and action sequences.
0.5 There's only so much Rubik's Cubism a film can handle, and Reloaded is awash in sci-fi and religious overtones that continually bog down the film's forward motion.
1.0 The film is so intellectually complex, so stimulating, that multiple viewings are required -- perhaps a calculated move on the Wachowskis' part for one of the most anticipated films of the year, if not the era.
0.8 I'm pleased to report [the Brothers Wachowski] pulled it off. And the testicular fortitude required to pull off the film I've just seen boggles the mind.
0.2 The Matrix Reloaded makes the deathly mistake of believing that it's hype is actually mythology and buys into this whole-heartedly. The result is a dull, slow-moving piece of pretention.
0.5 Instead of developing a story that you can get involved in, the filmmakers simply obsess over the minutia of their own creation.
0.7 A film that escalates its ability to astonish viewers with its technological achievements.
0.5 Viewing The Matrix Reloaded is like being eaten alive slowly by a machine. Some machine parts are impressive and you can slip into a sort of trance as you are noshed.
0.75 Early in the movie, Morpheus warns a new character that he's got to have faith. All things considered, The Matrix Reloaded justifies that faith.
0.5 The plot is interesting and there is almost enough to make a fascinating 20 minute short. Unfortunately, the film is well over two hours.
0.6 There are a lot of images we are seeing on the screen for the first time, some quite impressive.
0.625 Hopefully November's release of 'Revolutions' will reveal a clarity of purpose and a satisfying end to the saga. In mid-May, I can only go by what I see on the screen. And it's a muddled, overreaching, occasionally engrossing mess.
0.6 Smart, sexy, and action-rammed.
0.8 In this first Matrix sequel, you'll see things you've never seen before on a movie screen, and that's all that matters.
0.5 So let's cut to the chase. Is the second Matrix movie worth the wait? Not quite.
0.625 All the philosophical/metaphysical rambling doesn't alter the fact that this latest Matrix is a visual movie, pure and simple.
0.875 ... crafted with a careful hand... repeat viewings may be necessary to take it all in (darn the luck, huh?) There's plenty of possibilities to ponder after the credits roll
0.75 ...visually vigorous and devoutly exhilarating...a frenetic fable that's thankfully rousing and robust...undeniably rapid, exotic, and marvelous in its impressive viewing.
0.625 While it's good enough and even great at times, it just doesn't click the way the original did even though it's larger in scope.
0.8 The Matrix Reloaded is better than the original.
0.875 Pretty damn spectacular! Still smart, still amazing, still innovative and it contains one of the greatest chase scenes ever filmed. Sci-fi fans, philosophy majors and action movie buffs have every reason to be happy.
0.4 Your brain will likely feel sucker-punched by the end of this obtuse ****storm, which falls flat faster than you can say Attack of the Clones.
0.875 The Matrix Reloaded is a real kick the second time around.
1.0 When it comes to visuals, The Matrix Reloaded doesn't disappoint; in fact, the movie is probably the most realistic looking special effects feature ever made.
0.625 It's the technical wizardry that keeps "The Matrix Reloaded" going at all, which should not be the case.
0.75 A worthy sequel.
0.875 The world created so vividly by the Wachowskis is still brand new but not nearly so intimidating or alienating.
0.625 Judged strictly by the story line, this one plays like what it is, a rather meandering second act that advances the plot only slightly and doesn't pretend to be a complete or self-sufficient film.
0.75 At times, the action here seems a little too choreographed for its own good. But admittedly, that's a minor thing, considering how stunning some of it is.
0.75 A kinetic, digital feat.
0.8 MATRIX RELOADED is like a gorgeous but flawed woman. She looks great, and the sex is phenomenal, so you overlook the fact that a lot of what she says is just so much pretentious drivel.
0.75 One dazzling (if overlong) bridge.
0.7 The action is fun to watch but it doesn't get the old heart pumping which pretty much sums up The Matrix Reloaded.
0.6 The good news is that the excitement and special effects are amazing once again.
0.9 This sequel is not just reloaded, it is an entirely new arsenal.
0.7 Be prepared to feel let down whenever the action lets up.
0.875 It's safe to say that anyone buying a ticket to the film purely to see more crazy-cool, high-wire kung fu and learn how the Wachowskis and visual-effects supervisor John Gaeta top the 'bullet-time' effect will come away from Reloaded smiling.
0.625 Ultimately like a long theme park ride.
0.75 Everything The Matrix was and more. That is [its] strength and [its] failing.
0.625 Like the martial arts movies it draws on, Reloaded uses plot points as excuses to move from one piece of fight choreography to the next.
0.5 The Matrix Reloaded is no better or worse than its predecessor, improving upon certain aspects (the characters and action scenes) while lacking some of the stronger elements of the first film (the overall imagination and ingenuity).
1.0 We're in glorious new territory here.
0.875 The Wachowskis cleverly fiddle with their formula, pulling back each curtain only to show us another curtain.
0.75 Walks the line between "impossible to take seriously" and "impossibly, seriously fun"
0.7 This movie can be watched and appreciated on many levels - but the bottom line is the movie is really a hyper-realistic, 2 1/2 hour, 160 million dollar trailer for The Matrix Revolutions. That being said, it's a pretty darn cool trailer.
0.8 Sci-fi epic is broader, brisker and -- for better and for worse -- about what you'd expect from part two of a trilogy.
0.75 If there's one thing The Matrix Reloaded fortifies, it's that the Wachowski brothers are born filmmakers through and through.
1.0 If The Matrix is considered one of the best sci-fi movies ever made, then The Matrix Reloaded is a pretty damn excellent sequel to one of the best sci-fi movies ever made...and that's good enough for me.
0.5 Viewers are likely to be amazed by what occurs, but will then realize that they've witnessed style over substance.
0.75 This picture never accumulates the sense of shared adventure that the first one did, and though the special effects are even better than before, they cannot be new twice.
0.75 This is probably the film that devotees had hoped for, but it will certainly flummox bystanders sucked into the multiplex by the hype.
0.75 Once the action gets started - and unfortunately that takes a while - Reloaded is nearly as invigorating as the original.
1.0 "Matrix Reloaded" is a smart, exotic, erotic, intriguing action film; a superhero sci-fi film for adults.
0.75 Reloaded seems less tired than X2.
0.6 More comic book-like and less intriguing than the original, the film's punch-drunk cyber-mysticism still has a darkly seductive allure that sets it apart from juvenile, Star Wars-style space opera.
0.4 While it is both naive and unfair to expect lightning to strike terrain this fertile twice, the most distressing thing about the reloading of The Matrix is just how much it feels like The Phantom Menace.
0.75 The eye-popping special effects in The Matrix Reloaded -- possibly the coolest, boldest and most fluid ever put on screen -- should please even jaded moviegoers.
0.625 More special effects. More fight sequences. More chases. More stunts. More neo-philosophical babble. But more, in this case, adds up to less.
0.75 Reloaded piles on much more fighting and firepower but lacks the impact of the original.
0.75 Eyes will pop, nerves will jangle, thoughts will be provoked and other summer blockbusters will shrink in comparison. But to quote from one of the few cultural touchstones not referenced in this film: 'Houston, we've got a problem.'
0.75 By itself, The Matrix Reloaded is deeply flawed, but ultimately entertaining.
0.75 While I enjoyed it immensely, Reloaded didn't upgrade my system like the first one did.
0.6 Dark, with jaw-dropping effects, stunning action beats and a chase to end all chases, The Matrix Reloaded is a movie-going dare.
0.625 Much-anticipated sequel to The Matrix is both phenomenally talky and loaded with action and effects. How can this be? It's long.
0.7 The martial arts sequences are breathtakingly staged.
0.75 While it's exhilarating fun, as an overall piece of storytelling, this reboot never really hits the heights of the ultra-cool The Matrix, which re-invented the rules for sci-fi epics in 1999.
0.875 For sheer exhilarating spectacle, The Matrix Reloaded is the film to beat this year.
0.625 As a piece of razzle-dazzle, shut-your-mouth -and-slap -you-silly eye candy, Reloaded more than delivers. But where's the head candy? Where's the complexity? Where are the goods?
0.75 A pretty good amusement park ride.
0.75 On balance, The Matrix Reloaded does an admirable job of filling the niche it's supposed to -- that of an action-oriented science fiction adventure.
0.7 Une suite a mi-chemin entre deception et reussite.
0.75 Reloaded might not have the power to change the way you see the world, but it just may change the way you look at movies.
0.85 Everyone's expectations are through the roof for this one, and for the most part, it delivers.
0.7 Eye-popping sci-fi.
0.5 For such a rich visual movie, Reloaded tells far more than it shows.
0.875 In the immortal words of Neo: 'Woah.'
0.875 An immensely skillful sci-fi adventure.
0.75 The thrill isn't gone from the sequel, but the surprise is, and it hurts more than you'd think.
0.9 Visually slick, action-packed.
0.6 The Wachowski brothers likely wanted to provide their film with that greater 'meaning', but did they have to make great stretches of it boring as well?
0.7 A ping-pong battle between slowly-spoken philosophical mumbo-jumbo and some truly explosive action cinema.
0.875 If the level of great admirer falls somewhere under the blinding enthusiasm of the 'Wachowskis are visionaries' clan, then color me a member. But even the clinical system of the Matrix has some bugs to repair from time to time.
0.5 To label the film as a 'bad' movie would be too harsh. It's not a bad movie. 'Earth-Shattering disappointment of monumental proportions' more accurately fits the bill.
0.8 Either do it right and deepen an already rich storyline, or give in and make an unabashed action movie. Fortunately, even with its many flaws, The Matrix Reloaded succeeds admirably as the latter.
0.4 Simply not as satisfying as the original.
0.5 One incredibly cool...kung-fu melee; one jaw-dropping, 100-mph, against-traffic freeway chase; and way, way too much pseudo-philosophical yappity- yappity-yap.
0.7 The Matrix Reloaded may have it's problems, but it certainly isn't a bad film. It suffers from many of the same problems of other 'great' film sequels
0.75 There's virtually no one in Zion over the age of 30 except for esteemed character actor Anthony Zerbe, and he's so far past 30 he couldn't find his way back if 30 left a trail of Scotch Highballs.
0.7 It only takes about 45 seconds for it to grab you by the throat and slap you across the face.
0.8 A passionate, over-powered and mostly unfathomable upgrade of 1999's groundbreaking, breathtaking and equally cryptic original.
0.75 Be prepared for sensory overload when you enter the world of eccentric auteurs Andy and Larry Wachowski.
0.8 might be hard to swallow but it's so delicious you just can't help but want more. Not unlike one of those gobstoppers you can find in any candy store - Hard to chew, nice to endure, if you will.
0.6 The effects here are dazzling, there is no other word for it. . . but when it comes to serious food for thought, this is just an appetizer compared to the first film
0.8 The action knocks your socks off even when the movie itself is technically playing it safe.
0.625 So magnificently punch-drunk on its own sense of the messianic that it's possible to appreciate this great, sloppy, bloated beast as something of a masterpiece of high camp.
0.875 The Wachowski Brothers, with their vision of this mysterious future world and a new era of cinema, have kicked off 2003's blockbuster summer with a ten-megaton explosion.
0.875 The X-Men series is just candy for kids compared to The Matrix trilogy, a sci-fi series for grown-ups.
0.625 For those who go in knowing, at heart, it's just a Joel Silver-produced sci-fi film with some presumptions, it'll be fine.
0.9 Digital freedom from physical laws unleashes all manner of chase dynamics, exhilarating to the max... an action choreographer's dreamstate.
0.375 Philosophically inconsequential, but at least submit to the film's sure-to-be-classic highway sequence, cheesy techno music and all.
0.6 There's no doubt that the Wachowski Brothers have a vision, but where they once seemed inspired, now it feels like they're just showing off.
0.875 Whether you get 20% or 100% of the intellectualizing, & even if there's no sense in fighting software with military hardware & Kung Fu; it's simply a marvel to watch.
0.3 comes with all the silliness and sugar-coated pop fanaticism that is found in Rodriguez's lesser kids films
0.2 No matter how many dimensions you slap on the poster, there's no accounting for lazy workmanship. Can Robert Rodriguez please make Sin City 2 now?
0.75 Clever and strange, 'Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D' is a psychedelic action movie that will boggle and entertain the minds of adults and kids alike. If you like wordplay, you will like it all the more for the witty dialogue.
0.625 Rodriguez reboots his eight-years-dormant franchise, with surprisingly entertaining and loosey-goosey results
0.25 A concatenation of scatological humor likely to keep only tiny tykes in stitches and howling away at a poop and fart jokes.
0.4 ...fairly routine fare, even for kids, and aside from cool gadgets it's just a bit dull.
0.2 Don't take your kids to see this. I never thought I would say this, but take them to see The Smurfs instead. It's a smurfload better than this pile of smurf.
0.4 Now then, what of the movie? Well, it stands a better chance of getting up your nose than crummy old AromaScope, that's for sure.
0.6 ... a shiny, complicated toy that's silly and doesn't really do anything, but is fun to play with.
0.375 The presence of Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino is sorely missed. Then again, more power to them for staying away from a movie that would smell in any dimension.
0.6 In Spy Kids 4, women are warriors and men freely cry about their fathers, and it's this inversion that made me love the movie a little bit extra.
0.2 A 3D film aimed mostly at children.
0.4 Kids will be mildly amused by it.
0.2 The mind boggles before being lulled into a stupor of inanition by this latest instalment of Robert Rodriguez's increasingly cheap-looking franchise.
0.4 Rodriguez directs the movie with his trademark kineticism, but a flimsy and uninventive script means there's little investment in the characters or their actions.
0.375 A daft plot seemingly jacked from the most brainless of Saturday morning cartoons.
0.2 Rodriguez's family franchise about underage secret agents limps into its fourth installment with shiny CGI and frequent fart jokes to hold the attention spans of the underage and undemanding.
0.4 Kids might enjoy the cheesy jokes, the shiny gadgets and the pooping dog but for adults it is snooze time all the way.
0.375 Rodriguez's various family-geared movies - notably the "Spy Kids'' series - have been annoying creative clunkers, the one area where doing things his way has seemed like an iffy way.
0.2 An endless series of scatological jokes saps the charm out of nearly every scene, and there's little effort to create an interesting mystery at the movie's center.
0.625 A pleasant time-waster kids will love with a pro-family togetherness message parents can appreciate...
0.5 This fourth "Spy Kids" picture isn't so much bad as it is just boring, lacking the buzz and brio of even some of the earlier entries in the series.
0.5 The rhythm is off, a predicament Rodriguez addresses with copious - nearly constant - excrement and evacuation humor, and sudden turns into wide-eyed sincerity.
0.2 Feels more like straight-to-DVD filler than a chapter in one of the last decade's most entertaining and sophisticated family-film franchises.
0.4 Feels more like a cheap kids' TV series than an actual movie.
0.6 Watchable, gadget-happy children's adventure that scrapes a pass thanks to likeable characters, pacey direction, some decent gags and Jessica Alba in a leather catsuit...
0.625 So plain-faced and literal-minded in its juvenile pandering that it's hard to dismiss it as a mere cash-in.
0.2 Positive messages can't save worst film in action series.
0.375 Rodriguez only needs the script to take us from one gimmick to the next, and his lack of attention to it shows.
0.2 a miserable excuse for underling entertainment
0.5 It simply entertains at a basic level without leaving a lasting impression.
0.6 Far more coherent than its immediate predecessor, Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D benefits greatly from its two likable young leads and some of the series' wittiest, pun-filled writing.
0.4 Robert Rodriquez delivers another irritating Spy Kids movie, Spy Kids: All The Time In The World in 4D, with the redundant gimmick of scratch and sniff cards, designed to reveal on-screen aromas. Well, I didn't smell turkey. In fact, I smelt nothing.
0.4 Rodriguez' first film was the celebrated low-budget El Mariachi. This one, a chaotic mess from start to finish, must be something like his nadir.
0.625 Let's make things clear right now: Spy Kids: All the Time in the World is juvenile, rough around the edges, and frequently clumsy. And yet...and yet...the film is so likably innocuous and unsuspectingly wise that it works better than it should.
0.4 A kids' flick that's big on eye candy but which has a plot even youngsters will find wearingly familiar.
0.2 Sadly it's all fart jokes and smart-alec preteens - the stuff that can make taking kids to the pictures a chore.
0.2 Robert Rodriguez's children's films are becoming terrific reasons to get sterilised.
0.2 Spy Kids - All the Time in the World is in four dimensions - the extra one being smell - and I hated the lot.
0.4 This is a shoddy affair with anodyne first-timers Blanchard and Cook almost as annoying as Ricky Gervais's phoned-in voiceover of an animatronic terrier with a poop obsession.
0.4 A passable shake-up, even if its 'Aroma-scope' experiment stinks. Like Ricky Gervais, the Spy Kids franchise could drone on - sorry, go on - forever.
0.5 It's not without its pleasures, but I'll stick with The Tune.
0.6 Though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs, its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before.
0.625 Outrageousness is all Plympton seemed to be going for this time. We miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride.
0.8 Zany, exuberantly irreverent animated space adventure.
0.875 It's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman.
0.75 A new film from Bill Plympton, the animation master, is always welcome.
0.4 For the future, one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band, a professional screenwriter.
0.5 Will no doubt delight Plympton's legion of fans; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting.
0.625 Silly, sexy, and filled with music.
0.8 A hilarious, off-beat slice of 80s cheese.
0.4 Not as funny as it thinks it is.
0.8 Stupid but wonderful.
0.2 But this movie is hard to take. Sorry, go back to your own planet.
0.2 I never got into this. It just doesn't make me laugh.
0.4 Unfortunately, this movie isn't
0.6 An entertaining guilty pleasure.
0.6 Kooky and colorful little cult flick. If you're a fan of anyone in the cast, consider it a curiosity rental.
0.75 Only the most strident of advocates for political correctness will take offence at the harmless fun.
0.5 All this could be frothy fun or irritating, depending on your taste or mood.
0.625 Even running out of steam as it eventually does, there is zany goofball fun for the undiscriminating moviegoer.
0.75 A lighthearted and goofy musical comedy about a love affair between an extraterrestrial and a manicurist.
0.6 While it's hardly genre-changing, this is a nice dose of fun, family entertainment.
0.4 Everything about this "Race" comes off as a cheap also-ran, with little of that ol' Disney magic anywhere to be found.
0.5 Race to Witch Mountain is pretty standard kiddie fare: Cute, precocious children are protected by a world-weary, wisecracking father figure and one-liners abound.
0.625 A reasonably satisfying family film that updates things while staying true to the adventurous, sci-fi spirit of the originals.
0.375 If it's possible for a movie to be agressively bland, Race to Witch Mountain is that movie. [Blu-ray]
0.5 ...suffers from a pervasively stagnant atmosphere that effectively drains the energy right out of its high-octane moments...
0.6 Race with your kids to see it.
0.6 Race to Witch Mountain is the first kids' film in ages to have action beats that measure up to Hollywood's grownup action fare.
0.6 In 35 years, people probably will have forgotten 'Race to Witch Mountain' the way my generation has amnesia when it comes to its 1975 predecessor 'Escape to Witch Mountain.'
0.5 Johnson holds his own against the cute wunderkinder, but nobody's a match for the f/x onslaught of the noisy climax.
0.6 This kids' adventure from Disney is amiable with nice performances.
0.2 The result is a disappointingly unadventurous adventure, with characters and events that never involve us.
0.6 There are decent special effects, and Johnson can play it tough while also being a kid-friendly presence.
0.4 Cue a not very dazzling chase movie.
0.6 Family audiences in search of Easter entertainment will not feel disappointed by what is basically one long chase and the film will make a great theme-park ride.
0.2 This surely has to be the last of the series.
0.6 The pre-Star Wars Disney sci-fi adventure Escape to Witch Mountain gets a 21st-century reboot here, with beefed-up action, hyperactive editing and even a few shout-outs to George Lucas's blockbuster classic thrown into the mix.
0.5 In the long run, one would be advised to walk slowly and sluggishly, not race hurriedly, to the so-called new and improved findings at weak-kneed Witch Mountain.
0.6 Once the action gets going, it's easy to forget that the plot has left for the planet La-La and just enjoy the fun.
0.6 An unexpectedly entertaining mixture of good, clean Disney fun with some rather more modern action scenes, lent charm by Johnson's natural swagger. One of the better family films in a while.
0.333333333333 It's pacy all right, but glib and uninvolving for grown-ups, though perhaps furnished with enough in the way of spaceships, lasers and digital explosions to pacify undemanding little 'uns of an afternoon.
0.6 It's a rattling good chase movie. The young aliens have useful tricks. Johnson is the contractual comic liability. Perfect holiday nonsense.
0.6 Witch Mountain is a full-throttle adventure that features at least half a dozen cracking action sequences, some adult-pleasing comic one-liners.
0.4 Race To Witch Mountain promises sci-fi but ultimately delivers lo-fi. Its themes are predictable and its look generic: this is one Race you may want to sit out.
0.6 One minute Seth is solid enough to stop a speeding 4x4, next he's panicking over an approaching UFO. Such cheating robs the film of tension: we need to know limits to start caring.
0.6 While this isn't a bad film, it's a touch too dry and maybe even a bit too slow for it to be the rush it should be.
0.6 Race proves a fun, snappy update to a goofy kiddie cult film.
0.4 The cast of Race to Witch Mountain do their best, but they're let down by some poor effects and a lazy script.
0.6 This completely revamped action movie is enjoyably watchable, even though there's not a moment of suspense in its squeaky clean plot.
0.75 A gleeful throwback to the era of Disney's '70s live-action movies that aimed only to offer good clean fun.
0.75 [The Rock's] skill at making the transformation from an "aliens are all around us" skeptic to a true believer is the rock solid foundation [for] this delightful kids' flick.
0.6 If only they had told that Predator dude to go back to the right set . . . .
0.25 Some kids might like "Race to Witch Mountain." But more discerning kids might not.
0.5 AnnaSophia Robb and Alexander Ludwig are fine, but this 'X Files' for small fry has about as much heft as a bubble of swamp gas.
0.625 a decent and at times entertaining bit of kid-centric fantastical escapism that alternates its hectic chase sequences and special effects spectacle with comedy involving government conspiracies and a geeky sci-fi convention.
0.4 Writers Matt Lopez and Mark Bomback, with director Andy Fickman, have seasoned this empty-calorie feast for easy digestion.
0.625 'Witch Mountain' has heart, humor and a touch of magic.
0.7 Despite its obvious contrivances, it's cornball sci-fi fun.
0.625 This new version may appeal to the target audience of young kids, but for adults, it's a bit of a slog to get through.
0.5 By the numbers Disney flick; okay for kids but bland for adults
0.5 Race to Witch Mountain finds new ground that makes it fun and suitable for young children
0.75 Saves its best for last and emerges as an enjoyable and competent bit of family entertainment.
0.5 Dwayne Johnson shines alongside rising star AnnaSophia Robb, but the film's cookie-cutter plot and adolescent script make Witch Mountain hardly worth racing to.
0.5 While this film may not qualify as classic science-fiction and takes some liberties with author Alexander Key's material, at least it's fun.
0.3 The original is at least kitschy fun. So rent that before you even think about spending $40 for the family to see this.
0.4 Witch Mountain isn't nearly as soulless or crass as other recent Disney remakes, but it's definitely louder.
0.5 Race to Witch Mountain holds no surprises (even granting that it's a remake).
0.375 Witch Mountain isn't escapism but a feature-length reminder that things are bad all over.
0.75 ... exactly as advertised: a sci-fi race to save the aliens and save the world (while dropping plenty of hints for a potential sequel and franchise).
0.625 Dwayne Johnson's Race to Witch Mountain plays out like a kiddie franchise starter kit.
0.5 ...certainly not in the E.T.bracket.
0.8 Though this is squeaky clean and one you can be totally comfortable taking kids to see, it needs the comic relief of a funny sidekick and some humor.
0.6 A fun, heart-racing adventure. This one has it all.
0.7 If you're expecting a shot-by-shot remake of the original movies, you're going to be sorely disappointed. However, this is a safe and exciting adventure for the family.
0.4 If Disney insists on raiding its own vaults for remakes, maybe they'll have better luck with The Laser-Vision, Missile-Launching, Face-Shredding Cat from Outer Space.
0.6 Sci-fi remake is action packed and intense for a PG film.
0.75 An action movie for kids that adults should have no problem sitting through.
0.25 Wow, when Disney misses the 'reimagining' mark, it really misses.
0.5 The head-cracking, explosions and gunplay eventually get out of hand, considering that, revamp or no revamp, Witch Mountain is still a Disney film aimed squarely at kids.
0.6 proves that some remakes can be just as entertaining if not more so, than the original.
0.5 This is not a story that cries out to be remade every 15-20 years. And, while the special effects and acting are getting better, the story isn't.
0.5 For all that energy, the film never really goes into orbit.
0.25 Bears all the signs of having been composed by an inferior race of alien screenwriters from the Hackulon System.
0.7 A fast and furious wild ride of a movie in which the good guys are good, the bad guys are good and the car chases are pretty spectacular.
0.5 Director Andy Fickman does an OK job of keeping all the balls in the air, though when it comes to loud but bloodless action, he's all thumbs.
0.7 Race To Witch Mountain is fast and furious and the action is bound to please children, who are the target audience.
0.75 It's a fast, funny, frightening and family-friendly movie, an affectionate tribute to the original, and a vintage thrill ride enhanced by modern visual trickery, crazy characters -- and a soupcon of skepticism.
0.5 A couple of 10-year-old boys all hopped up on concession-stand soda would be ideal companions for Disney's latest: Race to Witch Mountain.
0.5 Although Race to Witch Mountain is about space travelers, little soars here. The film is so by-the-book (and we don't mean Key's 1968 novel) that it's hard to recount it without reverting to blahblahblah.
0.75 The result may not be a diamond in the rough, but it is a nice, shiny zircon.
0.6 .... if Fickman's sole mission was to create a film that will keep children thoroughly enthralled, then it's safe to say he easily achieved his goal.
0.2 As much I disliked Disney's excuse to make more money, I now know that Nationwide is on my side. The product placement is atrocious.
0.375 A movie with plenty of action, and not much story
0.6 Modest and diverting, rough and bland, with some good (if not quite Bette Davis caliber) actors and so-so special effects.
0.4 ...a film so incompetently directed and poorly written that it insults kids' intelligence, much less the adults who brought them.
0.5 Kids will want to root for their alien counterparts on screen. But they are second fiddle to the Rock wracking it up.
0.4 A slick but pointless work that will probably do well for a weekend or two but which will quickly fade from memory even as the original continues to attract new legions of fans.
0.6 a textbook "crowd pleaser," a movie made to really resonate with the lowest common denominators in the demographic
0.6 While Escape was superior in story, Race does commit to an impressive scope.
0.625 Race to Witch Mountain is a satisfying snack of a family adventure. It doesn't condescend to youngsters or shortchange adults.
0.375 This is not a movie. It's a coming attraction for a theme park.
0.625 Mediocre family fare that's simply not that much fun.
0.6 Race to Witch Mountain" is made for kids, with a mix of family-friendly thrills and conspiracy mythos and special-effects action ... think of it as "The PG Files."
0.5 Given enough popcorn, kids should find it diverting; adults may be less than enthralled.
0.625 It's all fairly enjoyable, but also predictable and occasionally corny.
0.375 A flavorless sci-fi family picture that fools itself into thinking it is more grandiose than it is. Has all the thrills of a race between a slug and a hermit crab.
0.5 The film doesn't really have a plot. It's more of a premise, cartoonishly executed.
0.5 ...while "Race to Witch Mountain" rarely rises above the functional, either as storytelling or as visual kinetics, it moves like it means it and keeps Johnson front and center, either fuming or sputtering.
0.5 More like a pile of small, strange rocks that somehow landed in the same hole.
0.4 Instead of the next Schwarzenegger the Rock is the next Guttenberg and we have Disney to thank for it.
0.7 This is a fun movie, but Disney was wise to cut it off at 98 minutes. More would have been too much.
0.5 The story, acting and dialogue somehow came out weaker and creakier than before.
0.625 Since Seth and Sara only appropriated the bodies of human teenagers, I was left with a couple of questions.
0.6 It's a pleasant-enough diversion. Who knows, maybe the sequel will improve on this. Because from the looks of things at the end, there's bound to be one.
0.4 Unfortunately, there's simply no way to take something that was once fresh and transform it into a referential collage of all that followed without caving to every imaginable genre cliche in the Hollywood playbook.
0.6 0.5
0.375 Unless you find the idea of killer mummy wraps particularly frightening, chances are you'll find this direct-to-vid thriller as ridiculous as I did.
0.6 Not bad but poor CGI muffles the scares.
0.5 Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives is boring and completely fails to engage on any level. Simply put, it's much too strange for its own good.
0.9 Uncle Boonmee is a film to be experienced for its immediacy and thought upon for its ineffability.
0.875 Fits neatly into Weerasethakul's cinema-shaking oeuvre of beautiful experimentation. [Blu-ray]
0.8 One to absorb, to wonder at, and, perhaps most significantly, to give exposure to lines of thinking that one might not be familiar with.
0.6 Beguiling, frequently baffling and frustrating.
0.625 Weerasethakul's sincerity is evident, though the film's meditative pace and vague philosophical undertones will not be for everyone.
0.8 Truly enchanting.
0.8 [Compared to Weerasethakul's earlier work] it's easier to get a handle on the edges, more opaque in the middle, and not as radical in its ideas or its execution.
0.875 If you are open, even in fancy, to the idea of ghosts who visit the living, this film is likely to be a curious but rather bemusing experience.
0.75 The movie isn't paced as a conventional narrative; its story imperceptibly droops, like a heavy frond.
0.875 What would pass for longueurs in another director's movie become commands for rumination here.
1.0 To visit with these characters is like watching what seems to be a slideshow of unrelated events, memories and reincarnation fantasies, but what connects them is a hypnotic quality and a serene embrace of both life and death.
0.5 Uncle Boonmee is a film that feels like some sort of skewed satire on the sort of drivel people will digest as art...
0.95 "A film that will linger in your thoughts and dreams for a long time after waking from its intoxicating slumber."
0.75 It takes a while to get used to Joe's peculiar style of filmmaking, but once you do, you'll go with the flow, not worrying about the abstractness of the plot.
0.75 Perhaps the best way to experience Uncle Boonmee or really any Weerasethakul film is to let his odd vision of the world sweep over you and not sweat the details too much.
0.75 If you can weather some slow patches (and there are plenty), this boldly original, oddly affecting meditation on the afterlife will reward you with moments of profundity that will linger in your consciousness (or subconsciousness) for a lifetime...
0.8 An entirely unique portrait of a man crossing over from one lifetime to the next.
0.8 "Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives" is a one-of-a-kind mixture of the extraordinary and the everyday.
0.9 masterful and unique
0.8 It's that rarity in any medium, a totally unique work of art, and that it's a bit of a mess doesn't detract much from how mesmerizing of an experience it can be.
0.8 This is a mesmerising film that is endlessly unexpected, engaging and fascinating.
1.0 A mesmerizing Thai film about death, reincarnation, and the abundant mysteries of the human adventure.
0.95 The key is to let yourself go with the meandering current of its narrative.
1.0 The deepening mysteries and almost trance-like states Weerasethakul's films produce in the viewer are by design: a purposeful sounding of the hidden potential of cinema and consciousness.
0.9 Instead of nostalgia for vanished magic, there is the recognition that magic is always present if we know where and how to look. Mr. Weerasethakul certainly knows where to look and is generous enough to share some of what he sees.
1.0 I have been a fan of Apichatpong Weerasethakul's for years, and his stature keeps growing.
0.875 Takes a sweet, long time to work its magic on you.
0.6 full review at Movies for the Masses
1.0 What you see and hear always seems perfectly natural, even if you can't exactly say why. Who needs words when you have cinema?
0.6 Mesmeric and meandering, Uncle Boonmee is worth a viewing, and it has great qualities, but as an overall experience it never quite reaches the heights it often feels like it might reach.
0.4 The narrative is devoid of any conventional structure, and the pace is punishingly slow.
0.6 Meaning may prove elusive, and boredom is never exactly kept at bay, but what's on screen is unique and beguiling enough to make it worth persevering.
0.8 A film so entrancing, original and hypnotic that the moment it finishes the immediate impulse is to watch it again.
0.6 The film's stark approach to the fantastic and supernatural won't appeal to the mainstream, despite a distinctive and visually arresting presentation.
0.8 Apichatpong doesn't use his camera to stress what we should be looking at, thinking or hearing. He uses long takes and subtle edits to generate moods, atmospheres and feelings.
1.0 It is a total wonderwork: enchanting, bizarre, complex, original.
0.8 Play along with it and enjoy one of the most bizarre and original films to come out this year.
0.6 A gentle trance-out and the strangest Palme d'Or winner in a while.
0.4 Mesmeric in the way that staring at a tank of tropical fish for a couple of hours is mesmeric. Still, just the ticket if you're high, recovering from major surgery or are a cat.
0.4 Less a Palme D'Or than a Dalme Sn'Or.
1.0 Apichatpong Weerasethakul's Palme d'Or winner Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives is a unique and mesmerising piece of filmmaking, but it won't be to everyone's taste.
0.8 Easy to eulogise but tough to explain. Funny strange, funny ha-ha and finally affecting, it's a film of poignant, quietly patient power...
0.3 There's crap, and there's pseudo-intellectual crap. Uncle Boonmee apparently falls into the latter category.
0.75 A beautiful, slow-moving meditation on life, death, and relationships that transcend time and space.
0.6 Fascinating, hypnotic and deeply, deeply weird, Apichatpong's Palm d'Or winner is a beautifully shot Thai drama that will baffle and amaze in equal measure.
1.0 Shooting with an unfussy verite aesthetic, Apichatpong crafts a delicate, enveloping spell, creating a world where the intrusion of the supernatural is almost commonplace.
1.0 Uncle Boonmee is a delightfully original, if not entirely explicable, story of a dying Buddhist man's journey into the jungle.
0.75 Throughout Uncle Boonmee, Weerasethakul sees weirdness and wonder in the mundane, from the taste of tea to a daylight stroll across a field alive with the buzz of honeybees.
1.0 This is a visionary film in the director's characteristic style: mysterious, dreamlike, gentle, quiet, magical.
1.0 It's barely a film; more a floating world. To watch it is to feel many things -- balmed, seduced, amused, mystified.
0.8 A whimsical essay about the final days of a villager suffering from kidney failure it is undoubtedly one of the filmmaker's most accessible works.
0.6 Animated DVD based on popular toys has plenty of violence.
0.7 As epic summer movies go, At World's End was pretty good. But don't try to make sense of anything, or you may suffer an aneurysm.
0.6 Just how much are you willing to forgive Johnny Depp and that sea-dog swagger of his?
0.5 While it fails in matching the unpredictable excitement of the original, this is more of what I'd want in Pirates sequels. Just a little less of it.
0.7 If nothing else, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End's ambition and moral ambiguity still set it apart from the pack, but as a send off to the trilogy it staggers across the finish line more than winning out right.
0.75 [Verbinski] borrows from a half-dozen mythologies to construct a fitting punishment for the culture of narcissism, compulsive consumption, and greed that makes movies like this one necessary.
0.5 Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a hearty, bumpy sea marathon. For some, it will be a fun ride; for others, it will be an ordeal. I'm somewhere in between.
0.7 a little disapointing, but still fun
0.4 A few laughs, some fantastic CGI and a great cameo from Keith Richards aside, this is turgid and tiresome.
0.6 Both sequels to the original film are confusing and long. But the third does improve on the second, because at least something happens.
0.5 At World's End's greatest sin, just like the second film, is that it forgets to be fun.
0.625 For a long time -- although definitely not all the way to the interminable finale of this whale of a nautical exercise -- you're likely to enjoy what you'll see
0.6 Swashbuckling action, but too many puzzling plots.
0.6 When it hits, it is absolutely the best of the three films, but when it misses, it is endlessly tedious.
0.375 Yo ho ho and a bottle of regulations!...has the soul of a three-hour U.N. committee meeting. Gods' bodkins, me hearties, this movie blows like a whale from the vasty deep.
0.4 POTC: At World's End strives for epic-ness, but it's not an epic. It's fluff. And fluff should never, ever exceed more than 1 hour and 47 minutes, including end credits.
0.75 The best in the series.
0.625 "At World's End" is a sweepingly ambitious movie that, alas, takes too long making its point, and far less effort in doing something meaty with the opportunities given to it.
0.6 Buoyed by luck, comedy and state-of-the-art special effects, it has not only survived the journey intact, it's also washed down its decks, ready for a whole new cycle of movies to begin.
0.4 It's a knockabout, scattershot affair.
0.625 while it maintains some vestiges of daring, I fear that the filmmakers may have bought too deeply into their own delusions of grandeur
0.6 Overlong, over-plotted and frequently dull threequel that only really gets into gear in the last forty minutes thanks to an impressively action-packed climax.
0.4 While the first two films skirted by on charm and sheer energy, At World's End clunks through three hours of excessive characterization and exposition -- and none of it makes any sense.
0.4 World's End is duller than a Disneyland ride during a power cut.
0.4 The unfunny doppelgangers only remind us, unfortunately, of how formulaic and mechanical this once inspired turn has become.
0.7 This might be a stretch considering its two hour and forty-eight minute runtime, but you'll definitely get your money's worth.
0.4 Dead men tell no tales -- but if they did, they would probably make more sense than the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.
0.9 It was a whole lot of fun!
0.5 A lazy rehash spun together to satisfy booty-hungry studio heads ... it's as explosive as a firearm loaded with wet gunpowder
0.6 Bland, bloated, and at times, bewildering, this third serving is merely yo-ho-hum.
0.625 Here, death has little sadness and no permanence; it's as if the characters, being part of a mostly CGI world, are destined to exist forever in digital limbo, like deleted e-mails.
0.375 ...it hardly seems likely that anybody will have the stones to sit through this mess more than once.
0.6 I missed the jokes and carefree spirit of the crew of the Black Pearl. I missed the simple pleasures of the walking id that is Jack bumping into the consequences of his nature. I missed the funny.
0.58 By managing to turn a Disney theme park ride into a major movie franchise, director Gore Verbinski and his collaborators, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, have done an unintentional remake of Gilliam's "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen." Gilliam did it bet
0.2 As Captain Sparrow himself observes: "The immaterial has become.....immaterial."
0.45 You will not be engaged on any level other than a purely visual one.
0.75 It's a fine summertime distraction, but woe to the viewer who elects to revisit it somewhere down the line.
0.2 The story is either incoherent or nonexistent (take your pick)...
0.8 Needless to say, it all looks and sounds absolutely fabulous, and the return of Geoffrey Rush is simply AAHRResting
0.625 Better than the trilogy's second chapter, but not by a lot. Pirates 3 runs overlong and plays more to its weaknesses at times than it does its strengths.
0.8 Like the popcorn movies of old, (Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End) is an experience as much as it is a film, a chance for audiences to get lost in elements they rarely experience in life.
0.25 It's yo-ho-ho and a bottle of dumb!
0.5 I'll bet most 'Pirates' fans will defend this final chapter, yet realize it has reached the end of its usefulness.
0.8 While this third installment is both the biggest and most effects-laden of the three, it feels less like corporate filmmaking than Dead Man's Chest did.
0.5 Trying to follow this mess left me at wit's end with At World's End.
0.75 Elizabeth Swann is officially one of the best female characters in Hollywood history.
0.05 A bloated, repetitive sea saga that is the cinematic equivalent of pigging out at a fast food franchise.
0.75 Who cares that this blockbuster is an incoherent, overplotted mess, when it comes stocked with a charismatic protagonist plus enough swashbuckling action and spooky special f/x to make you forget the fact that the story is impossible to keep straight?
0.5 ...for all its silly goings-on, senseless violence, and perpetual, empty motion, one may still find a few pleasures.
0.67 The first five minutes make it clear this is not a film for little ones. The rest of its overlong 168 minutes manages to also eliminate almost everyone else.
0.3 If it's true that if you put 1,000,000 monkeys at 1,000,000 typewriters, one will type out Hamlet, the script for this film is what the other 999,999 will produce.
0.5 Gone are the clever, innovative action sequences, and practically gone is the tongue-in-cheek handling of the material.
0.375 It is debatable whether a movie can be "blockbustered" to death, but I advance this one as Exhibit A. Almost every frame of it feels manufactured to fit a preconceived - and inaccurate - notion of what a bigger, "better" sequel should be.
0.5 Dear readers Bruckheimer pulled a Bruckheimer. I am a huge fan of his action packed plot-lite escape t the movies. But, in Pirates 3 the mega-producer took a diamond of a franchise and shattered it into sand.
0.625 Despite its length and failure to sell a love story, I mostly enjoyed this buoyant surreal adventure.
0.8 With state-of-the-art everything, this is the 'Pirates' to top them all.
0.625 Alternately exciting and exhausting, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End may occasionally sail off course, but it never runs completely aground.
0.75 The film is slow in delivering its goods, but At World's End finally finds the mad fun and rousing action that fans expect.
0.8 It's beautifully shot, with lots of colorful characters, many astonishing special effects (though some approach a numbing quality), and much humor. The secret to enjoying the Pirate trilogy is to view them as operatic comedies.
0.375 Unfortunately, once in front of the camera Depp isn't given anything interesting or funny to do. So this fine actor is left to drag out the same shtick that once seemed refreshing -- three films and an Oscar nomination ago.
0.375 Depp descends into the shallows of self-parody, and the plot, keen to tie up every narrative loose end, manages to be simultaneously expansive and incomprehensible.
0.625 The film runs nearly three hours long and feels like it.
0.5 The tragedy is, the last two films are exactly what we feared the first one would be: corporate entertainment, heavy yet frivolous, trying to buy our love with bloated spectacle.
0.75 Worth seeing for the jaw-dropping action, the doses of irreverent humor and of course the star power of Depp, Knightley, Rush, Orlando Bloom, Bill Nighy, Chow Yun-Fat and a host of other talented actors who utter their lines with Shakespearean gusto.
1.0 ... even with the film clocking in at just under three hours, too much still doesn't seem like enough.
0.75 Sprawling and as in need of Venn diagrams for every sextuple cross as it is, "At World's End" has subtleties amid its cattywampus craziness. It's also 2007's first blockbuster worth the constantly turned crank of big-budget moviemaking.
0.4 The movie is thronged with characters new and old -- so many that none of them has room to shine; and the plot has spun completely out of control.
0.6 After watching Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, I may have jumped the gun in complaining about too many action sequences in Dead Man's Chest.
0.7 I am anxious to see it again - and this is not a common thing for me and movies that run close to three hours.
0.25 If number two was a scorned middle child fighting for attention, then Pirates 3 is a perpetual motion machine; not just because it is on autopilot, but also because it seems like it will never end.
0.8 Suficientemente divertido e absolutamente irrepreensivel em suas otimas sequencias de acao.
0.5 If you can make sense of it, you're a smarter person than I am.
0.5 Three's supposed to be a charm but you won't find much of that in Gore Verbinski's continuation of his silly, spectacular swashbuckling saga
0.5 ...it's hard to remember a recent film with a cast this strong that utterly wasted them.
0.5 And so it goes.
0.75 By the end I was not annoyed, and I did not feel gypped.
0.625 Loaded with more blubber than laughs, "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" is a-vastly too long.
0.625 By the final chaotic battle, the overwhelming feeling [the movie] generates is relief that the whole enterprise is over.
1.0 At World's End is too long, too confusing, too cluttered, too much. It's also great cinema.
0.75 World's End lacks the lugubrious quality of many big-budget blockbusters because director Gore Verbinski gives it a lightness of spirit and because the actors time their sly jokes so expertly.
0.4 It's not so much that the story is hard to follow -- it's that there's no real story being told at all. At World's End is packed with incident, but on a scene-to-scene level this leaky vessel just barely stays afloat.
0.5 The longest and talkiest installment in the blockbuster Pirates trilogy, At World's End doesn't even have the decency to provide a good action sequence until more than two hours in.
0.75 (Gore)Verbinski and (Johnny)Depp, saving the best for a stupendous effects-enhanced final (don't count on it) battle, really dock this franchise with a flourish.
0.625 this cinematic ship is so over-stuffed with characters and intricate plotlines that it's starting to take on a bit of water.
0.7 As an integral part of movie history, the only legacy that Pirates seems poised to leave is the distinction of it being the first major series about seafaring swashbucklers to succeed financially.
0.375 One longs for more scenes featuring Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End and less of everything else in this bloated, overwrought and convoluted three-hour misfire.
0.625 Minute-per-dollar, you get your money's worth, but an hour after you leave you'd be hard put to summarize the plot in any coherent way. If that's entertainment, then step right up!
0.5 Relentlessly dense and unfathomable; Depp, the heart and soul of the series, doesn't even show up till several reels in.
0.5 This film is less comedic and more sweeping than the first two, and Depp often seems to be strolling the borders of the film, commenting on it.
0.875 [Erupts] into a grand and glorious adventure at the final hour. After lying dead in the water during much of its three-part odyssey, Pirates of the Caribbean has saved the best for last. The third time is the charmer.
0.375 In terms of pure adventure, there's less of it here than in Pirates 2 -- the action doesn't really start until about two hours in, and even then it's hard to understand the shifting allegiances or make sense of why the different sides are fighting.
0.875 The third film is a startling cascade of climaxes, too long, but to complain about excess in such an exuberant bonanza is like complaining that Gibraltar has too much rock.
0.5 Ultimately the voyage is so choppy and long that into the third hour I found myself yawning, 'Yo-ho-hum and a very sore bum.'
0.7 From the stunning visual effects and well-paced action sequences to the smartly written story, Pirates closes the book on its trilogy (and opens the book on the next batch) far more elegantly and enjoyably than Spider-Man. Who'da thunk?
0.875 A thrill-a-minute extravaganza.
0.75 A vastly accomplished bit of commercial filmmaking, with all the payoffs and pitfalls that such faint praise implies.
0.6 At 15 minutes this side of three hours, it's longer than Spider-Man 3 and the last Pirates entry, which were both long enough. These are supposed to be popcorn movies, not Berlin Alexanderplatz.
0.75 The third Pirates has tender moments and smashing ones, and if you fix on Depp, you'll manage fine.
0.5 I like my action movies complicated, but At World's End is less a complexity than it is a high seas bazaar with everyone and everything vying for attention. You end up going home with nothing to show for your adventure.
0.5 The overloaded sequel exhausts without ever satisfying. Cluttered and clattering, busy with jokes that never bob to the surface of funny, it puts the 'oy!' in ships ahoy.
0.75 [Special] effects pale in comparison to Depp himself. He is, as ever, the heart and soul of the franchise.
0.6 At World's End includes a whole lot of chitchat, as the characters strain to explain this overplotted extravaganza. Sure, the pirates need reasons to swing swords at each other, but do they really need this many?
0.5 Abandon hope all ye seeking a coherent, much less satisfying, narrative.
0.625 If the previous installment, Dead Man's Chest, was a classic No. 2, antic and insultingly unresolved, World's End tips the ship too far in the opposite direction. The first two hours of this 168-minute leviathan are bafflingly action-free.
0.7 The cannibals, coconuts and landlocked locations [of Dead Man's Chest] have been replaced by the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable.
0.75 It's more entertaining than the muddled middle of the trilogy. It rounds off the narrative in a satisfying way that eluded Shrek and Spider-Man.
0.875 If you loved the first two movies, you're going to love this one, and for good reason. Verbinski wonderfully mixes comedy, action and drama, and gives each character something special to do.
0.75 Is this third installment an overblown, drawn-out spectacle with more plot twists than a pretzel factory? Perhaps. Does it still deliver a visually stunning, wham-bam conclusion to a rousing pirate trilogy? Absolutely.
0.7 Anytime something suspenseful might be occurring, there's always a joke defusing it somewhere. And every time that happens, it's welcome.
0.625 The movie ends up like Davy Jones himself -- many-tentacled, full of bluster, and devoid of a beating heart.
0.9 Exciting and entertaining...and be patient through the long end credits for a revealing epilogue as the salty seafarers sail on.
0.75 ...any movie that involves something called the 'nine pieces of eight' doesn't really care if you can follow it.
0.6 click for full review
0.875 The promise for a hopeful tomorrow that spectacles like the Pirates of the Caribbean are more than just a dying cinematic breed destined to be just another theme park attraction.
0.75 the most brutal, the wackiest and certainly the trippiest of the 'Pirates' pictures... If it's overloaded and a bit overly complicated, that's not exactly unusual for these movies.
0.65 The finale ends up going on so long that by the time the 'important' events occur at the end I couldn't find it within myself to care anymore. I had been swashed, buckled and CGIed into apathy.
0.25 Bloated beyond comprehension, overplotted to the point of aggravation, and about as soulless as a ship captain specter, [the film] is a total mess.
0.75 Director Gore Verbinski continues to deliver the big-budget goods.
0.875 An epic spectacle in every sense of the word, "Pirates 3" is a non stop journey to all corners of the earth.
0.9 Yep, it's a bit too long and more than a little convoluted. It's still one of the best times I've had at the movies this year.
0.25 Given its origins as a theme park ride, it's apt that Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy has experienced a trajectory not unlike that of a rollercoaster: an initial high, followed by repeated plummets to nauseating lows.
0.6 At World's End, shows that Hollywood excess, when combined with the right combination of actors and an occasionally smart script, can work out quite nicely, thank you very much.
0.7 Despite a rather dull and uninspired opening, the last hour of action and resolution makes for a suitably satisfying ending.
0.6 The effects are spectacular, Knightley and Bloom have more to chew on and more romance to play, and Depp, vamping multiple versions of the ditz he created for this role, is uproarious.
0.5 Rum should be mandatory for every man, woman, and child misguidedly attempting to make sense of the frantic Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.
0.7 Pirates 3 is better than Pirates 2 for one very good reason: Forget Captain Jack, Captain Barbossa is back!
0.4 It drifts along in its own sort of doldrums, two minutes of not terribly exciting story followed by ten minutes of special effects, some of which are dandy, most of which demonstrate the textbook definition of overkill.
0.8 The entertainment life raft to be found in these waters is the aura of mystery and adventure provided by a masterful technical crew.
0.5 It won't matter whether you've seen the first two Pirates movies or not. You'll still be confused.
0.6 For the diligent and the faithful, director Gore Verbinski and screenwriters Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott, laboring under the bombastic tutelage of Jerry Bruckheimer, have assembled another collection of exciting set-pieces with bellowed dialogue.
0.875 The most visually spectacular, action-packed and surreal of the adventures of Capt. Jack Sparrow.
0.7 Just enough surprises to keep us gripped, and laughing, right through the impenetrable, overwrought plot.
0.6 The plot's a trippy, twisty mess, and it's far too long, but it looks fantastic and makes some bold choices in its execution. And once again Jack's back to save the day.
0.625 After the film's final act at Shipwreck Cove, one does feel a sense of satisfaction with the Pirates series, the glow of a rum punch and an ocean sunset.
0.5 Producer Jerry Bruckheimer does deserve a shoutout: It takes a kind of genius to sucker audiences into repeatedly buying the same party tricks.
0.625 The thrilling final hour is almost enough to make one forget how much of a labor it is to trudge through the first two-thirds -- almost, but not quite.
0.25 Roger wouldn't be so jolly if he had to sit through Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, a tiresome, disorienting walk down a 165-minute-long plank.
0.5 Left to do most of the movie's heavy lifting, Knightley and Bloom are still so flavorless that they make Rice Cakes seem like a feast for the senses.
0.5 At World's End is visually exciting but after three movies I'm still confused about this plot.
0.5 There are some very nice moments throughout that give one hope along the way, but when the conclusion arrives, disappointment is unavoidable.
0.8 Gruesome yet imaginative teen psychosexual drama.
1.0 The inner tension of the film emerges from Jackson's enjoyment of the girls' bustling insanity and then his gradual withdrawal from it.
0.875 This incredible film may be director Peter Jackson's masterpiece.
0.8 Fantasy and reality blur in a chilling film that shows Jackson's limitless potential
0.8 The movie that first got Jackson & Winslet noticed
1.0 Peter Jackson creates a rich, haunting atmosphere, deftly juggling the eerily giddy fantasy world of the girls and their harsh, violent reality.
0.8 A disturbing, boldly conceived story.
0.875 An odd, but mostly effective mix of melodrama, fantasy and voice-over.
1.0 Beautifully, horribly passionate.
0.8 One of the most genuinely disturbing films I have ever seen.
1.0 Despite the undeniable merits of Jackson's other works, Heavenly Creatures strikes me as the best film he has made.
1.0 Powerful
1.0 A beautiful, haunting masterpiece from Peter Jackson, and proof that The Lord of the Rings isn't the only rabbit in his hat.
0.8 Taut, clever, and fronted with two excellent performances, this is a clever choice for Jackson's first step into mainstream filmmaking.
0.8 17-year-old Kate Winslet made her film debut in this compelling blend of true crime and dark fantasy...
0.5 ...the writer and director, Peter Jackson, could not decide what kind of movie he wanted to make...
0.875 Revealed in unforgettable fashion by a capable director, the events that unfold in this film are not easily forgotten.
0.875 What makes Jackson's film enthralling and frightening is the way it shows these two unhappy girls, creating an alternative world so safe and attractive they thought it was worth killing for.
0.8 ...A work of remarkable clarity and vision, as well as one of the most original pictures of this or any other year.
1.0 An unforgettable experience.
0.75 This is a film with more visual creativity than many fantasy films.
0.9 Heavenly Creatures is dazzling; a perversely original psychodrama.
1.0 Heavenly Creatures is definitely one of the most engrossing and best films of the 90s.
0.5 A movie that begins with high tension gradually fizzles out.
0.83 While you might expect a cheap quickie designed to cash in on the Tim Burton feature ... Malice in Wonderland is actually an honest and at times intriguing updating of the classic set in modern times, in the cockney underworld of South London.
0.6 Genuinely original interpretation of the Brit gangster and Lewis Carroll's surreal tale.
0.2 Quite apart from the fact that it mistakes sexism and homophobia for sardonic liberal rib-tickling, even at 80 minutes, the film feels like a brash, crass and boneheaded music promo that's been stretched to breaking point.
0.4 Malice In Wonderland does little to remind you of the performances that once had critics and even the late great Harold Pinter crowing about his talent as [Dyer] started out on the West End stage.
0.2 Despite a certain visual flair, Malice in Wonderland just isn't very good. The screenplay is the main problem - it's just too flat and unimaginative to justify the larger-than- life cartoon characters that populate the movie.
0.4 Dyer has some funny lines, and he makes the most of them, proving that he is actually a good performer, all too often marooned in endless geezer knees-ups. But otherwise it's a bit pointless and heavy-handed.
0.4 Alice's adventures lose something in their contemporary translation, and there is very little to care about. It's nicely shot, though, in the style of a 1980s music video.
0.0 Simon Fellows and screenwriter Jayson Rothwell have come up with one of the worst ever ideas for a movie and created a cinematic abomination devoid of point, humour and entertainment value.
0.4 A good idea that unfortunately doesn't quite work, thanks to poor direction and a script that's not as clever or as funny as it thinks it is.
0.2 The presence of Danny Dyer, meanwhile, has likely tipped you off to the fact that it's a) set in a world of Brit gangsters, and b) not very good.
0.6 Eventually, the stories begin to rely on simple, clever solutions rather than violent ones.
0.75 Doesn't have a unified plot, but tells a handful of mini-stories very well.
0.75 The cosmic equivalent of hearing a Homeric epic in ancient times: we thrill to the battles, we wait with bated breath for the appearance of our favorite characters, and we root for noble, righteous warriors. [Blu-ray]
0.8 As with the best science fiction, the technology of the future is used to explore the human condition of the present.
0.625 It's not to say there's not a lot wrong with the film, but rather to suggest that the chief criticisms of it being strange and "a mess" aren't among them.
0.6 An often fascinating mess, but a mess all the same.
0.25 There's the obese Brando pretending to be God while dressed in gauzy white robes like a demented pope
0.8 Amazingly, Kilmer delivers an odder performance than Brando. Creepy retelling.
0.5 In its final third, the movie goes to hell in more ways than Frankenheimer intended.
0.625 The most exciting characters are killed off too early, and what we're left with is a Satan's "Seasme Street."
0.2 I'm sure it looked good on paper. That and Kilmer's frighteningly apt mimicry of Brando's voice are about the only positive things I can say.
0.5 The movie keeps switching focus without ever getting its bearings, and when Brando exits earlier than expected, there's little but mayhem to fall back on.
0.8 Uneven; definitely has its moments.
0.8 Writer-director Hayao Miyazaki, who previously made the impressive Princess Mononoke, has created a wonderfully bizarre world filled with a gallery of creepy, and some not so-creepy, characters.
1.0 Spirited Away is unquestionably the best animated feature since Brad Bird's The Iron Giant.
0.75 What it does have is the same kind of free-floating, imaginative animation, taking wing for even wilder flights of fantasy.
1.0 Watching the Japanese cartoon epic Spirited Away is like strolling into Alice's Wonderland and seeing every wonder sprout up around you as if for the first time.
1.0 The result is nothing less than magical, a throwback to the very best of early Disney. If I can't remember the last time I was this enchanted by an animated film, it's because I was too young.
0.8 Anything but your regular 'toon, it's a (literally) fantastic experience.
0.8 Director Hayao Miyazaki's insistence on hand-drawn graphics gives the CGI visuals an ethereal charm that ensures the story is always a pleasure to behold, even during its rare moments of inaction.
0.5 ...a gorgeously animated yet sporadically entertaining endeavor that isn't quite the instant classic one might've expected...
1.0 Magnificent, spellbinding movie has a bit of edge.
1.0 Full of riches, thematic and visual, and the best way to understand them is simply to watch the film and take it all in.
0.875 Filmgoers of all ages should not pass up the opportunity to experience such a work of staggering imagination.
1.0 Magical is a word used casually about films like this, films about fantasy and childhood. Yet this one really does deserve it.
0.875 This persistently fascinating if slightly over-long fairytale is propelled by the seemingly boundless imagination of writer-director Hayao Miyazaki.
1.0 Spirited Away is wonderful.
1.0 A fractured, knotted story about adjusting to new surroundings and having courage in the face of peril.
1.0 Think you're too hip for Japanese anime about a lost ten-year-old girl whose parents turn into snorting pigs? Get over it.
1.0 Despite a dip midway through, this is a captivating fantasy that sets a new benchmark for animation.
0.8 I struggled to find the source of imperfection in this film
0.7 Not instructive, as Disney is, and not aloof, like anime. Spirited Away is fun without being a lesson, and it welcomes you in.
0.875 'Mostrando un profundo respeto por el mundo espiritual, Miyazaki logra una verdadera joya de la animacion que a veces raya en lo poetico'
1.0 It races along with the speed of a bullet train, visiting weird, enchanted places the likes of which have never been seen before.
1.0 The wonders never stop.
1.0 One of the most impressive animated features of this year, or any other.
1.0 A genuinely magical experience that both adults and children will enjoy. See it -- you'll be glad you did.
1.0 Spirited Away transcends masterpiece status. Composed of layer upon layer, it creates its own terminology.
1.0 E como se David Lynch tivesse dirigido sua propria versao de Alice no Pais das Maravilhas.
0.9 I could hardly wait for the next plot twist or astonishing set piece, not to mention what visual magic Miyazaki still had up his sleeve (and he has plenty!).
0.4 Yes, Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination, but it's also a failure of storytelling.
0.8 ...its visual style is remarkably beauteous and its creative touches abundantly imaginative.
0.8 Much of what makes the film work lies in the combination of its small touches and emotionalism, making it something more than a film for people who like to get stoned and go watch freaky animation (though it almost certainly works on that level, too).
1.0 I hate to gush in the first sentence of a review, but I absolutely love this film.
1.0 One of the greatest animated films ever made.
1.0 like a combination of 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Alice in Wonderland' retold by a clever storyteller who incorporates his own details, twists and bits of humor into the plot.
0.7 Repeatedly reminded me of the later Oz books, with Chihiro's Dorothyesque role in a surreal and perilous fantasy land.
0.6 Taking a page from "Alice In Wonderland" seems to have helped.
0.875 It's weird, wonderful, and not necessarily for kids.
0.9 The imagery is rich, colorful and imaginative -- as you'd expect from Miyazaki.
1.0 The best animated feature to hit theaters since Beauty and the Beast 11 years ago.
0.6 It's a bloody shame that the anime film with the strongest theatrical push I can remember has to be this one.
0.4 Sorry, y'all -- I give up.
1.0 Prepare to be Spirited Away by this amazing animated film.
0.875 In scene after scene, Spirited Away unleashes so much wonder and visual imagination that you end up watching the movie in a state of rapturous, awestruck bliss.
1.0 It's perplexing but always enthralling.
1.0 A feast for lovers of animation.
1.0 Miyazaki ... conjures up worlds that are wondrously bizarre yet follow their own peculiar logic.
0.75 It's easy to get lost amid the flow, as characters transform and magical powers emerge and disappear without warning.
0.75 As surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph, as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming.
1.0 This gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family.
0.875 Spirited Away is a wonderous tale for grade schoolers that never condescends or spoon feeds its themes. Miyazaki's characters and situations are so engaging that he can condemn greed and environmental negligence without ever sermonizing.
0.8 Genius and nothing but -- that's what Miyazaki means.
1.0 'Alice in Wonderland meets the East...taking full advantage of the complex powers of anime and its freedom to go wherever the mind can imagine.'
1.0 Visually imaginative, thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful, it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality.
0.8 That the story sometimes makes not a lick of sense is among its virtues, imparting as it does the exhilarating feeling that anything can happen.
1.0 A breathtakingly magical animated fable that lifts your spirits and carries you away to a world far beyond your wildest imagination.
1.0 At its heart and most importantly, Spirited Away concerns a little girl learning to honour her friends and her family by valuing herself.
0.875 The colors, textures, and settings are impressively beautiful, and the overall effect is mystical and magical, familiar and dreamlike.
0.75 There is a force of visual rapture in Spirited Away.
0.75 Children may not understand everything that happens -- I'm not sure even Miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated, and undoubtedly delighted.
0.6 'Alice's adventure through the looking glass and into zombie-land' is filled with strange and wonderful creatures.
0.9 A film not to miss.
0.8 The closest American counterpart to Spirited Away is Alice in Wonderland, but no analogy will fully prepare you.
1.0 An exquisitely formed, flawlessly executed masterwork...As sheerly imaginative and groundbreakingly wondrous as any animated motion picture you are sure to have seen.
1.0 To say that Miyazaki's intelligent, painstaking, hand-crafted anime is magical, dazzling and brilliant is an understatement - it's incomparable, ingenious and inventive -just watch for a win at Osca-time!
0.8 This is one heck of a movie, and one can see why it made all that money in Japan.
0.75 There's a sense of delicacy, and artfulness, in the tone and in the magic. The 10-year-olds who see this like to be scared, but they won't have nightmares days afterward.
0.875 Although anime features aren't all the rage in a majority of American movie theaters, Spirited Away should be a legitimate excuse to change this pending sentiment.
1.0 Steeped in lore and unabashedly surreal, the film is just charming enough for children and just bizarre enough for adults -- a perfect balance.
0.75 Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass, except that it seems to take itself far more seriously.
0.8 Miyazaki seems to have an inexhaustible supply of ideas to fill the screen and to fill screen time.
0.8 The shape-shifting creatures might be a little too imaginative for traditional audiences to get their heads around.
0.875 Miyazaki has provided another triumph, and, in the midst of the quality fall-off of Disney's in-house animated projects, a reason for animation-lovers to rejoice.
1.0 Watching Spirited Away is like watching an Eastern imagination explode.
0.875 A smashing technical achievement coming out against greed, gluttony, and pre-adolescent whining.
0.8 It almost goes without saying that the animation is jaw dropping.
1.0 Even though Disney released this film, Spirited Away points up just how by-the-numbers the studio's fare can be.
1.0 Creating a rare story-world that follows a consistent logic yet allows for most anything to happen, Miyazaki again proves himself to be more genii than filmmaker.
0.8 Spirited Away is every bit as captivating for its sheer graphic power as it is for its message of go-get-'em-girl power.
0.875 Has the mythic quality and the familiarity of great children's literature.
1.0 Miyazaki, the master animator and director of the enchanting Kiki's Delivery Service and Princess Mononoke, leads us through the looking glass as never before in Spirited Away.
1.0 An animation landmark as monumental as Disney's 1937 breakthrough Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
0.75 A lovely, evocative tour de force.
0.9 Spirited Away is one of the most richly imaginative and visually spectacular films you will see this year.
1.0 This is one of the year's best films.
0.8 Hayao Miyazaki may be one of Japan's leading animators, but in his new film, Miyazaki's Spirited Away, he also envelops you in a wondrous landscape of archetypal magic.
0.75 Spirited Away delivers chunks of Yellow Submarine and The Phantom Tollbooth -- a vividly timeless oddity suitable for many children and most stoners.
1.0 Hayao Miyazaki's breathtakingly beautiful and poetic Spirited Away -- a Japanese cross between Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz -- is such a landmark in animation that labeling it a masterpiece almost seems inadequate.
0.75 Spirited Away is too intense for the youngest viewers, but teenagers will enjoy it -- an ill-smelling 'stink-god' character is almost worthy of a Kevin Smith gross-out movie -- and grown-ups should find it diverting, if not exactly deep.
0.875 Spirited Away has the quality of a dream: It takes you places so foreign and fantastic you have no option but to yield completely to it and be spirited along.
1.0 The film is not recommended for toddlers and easily frightened little tykes. But for everyone else, kid or grown-up, this thrilling foray into magical realms is a must.
1.0 A haunting and indelible fable that warms the chilly soul of Japanese anime and points the way for its American sponsor.
1.0 Writing about a film like Spirited Away isn't about regurgitating information out for those who know little about it, but more of an experience in reminiscing.
0.7 A must-see for Japanamation fans, anyone familiar with Japanese folklore, or anyone sick of the boring stories that typically accompany American animation.
1.0 Every scene brings a new set of wonders to delight and sometimes stagger the mind
0.875 This instant classic spins a web that will snare anyone with an imagination.
1.0 A work of beauty with a surprising capacity to be cute and cunning.
0.875 A movie full of bewitching images and timeless fun and beauty.
0.875 It's a beautiful experience, nearly perfect with a fragile flowing fluid score.
0.6 An epic film of very bizarre proportions... kinda like a Japanese acid trip, but without the drugs.
1.0 Kudos to the most enchanting film of the year.
1.0 When animators go to animator heaven, they will probably view drawings of the caliber of those in Sprited Away.
0.6 It's easy to give this one credit for the mind-blowing creativity, but I can't recommend this to anyone who's not already a fan of Miyazaki or mind-expanding drugs...it's just not going to translate.
0.875 Plot here takes a backseat to set pieces that flow into each other like a glorious stream of consciousness.
1.0 Even the worst Miyazaki picture is a remarkable achievement, and Spirited Away is one of his better films.
0.6 About 50 percent campy fun -- with another 50 percent of rather dull adventure.
0.75 A heart-warming, mother-daughter drama that's also a ghost story.
0.8 Glossy romance as an angel falls for a surgeon.
0.75 The movie's eerie, slightly menacing vision of black-clad angels lurking in the shadowy corners of unsuspecting lives is genuinely haunting.
0.75 As a remake it's not as poetic as Wenders' masterpiece Wings of Desire, but it's supremely mounted (by ace lenser John Seale) and contains touching performances from Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan deviating from their respective screen images.
0.4 Superb imagery can't compensate for deficiencies of Dana Steven's script and can't hide the formulaic nature of this film.
0.4 This useless remake lacks the sheer ethereal beauty of the original Wings of Desire.
0.375 A thinking person's film for those who can't think.
0.9 A beautiful film in many ways.
0.75 Marries romance and faith in a love story as charming as a handmade valentine. It is so lovely to look at and so sincere in intent that its flaws don't matter much.
0.75 My face had been locked in that goofy, awestruck expression you experience only in Spielberg movies. City of Angels demonstrates the best kind of emotionally manipulative filmmaking.
1.0 Uma pequena perola que faz jus ao filme no qual foi inspirada.
0.75 A lovely oddity.
1.0 Una de esas que gustan cada vez mas, a medida que se ve y se vuelve a ver.
0.875 Not a typical Hollywood movie. It is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer John Seale, whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make Los Angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world.
0.6 It manages to leave a pleasant afterglow for those in the mood for its kind of loving.
0.8 Cage, Ryan and Franz are all quite good in their roles. The love story between Seth and Maggie is low-key, but it works.
0.625 The monotonic and glacially paced story eventually comes to its completely predictable and highly manipulative ending.
0.625 Standard-issue Hollywood romantic fantasy.
0.5 My idea for a tagline for this film: 'You will believe that an angel can have a boner.'
0.3 Slow, boring, and long in running time.
0.5 [Director Silberling] attempted to make a movie of pure sentiment, but whenever he seems to strike a genuine chord -- and he's clearly capable of touching the viewer -- he pushes it too far and it turns sappy.
0.4 The emphasis in City of Angels is more on simple romance than lofty questions of eternity.
0.4 Needless Hollywood dumbing-down of Wim Wenders.
0.625 The film struggles to grasp some important topics...but the film has never attained the weight needed to deal with anything of substance.
0.75 As angel movies go, this is one of the better ones, not least because Meg Ryan is so sunny and persuasive as a heart surgeon who falls in love with an angel.
0.8 The movie has some good issues to raise about choices and destiny and intimacy and the importance of smelling the roses.
0.79 A romance and a tear-jerker, but what might have come off as simply maudlin, instead shines brightly with the fine acting of Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage.
0.6 A little too heavy on the melodrama to really succeed as a great love story, this still has good performances from both stars and some heavenly moments.
0.75 Surprisingly well-executed.
0.875 Manages to update [Wings of Desire] so that the freshness and passion still exist within the characters and the story. It is a triumph of conception, camera movements, and emotional feelings.
0.75 A powerful, somber and highly intellectual picture, it is not even remotely the kind of thing one would expect to a Hollywood studio to mold into a star vehicle.
0.75 City of Angels is more romantic than profound, but Dana Stevens' script is thoughtful and intelligent, and I never felt insulted by what the characters say, do, or think.
0.8 An old-style Hollywood love story, a multi-hanky weeper.
0.3 Awash in angelic choruses and panoramic scenery, the movie aspires toward a solemnity that Dana Stevens's prosaic psychobabbling screenplay cannot support.
0.3 Glossy but with no heart, City of Angels is a smooth, unchallenging bit of fluff, about as romantic as a Hallmark card.
0.75 A fresh and fun icelandic adventure yarn.
1.0 "Just as brilliant, beautiful, and entertaining as Romero's first zombie masterpiece."
0.875 An astonishment from start to finish, from its vivid opening shot of a passenger plane in an obviously artificial sky that resembles a 'sea of blood' to the complementary final image of an invading armada of flying saucers.
0.9 Iron-clad-nutso proof that a film can be simultaneously ridiculous and smart, and should not be confused for disposable camp.
0.3 The film is so tackily written and directed, so darkly photographed and the sound so dimly recorded, that it's difficult to stay with it.
0.8 Early Cronenberg. Crude, but effective.
0.6 Cronenberg got more sophisticated later, but this is still a gross-out chiller to be proud of.
0.625 Unusually heady for a zero budget shocker, finding its sources for fear in the mind/body disconnect between man and the basement of his sexual nature.
0.8 Deliciously disgusting.
0.5 The "me" generation discarded sexual norms when it suited them, and Cronenberg offers a variety of punishments for their hypocrisy.
0.8 Despite all the nastiness there is a compulsive nature to this film that makes it very hard to switch off even when in full gory swing.
0.6 Shivers, written and directed by Cronenberg, is a paranoid, prurient sexual nightmare.
0.8 Even though the thing doesn't begin to make its presence felt till near the halfway point... the simple act of watching men discuss strategy ends up being terrifically absorbing.
0.75 It's still a very harrowing and action packed horror film...
0.6 Perhaps the most famous shot of the movie is also one of head-slapping irrelevance.
0.61 A solid, workmanlike film that holds up better than one would expect.
0.75 classic, though it didn't impress me really that much
1.0 A perfect popcorn movie.
0.75 Rather than Nyby, producer Howard Hawks is often credited for the direction of this sci-fi landmark, which features Hollywood's first space-age monster in a decade invaded by Cold War-era aliens.
1.0 Howard Hawks only produced this classic scary sci-fi feature, but it has his signature touches all over it: overlapping dialogue, smooth storytelling, compressed time and space.
1.0 All-time classic sci-fi still packs creepy wallop.
0.6 The Thing today is probably best viewed as a historical document, its shock value having been diminished through time and repetition.
0.75 Doesn't pale in comparison to John Carpenter's The Thing so much as offer a respectable podling alternative.
1.0 Classic sci-fi. One of the very best.
0.5 Watching this movie one cannot help but marvel at what had passed as scary back in 1951.
0.4 Ex Machina will work best for those who are intrigued by the mere thought of artificial intelligence.
0.75 Oscar Isaac upstages impressive visual effects and set design
0.8 While we may tire of Caleb and Nathan's boilerplate debates about AI, the film's ominous undercurrents keep us awake and attentive.
0.9 When the story is all over there has been surprisingly little story told, but the viewer will have been privy to some very sophisticated philosophical ideas.
1.0 It is a pounding psychological thriller that plants its seeds of doubt from its opening cues and builds to a tremendously affecting crescendo.
0.875 A.I. goes A.W.O.L. in this minimalist sci-fi thriller from England that's justifiably turning heads for its brilliant production design, brainy cat-and-mouse narrative, and vice-like tension.
0.9 Alex Garland's intense, mind-melding sci-fi thriller is the most intriguing movie I've seen so far this year.
1.0 A thought-provoking thriller guaranteed to keep you enthralled while reassessing the meaning of consciousness
0.875 The movie milks its desolate setting for maximum impact: Nathan's secluded house-cum-laboratory is cannily employed as its own self-contained petri dish, with existential quandaries being analyzed under Garland's morally tuned microscope.
1.0 Ex Machina is the best movie I've seen all year.
0.9 Ex Machina is memorable and downright challenging, full of sharp performances that blur the lines between humanity and programming.
0.875 Intelligent and provocative, with more than a little relevance to the world we live in.
0.8 There's a lot happening in Ex Machina and we're never entirely sure what will happen next.
0.75 It's rare for a science-fiction film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance -- but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor.
0.75 [A] methodically absorbing sci-fi drama.
0.9 For one thing, it's gorgeously shot. For another, it actually takes its own ideas seriously. This is a special film.
0.875 The film differentiates itself nicely from others of its ilk, for lurking beneath the heady stuff is a tense, frightening horror film.
0.9 Through cues both understated and not so much, the grim implications ("grimplications?") of creating a fembot with the potential to go full Skynet are clear.
0.75 Garland's primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters, even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction, the vulnerable, delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires.
0.75 Garland's commitment to his weird, edgy material, and his unhurried and thoughtful execution of it, makes "Ex Machina" something special.
0.75 A clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac.
0.875 At heart, Garland is a genre filmmaker, but his movies have more depth than their contemporaries. Additionally, he's cast his movie brilliantly.
0.75 Ex Machina packs a scientist's brain inside a thrill seeker's body, much like the nubile robot within it.
0.6 [Oscar] Isaac - buffed, bald, and bearded - is the film's dramatic center as Nathan, a man betrayed by his own genius. He struts, he speechifies, he schemes, he scolds, all friendly menace and sly frankness.
0.8 Ex Machina is incredibly slow moving and never really escalates to an exciting pace, but its slow burn mentality and ability to ignore being rushed is what makes it so enticing. This is a film that undeniably revitalizes the sci-fi genre.
1.0 Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.
0.8 This futuristic take on age-old motivations, jealousy and betrayal among them, makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout.
1.0 This is [Garland's] first turn as director, and it suits him; he's created a cautionary tale that entertains even as it forces us to think.
1.0 "Ex Machina" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.
0.875 With a stellar cast and seductive look, "Ex Machina" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.
0.625 A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story.
0.9 It's great when a movie messes with your head.
0.5 A B-movie that tried to be something better but stayed a B-movie.
1.0 Evokes Stanley Kubrick as much as the similarly excellent Under the Skin last year. A must-see for fans of either.
1.0 A masterpiece. Alex Garland puts teeth and a chill into what has either been an empty sci-fi threat, or else has been sentimentalized to death, as in the very bad Chappie.
0.6 Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, it's an enjoyable, grown-up entertainment, even if it leaves us wanting something deeper.
0.8 Despite following a great deal of well-worn territory, the film manages to engage its audience with its icy and efficient delivery and consistent undercurrent of malevolence.
0.9 It's the kind of film that seems to me shy of a masterpiece right now, but one where I may well find it to be with time and repeat viewings.
1.0 "Ex Machina" is an exquisite puzzle box of a picture. It baffles. It unsettles. It intrigues.
1.0 A beautifully-crafted science fiction drama that recalls the ingenuity and brilliance of "Jurassic Park."
0.625 The ideas here don't breathe. They simply take us from one plot point to the next.
0.75 "Ex Machina" isn't quite "Citizen Kane" for an era of Internet tycoons, but it suggests that that's not such a bad idea.
0.875 A singularly chilling cinematic stunner that coexists as a wild daydream and a prescient glimpse into the future.
0.7 A rattling and ruminative piece of speculative fiction, Ex Machina is good enough to wish it were even better.
0.875 Ex Machina addresses heady issues of A.I., exploring what it means to be human or, more important, what it means to be an imitation of humanity so real, what's the actual difference?
0.875 "Ex Machina" is a smart, exceptionally stylish head trip.
0.75 Garland sidles up to some large ideas, some more provocative than others, and his premise hints at the costs of perpetual, omnivorous surveillance.
0.75 It's hard to imagine another director squeezing as many shades and colors from his screenplay as Garland did, and from now on, it would be understandable if he insisted on directing everything he writes.
1.0 Alex Garland brilliantly brings the past into the present with the near-future tale Ex Machina, a stark but dazzling meditation on intelligence, consciousness and morality that discreetly uses special effects in service of story, dialogue and character.
1.0 Merciless, efficient and terrifyingly logical...
0.7 Ex Machina is intelligent science fiction operating at a very high level.
0.8 It will make you look at every other movie about artificial intelligence in a whole new way.
0.625 More tricky than smart.
0.75 In the final analysis, the movie doesn't offer much about the subject that hasn't been previously explored, but the soil is fertile and many ideas germinate.
0.75 Slow paced, but thought provoking science fiction.
0.8 A thrilling work of sci-fi ... a smart and visually alluring film that contemplates chilling questions about where technology is headed and the consequences of playing God.
0.8 Beautifully haunting.
0.8 This is the best, most credible, of the artificial intelligence movies to date. Garland keeps the tension up and the pace moving by tackling many thought-provoking existential issues. I was pleasantly surprised, rewarded, by what I had just seen.
0.65 A chilly yet engrossing drama, elevated beyond its four-people-locked-in-a-house framework by the eerie beauty of the production design and the thoughtful curiosity of Garland's screenplay.
0.8 Ex Machina achieves that rare combination of eliciting both strong thoughts and feelings, and it deserves to be known as a sci-fi classic.
0.75 A TED Talk in the form of a movie, with a few creepy twists and suspenseful deceptions that keep the plot moving forward.
0.875 Gleeson is terrific and Vikander, who stars in five other films this year alone, is a revelation. As is Ex Machina, a movie that looks like something destined to be savored, watched and re-watched endlessly over the years.
1.0 We will be very lucky if we get another movie either as good or better this year.
0.875 Although "Ex Machina" is small and talky - it has just four characters, and the only action comes at the end - it also looks good. The set direction is interesting and evocative. The effects impress but don't overwhelm.
0.8 turns a standard story into something quite special
0.9 It's become far too commonplace to overuse the term 'masterpiece,' but Alex Garland's directorial debut comes about as close as you can get.
0.75 I know, I know. You've seen all this A.I. stuff before. But never like this. Garland is hot for ethical shop talk on what defines humanity or lack of same.
1.0 This is a classic film.
0.6 If any film needed a brief, impromptu hip hop dance scene (Oscar Isaac, predictably, has moves), it's one attempting a treatise on the meaning of existence.
0.7 It makes up for its linearity with verve, first in the impeccably controlled, intellectually rigorous direction, and then in the performances.
0.75 Austere, cerebral and chilling
0.875 For a first-time director, Garland seems assured. His sharp, sparse dialogue and meticulous direction are equally compelling, and the trio of lead performances are top-notch.
0.625 It doesn't quite add up in the end, but it's heady stuff anyway, dense with moments of shivery beauty and frightening ideas.
0.8 An intriguing four-character sci-fi drama about explorers of artificial intelligence.
0.6 "Ex Machina" shows there's still life left in tales of artificial intelligence.
0.875 By going deep on a simple construct, Ex Machina establishes itself as a unique and deeply unsettling psychological thriller that's both necessary and unforgettable.
0.9 With uncommon intelligence and the even more uncommon ability to look without blinking, Garland's made the one of the best sci-fi films of the past several years, a wicked and wise parable of the near-now that's honed to a gleam.
0.9 Wickedly smart and often wickedly funny, this delightfully entertaining science fiction drama is one of the best films of the year.
1.0 Might not be the first film about the dangers inherent in giving robots free will, but it's certainly one of the most accomplished.
0.625 There comes a point where, if we have been paying attention, we know what will happen once a character walks out a door.
0.5 In the end, more than just the machine remains an enigma.
0.9 It's a very smart movie and seems to almost be cognitive of what the audience is thinking ... one of the best pure sci-fi movies to come out in a very long time.
0.75 ...[Ex Machina] never stops being slick, cool, and polished, its intelligence not artificial at all.
0.8 A confident, engrossing debut.
0.9 Compelling, claustrophobic, cutting edge and clever, Ex Machina is as smart and satisfying as science fiction gets.
0.8 An intriguingly stripped-down sci-fi thriller about artificial intelligence that's fully attuned to its more blockbuster elements yet pleasingly cerebral at the same time.
0.8 This is knowingly seductive sci-fi cinema, its slyly subversive allegiances hidden by the two-way mirror of the silver screen, its androids dreaming of much more than mere electric sheep.
0.8 Closer to Caryl Churchill's stage play A Number than to, say, THX-1138, this tight, tense virtual three- hander sings with creative disharmony.
0.8 Cool! It's a trip! All Alex Garland's creations are a trip.
0.8 Garland has produced something seductively strange, consistently thought-provoking and admirably adult.
0.8 Its thought-provoking themes will gnaw at your own humanity long after the shocking finale has bowed.
0.8 Novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland's first film as a director takes some very old ideas and gives them an ingenious new spin.
0.8 Ex Machina is a smart, tricksy study of artificial intelligence and tech-sex that explores a credible near-future take on the man-machine relationship.
0.6 Ex Machina feels like an elegant SF short story with a droll twist that has been pumped up and sexed up into an over-bulky feature film. But it's managed with confidence.
0.8 Smart, swanky, a little inhuman and preternaturally well crafted.
0.8 Slick and seductive, this exploration of artificial intelligence may essentially only have three characters, but it's complex, provocative and thoroughly engaging.
0.8 Stylish, elegant, tense, cerebral, satirical and creepy. Garland's directorial debut is his best work yet, while Vikander's bold performance will short your circuits.
0.6 Feels like a pathway to grander things for Garland.
0.8 The lush setting avoids the stifling grey look of so many other sci-fi films and the commendably-restrained special effects are as outstanding as the three fast-rising lead actors.
0.8 This is bewitchingly smart science fiction of a type that's all too rare. Its intelligence is anything but artificial.
0.8 As thoughtful as it is thrilling, Ex Machina is a razor-sharp and nimble character drama which takes a controlled nosedive into exhilarating sci-fi horror.
0.8 There's no little hint of Kubrick and Hitchcockian paranoia to Alex Garland's debut as writer-director, a nifty, quasi-Gothic three-hander of great performances and unerring control.
0.6 A bit more intelligence would not have gone amiss.
0.8 Ex Machina is smart, sexy and thrilling sci-fi filmmaking at its most fascinating.
1.0 There's a lot going on here. But don't think for a second this is troublesome critic-fodder. It's thrilling.
0.8 A smart, accomplished piece of work that presses all the right buttons.
0.8 Gleeson convinces as a desperate-to-please, ambitious young coder. Isaac's difficult-to-read, drunken, pumped-up mad scientist is disquieting and Vikander excels in a demure and shifting role.
0.8 Garland cleverly keeps us on our toes by constantly toying with our allegiances.
0.9 Anchored by three dazzling central performances, it's a stunning directorial debut from Alex Garland that's essential viewing for anyone with even a passing interest in where technology is taking us.
1.0 Multi-faceted and nuanced, each with so many subtleties and complexities Ex_Machina is a film bursting with ideas.
0.5 As much as I sat amused (occasionally highly amused) for 136 minutes, I never felt particularly engrossed or even all that thrilled. The stakes were too low.
0.6 In the absence of definitive work done in our heroing couple, a pair rich in fibers but relegated to broad strokes and easy quips in this turn, most of it amounts to a fairly good spy thriller, not an ace-in-the-whole neo-superhero masterpiece.
0.8 It has a charismatic hero, inspired action choreography and Robert Redford as a living signifier of the days when Hollywood thrillers tried to make you think about stuff between shootouts. Also, it's really funny.
0.6 Chris Evans is back as Captain America, powered by super-serum and a sense of loss.
0.8 This is the most political, complicated Marvel movie to date.
0.75 The Winter Soldier is all-American entertainment, with a hero enlightened to the fact that while he may not be able to trust his American government's leaders, he ultimately represents not them but the American ideals of truth and justice.
0.8 Sometimes a film leaves you with a big, dumb grin on your face. The Marvel blockbuster Captain America: The Winter Soldier... is such an item.
0.75 I agree that this is an enjoyable film, but if you ask if I'm excited to see a sequel, my honest answer is it wouldn't bother me if they never made another one.
0.8 With Chris Evans charismatic as ever in the lead, and a good supporting cast, The Winter Soldier is a welcome addition to Marvel's ever-expanding canon.
0.8 Winter Soldier has enough intrigue to satisfy fans and a Heat-style street battle cements it as a stand-alone thriller, albeit one which doesn't really reflect how 'winter soldiers' were 1970s' Vietnam veterans concerned about US war crimes.
0.7 What starts as a terrific and grounded little thriller becomes less interesting as it gets less "little".
1.0 The best Marvel film to date explores government overreach, the real and perceived threats to national security and how true American values will always win out over false ones.
0.9 "'The Winter Soldier' not only satisfies with its plentiful action scenes, it also offers some intriguing commentary on the current political and world climate, and turns out to be a sterling character piece."
0.75 ...has a nice push and pull going on, between nostalgia for a time gone by and a piercing, contemporary relevance.
1.0 I salute you, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier.'
0.5 A substantial disappointment after 2011's better-than-expected Captain America: The First Avenger...
0.875 'Winter Soldier' is a layered and paranoid espionage thriller, what you'd get if John le Carre took a stab at the superhero genre.
0.75 A solid example of meat-and-potatoes popcorn filmmaking--befitting that most meat-and-potatoes of comic book heroes.
0.75 Proving his mettle in a story with a darker tone, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an excellent chapter in the Marvel canon.
0.75 The Winter Soldier delivers a funnier, angst-ridden Captain for our security vs. liberty-obsessed times.
0.75 the movie stabs right at the heart of the ultimate virtue for which Captain America stands--freedom--by questioning what exactly such a virtue entails and what is required to preserve it
0.9 May be the most thoughtful instance of character depth in a comic-born action extravaganza.
0.75 I'm afraid of Robert Redford.
0.8 On a fundamental level, the Russos get the character of Captain America, and this deep understanding trickles down into the film in satisfying ways.
0.5 The movie doesn't use any time in establishing an identity, because it is obsessed with the thrill.
0.4 Yet another super-sized serving of superhero cinematic sponge cake... this follow-up really feels like bloated franchise filler.
1.0 A great addition to the Marvel heroes family, (this) is another testament to the powers that be at Marvel Studios know that anything worth doing is worth doing well!
0.75 Chris Evans has grown significantly in his role since The Avengers, and he's far more appealing here, going for the same kind of charming, simple quality that Christopher Reeve had in the Superman movies.
0.6 It's hard to tell the difference between the parody and the parodied in Marvel movies; almost everything comes with a wink until Things Get Serious at the apocalyptic climax.
0.875 The unlikely directors are comedy connoisseurs Anthony and Joe Russo, working with a gargantuan Marvel/Disney support team no doubt organized on the theory that these movies have become Too Big To Fail...
0.875 Most fascinating is watching the cast's two old pros, Jackson and Redford, spark in surprising ways.
0.7 [There's] a great film that could have been made by the same people and much of the same raw material, but commercial forces obliged it to instead be just pretty good.
1.0 Black Widow is the scene stealer this time out... There's just very little than can be said against a film this well-rounded and complete... Trust no one - except Marvel.
0.75 For what it's worth, I'm looking forward to its sequel.
0.86 Yes, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a great action movie -- an immensely enjoyable spy-thriller-flavored film with Bond-worthy flair (and orchestral flourishes). But first and foremost, it's also a great Captain America film.
0.6 Acaba se perdendo na necessidade de incluir elaboradas sequencias de acao e de ser um "filme de super-heroi" em vez de insistir na ideia de ser um filme sobre um humano que tem superpoderes.
0.7 A mission quite accomplished for those hooked on all things Marvel.
0.7 What a ride. It is a real popcorn movie.
0.8 The best thing in the film is, in fact, its take on Captain America that makes it great, as Evans plays Cap as Jimmy Stewart on steroids...
0.8 Miles beyond the great 2011 chapter. Ups the ante in storyline, character development and action, while giving a thrilling setup for future installments. It's the best of the Marvel/Avengers pantheon since The Avengers movie.
0.8 Super Fun, Super Exciting,
0.8 The Russos raise the stakes on each successive action sequence, until they arrive at [a] thundering, brutal, intensely suspenseful climax.
0.7 A brawny blockbuster-formula movie with the brains of an espionage thriller, it recalls vintage '70s spy romps but resonates with contemporary issues.
0.8 If the original is anything to applaud, the sequel usually isn't. And even more rarely is the sequel actually better. But with this near-perfect comeback, we don't see so much of it coming, we enjoy nearly all of it and we can't ask for very much more.
0.7 A spy-centric, timely, intriguing thriller.
0.7 Trust, betrayal and good ole-fashioned right and wrong lie at the heart of Marvel's latest offering.
0.95 Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a mesmerizing superhero film that satisfies on every level. When that last snake head is chopped off, you still find yourself wanting more after 136-minutes of pure comic book superhero cinematic nirvana.
0.875 "Captain America" is a grittier, more dangerous and darker movie than you've come to expect from the features in the Marvel franchise.
0.7 After not helming big-screen offerings for almost nine years (not since "You, Me and Dupree"), Cleveland-reared directors Anthony and Joe Russo throw in a few inspired winks to some stimulating movies from the more politically influenced past.
0.75 It imports so many cast members from The Avengers that it almost feels like the Age of Ultron is already upon us. Yet it's a credit to the scripters that their stage feels crowded but not cluttered, as every character is allowed opportunities to shine.
0.6 As weakling-turned-super-soldier Steve Rogers, Evans remains the best reason to see any movie with Captain America in it.
0.8 It's an enjoyable ride and should be good for keeping the anticipation at bay for next summers' The Avengers sequel.
0.6 The fans won't be disappointed by the lavish visual effects, the explosions and gun battles, all of which are the essential elements in this kind of super-cinema experience.
0.875 Often has something akin to the tone of a 1970s-era paranoid conspiracy thriller. Marrying the slam-bang adventure of a comic book with something more cerebral was a brilliant idea, one that is very entertainingly executed.
0.7 Arguably the studio's best sequel to date - a gripping and socially relevant continuation to its hero's cinematic evolution.
0.8 a super hero adventure grounded in reality that works on both levels, and a genuinely suspenseful story that harks back to the best of the Cold War thrillers
0.8 A timely narrative, deep exploration of fan-favorite characters, and unforgettable action set pieces make Captain America: The Winter Soldier one of Marvel's best.
0.7 The ninth film in the ever-growing Avengers series has a slightly problematic plot, and it provides more comfort than true thrills, but is most certainly a serviceable entertainment.
0.8 "Winter Soldier" is a nod to the great espionage films of the 1970s, movies like "3 Days of the Condor" and "The Parallax View," even going so far to bridge the two by casting "Condor" star Robert Redford as shady politician Alexander Pierce.
0.75 A superior sequel that, at the very least, stands shoulder-to-shoulder with its whizbang predecessor.
0.75 The banter between Chris Evans as Rogers and Scarlett Johansson's Nathasha Romanoff is a welcome antidote to superhero gravitas syndrome.
0.8 The performers ensure all the apocalyptic sparkle feels human. Thanks to their sense of committed purpose in making it personal, Captain America transcends patriotism and hits the universal.
0.75 Beneath its comic-book action trappings, the film is about Captain America's loss of innocence. He's 93 years old, and he comes of age.
0.8 Machinery collides, mega-fighting transpires, exciting car chases and even more exuberant car crashes aim right for your face. It's loud and, lucky you, designed for maximum impact (well, a PG-13 suggestion of impact, anyway; this isn't The Raid 2).
0.625 It takes a Captain America - level super bladder to make it through the film.
0.6 As the film moves into its final act, it gets a little too familiar, even a bit baggy. We're reminded that at its core this franchise of films is just a bunch of aw-shucks fun.
0.8 What's really great about 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is that it feels like its own fully realized movie and not just a bridge to the next superhero extravaganza.
0.875 It wants to be serious, funny, jingoistic, independent-minded, poignant and a CGI fireworks show all at once in every scene. Even Michael Bay has a headache.
0.6 A film that functions just as nicely as a political thriller as it does as an action movie, and which arrives as a big, loud and highly polished dose of popcorn-munching fun.
0.6 If Captain America: The Winter Soldier is indeed an augur of things to come during this special-effects-laden summer, maybe it won't be such a painful season after all.
0.875 This is the first Marvel Studios movie since the original Iron Man that really stands on its own.
0.875 The most contemplative and challenging of the Avengers movies.
0.625 There's too much going on: the Marvel Universe stuff, the WikiLeaks-ish paranoia stuff, the video game-ish CG visual effects stuff, the epic John Woo-ish everybody-pointing-a-weapon-at-everybody-else face-off stuff.
0.7 The Winter Soldier represents the evolution of Captain America into a more complex character. He still kicks major ass and can throw that shield like a death Frisbee, but does he have enough courage to ask out the hot babe that lives next door?
0.35 The conspiracy plays out like the screenwriters read The Huffington Post after The PATRIOT Act but didn't know that TV's "Person of Interest" was already doing this.
0.7 We not only get an edgier, more complex, more compelling storyline, we get the most badass 95-year-old the world has ever known.
0.7 The movie's feel for urban warfare takes its cue, though not its severe, disturbing edge, from street-level spectacles like Heat and Ronin.
0.5 Fans of this franchise should expect more than a boilerplate action flick that brings absolutely nothing new to the genre.
0.875 Among comic-book films, it's up there with Batman Begins and Spider-Man 2 (the first).
0.6 Among Marvel's best.
0.8 A much-improved second outing with a few familiar faces along in his adventure.
0.2 There are too many complicated relationships and back stories of which to keep track.
1.0 Rivals Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight" in complexity and scope in the way it looks at real-world issues through a deceptively simple comic book aesthetic.
0.8 That rarest of movie beasts - a sequel as good as the original.
0.75 This is a sequel that easily surpasses its predecessor by turning its previously dull hero into one with unexpected but logical depth.
0.5 By the time we've been treated to not just one, but two, mid-closing credits scenes that set up future "Avengers" movies, I was wishing they'd concentrate on telling one story capably instead of three or four not very well.
0.75 There's darkness and confusion just under its comic-book surface.
0.75 This film is unlikely to convert a non-Captain America lover into a fanatic but it's assembled with sufficient skill that those who enjoy this sort of motion picture will have a good time.
0.6 I was hoping for something special here.
0.875 The Winter Soldier will reaffirm your faith in big-budget moviemaking that can tell a politically balanced story.
0.75 "The First Avenger" was a work of art, while "The Winter Soldier" is serviceable entertainment.
0.875 A sizzling, stand-alone conspiracy that lights the fuse on the Marvel universe and actually retrofits "Iron Man 2's" clunkiest component parts.
0.75 The best kind of blockbuster comic-book movie, tweaking the brain while dazzling the eye.
0.875 The lack of green-screen laziness makes the red, white and blue workmanship pop out that much more.
0.75 Plot-wise, Winter Soldier makes for a more muscular movie than most Marvel-inspired mysteries.
0.75 His straightforward, human determination made 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger the best of the Avengers origin stories. The Winter Soldier, the best Marvel sequel, shows the guy's still got it.
0.5 "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" has the usual overlong running time, the half-hearted feints in the direction of human feeling and the obligatory action sequences that are big without being either exciting or particularly legible.
0.625 On paper this sequel has some promising elements, but on screen it retreats from the very issues that it raises, and on a shelf next to "Captain America: The First Avenger," "The Winter Soldier" is pale.
0.6 It remains a highlight of Marvel's bid for big-screen dominance, as well as a canny meditation on the perils of overprotective government agencies blithely swapping liberty and freedom for a tenuous sense of safety in a post-9/11 world.
0.75 "The Winter Soldier" is superbly made and well-acted, neatly setting up the next few installments with just the right enticing sense of ongoing mystery.
0.9 With all the superheroes running around here, The Winter Soldier feels like a mini-Avengers movie unto itself.
0.875 "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" is a very good movie, the rare film in this genre that serves as both entry point and continuation. For a change, you can walk in cold and you won't be too lost.
0.75 Powered by a dynamite Evans and a first-rate cast, this movie overcomes its plot holes and 3D too-muchness by making human frailty its primary focus.
1.0 Marvel Studios' answer to 'The Dark Knight' is tremendously entertaining and likely the superhero blockbuster to beat not just for 2014, but possibly many years to come.
0.875 "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" takes a flying leap off the basic premise of superhero movies and sails away in unexpected, crowd-pleasing directions.
0.5 Sometimes the Marvel universe isn't as Marvelous as we've come to expect. Might have been more enjoyable if there had been a compelling story to go along with all the sound and fury, Nick Fury.
0.625 The First Avenger's second outing is a third-rate conspiracy thriller, but Chris Evans and company give it their all.
0.75 For those invested in the Marvel superheroes, it ranks high up there. It's not The Avengers or Iron Man, but it's better than most of the rest of them.
0.9 A fresh Marvel adventure that stands high above its predecessor and even surpasses "The Avengers" in its technique and execution.
0.625 Though Captain America: The Winter Soldier never strays far from preposterousness, the picture's real-world implications give its high-flying action at least a tug of gravity.
0.875 Not only a big action movie, this one is a game-changer in the Marvel saga as well as meditation on what American ideals mean in the modern world.
0.75 The movie does its duty. It's a reliable commodity, delivered efficiently and well, like pizza.
0.75 There is the feeling that the expansive world of this ongoing Marvel saga is no longer spinning its wheels, but headed somewhere potentially fresh and exciting.
0.8 Kudos to the Russos and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for stepping outside the constraints of both the genre and the shared history.
0.75 Fight scenes are tense, though occasionally it's hard to tell who's doing what to whom. But they have the bone-crunching crack of realism sometimes lacking in comic book movies.
0.8 Some of the subterfuge - who's trustworthy and who isn't - is relatively easy to mentally unravel, but thick tension and uncertainty remains the default mode of Captain America: The Winter Soldier.
0.875 In his third outing as the Captain, Evans seems totally comfortable in the role. He manages to convey his character's goodness without making him seem like a self-righteous stiff.
0.7 The most effective standalone Marvel movie since the first Iron Man, and the most consistently entertaining since The Avengers.
0.8 Like Three Days of the Condor and The Bourne Identity jacked up on super serum
0.375 Despite one or two moments of Venture Brothers-worthy fancy, the film is as by-the-numbers as any this series has ever offered.
0.75 It may not offer anything new to the Marvel universe, but like the other films, it's highly entertaining and a lot of fun, making it worth the two-hour investment.
0.8 The people who made Captain America: The Winter Soldier, including the directors Anthony and Joe Russo, understood their calmly uncomplicated hero better than the people who made Man of Steel understood the similarly square Superman.
0.7 The new movie is surprising. It's rambunctious, funny, complex and engaging at the level of ideas.
0.6 Apart from slipping in a Danny Pudi cameo, [directors Anthony and Joe Russo] keep things funny and character driven. They even file gratuitous shout-outs to Marvin Gaye's 'Trouble Man' soundtrack.
0.8 As far as sequels besting original titles go, Captain America: The Winter Soldier makes The First Avenger look like that silly Cap adaptation from 1990.
0.8 A great international thriller, it engages the world at large yet stays focused as a sharp cast led by Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie and Robert Redford support the star-spangled main man.
0.5 Deeply mediocre and ultra-predictable ...
0.625 While ''The Winter Soldier'' succeeds as finely engineered merchandise built to be crowd-pleasing entertainment, for moviegoers and shareholder alike, it has a shelf life that won't last much past its running time.
0.625 While Evans is still great in the role and it's nice that this superhero film is actually "about something," it lacks the heart of "Captain America" and the humor of "The Avengers."
0.8 This is a genuine delight, a smart film without so much of the CG filler these movies can often contain.
0.7 [...] The Winter Soldier smartly integrates a crisply orchestrated Marvel action movie with the paranoid thrillers of the 1970s, which were pegged to a mistrust of government and the shadow organizations that orbit it.
0.875 The movie has many quiet, insightful moments that lend gravity to the situation, as well as some clever fish-out-of-water character definition.
0.875 It advances the story and respects mythos of its comic book creations, yet isn't averse to taking risks and moving it into bolder directions.
0.6 Those in search of eye-popping, cliff-hanging spectacle won't be disappointed, but on a personal level (and post credits sequences aside) Joss Whedon this ain't.
0.8 Captain America: The Winter Soldier sees the talent (rookies or veterans) assembled firing on all cylinders, significantly upping the stake for the next phase of the MCU and showing why we still need "a little old fashioned."
0.6 For the most part, however, The Winter Soldier - though never as agreeably dusty as The First Avenger - tips its shield to older, less digitally engorged schools of suspense cinema.
0.6 The plotting is purposeful and the writing tidy.
0.8 From Scarlett Johansson's wonderfully sultry femme fatale Black Widow to Robert Redford's self-satisfied politician and Samuel L Jackson's tough and sardonic Nick Fury, the film benefits from performances that combine camp with conviction.
0.7 This is the Marvel movie that divides the fans from the casual filmgoers, as the movies become more like a TV series in which the world is saved from disaster every week.
0.6 Marvel fans will be left writhing with pleasure.
0.8 It is an exhilarating ride, expertly overseen by co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo.
0.8 The Marvel faithful will turn up for the action scenes, and the directors, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, add an uncommon sharpness to sequences of urban warfare -- these Heat-grade bullet volleys have a real ping to them.
0.96 This sequel fully displays the exciting power that Marvel's Phase Two is capable of.
0.6 Thanks to Johansson, Jackson and Redford, this is all good fun. It's a shame the weak link is the Captain himself.
0.6 Robert Redford, laying aside Mr Liberal Sundance Nice Guy, lends sleek mischief to a dodgy Washington power-broker. Elsewhere, it's the box-office blend as before.
1.0 The result is a blockbuster with a brain and a superhero movie that feels ripped not from a comic book so much as today's headlines.
0.6 The Winter Soldier is consistently engaging, exciting in bursts, but there's not one point in which the film ever excels.
0.8 It may climax with an overly formulaic splurge, but The Winter Soldier benefits from an old-school-thriller tone that, for its first half at least, distinguishes it from its more obviously superheroic Marvel cousins.
0.4 Chris Evans' welcome return to the superhero fold can't save this sequel from feeling like an awkward franchise mid-point.
0.8 It boasts the best of Marvel's knowing wit and and one-liners, the grandest flex of its big-dollar action muscle, and crucially, some of the boldest plot developments yet seen in its cinematic canon.
0.7 The Winter Soldier (admittedly, the best of a recent batch) feels thoroughly unremarkable. That's what happens when you get too much of a just-okay thing.
0.9 Fundamentally, this is a superhero movie with something to say. In fact it's the first Marvel entry with a truly topical sting.
0.9 Be prepared for a game changer!
0.8 The second Captain America movie is a terrific, stand-alone thriller that delivers exciting action sequences and engaging characters wrapped up in a satisfying and cleverly resonant plot.
0.8 The most interesting Avengers film yet.
0.9 Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not a flawless picture, but its portrayal of heroism comes incredibly close to perfection.
0.75 It chooses to avoid the easy gags and go for stronger drama by having Cap confront something he really wasn't prepared for: A S.H.I.E.L.D. that seems to have lost its way, and may even have a few traitors buried deep inside it.
1.0 The film is everything anyone could want from a comic book movie, and will stand as one of the best of all time.
0.7 A tug-of-war between grit and goof
0.6 Exactly what we expect from Marvel now and, as such, this is the first film in its catalogue that doesn't feel particularly fresh or exciting.
0.9 The ninth installment in the Marvel cinematic universe, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is also perhaps its most intricately crafted.
0.8 With a string of gratifying action sequences, and a breakneck pace leavened by a frequently witty script, The Winter Soldier stands alone as a solidly entertaining blockbuster.
0.6 You can't help but feel disappointment that a film with a relatively spicy premise becomes, in the end, so risk-averse.
0.8 This sequel gives the flagging comic-book movie an adrenaline shot of relevance. You've got to hand it to them.
1.0 To that end, make sure you stay watching through the credits. Captain's orders.
0.8 Despite featuring three Avengers in lead roles, Captain America: The Winter Soldier feels tonally distinct from its Marvel forerunners, more spy thriller than superhero sequel.
0.8 Gains huge points by working as a standalone movie set in the world of espionage and world politics, different enough from previous Marvel movies to be more accessible for non-comic fans than anything Marvel's done thus far.
0.8 This entry won't win any new converts, but anyone already invested in this series is going to have a blast.
0.8 Every element in Captain America: The Winter Soldier from its strong characters, engrossing conspiracy storyline and especially the taut action scenes are brilliantly done.
0.4 Empty but expensive bunch of nothingness + style.
0.71 Seldom boring, yet covers much ground familiar to most viewers.
0.5 Leave it to Disney to pass off the pilot of a made-for-cable series as a straight-to-tape sequel to a theatrical blockbuster.
1.0 Seventy-five years on, it hasn't dated in the slightest.
0.8 The central themes of illusions, dreams and going on an extraordinary adventure all the better to come home and appreciate what you have there are enduring.
1.0 One of Hollywood's quintessential productions, this musical adaptation of L Frank Baum's classic fable is probably the most beloved fantasy film of all time and the ultimate family picture.
1.0 This family classic long ago left the realm of being mere entertainment to emerge as a cultural touchstone for generations of Americans.
1.0 The Wizard of Oz is the cinematic equivalent of high-end wine, in that it gets better with age. The difference is that while wine must remain unopened to increase in value, the film positively thrives on it being tasted and shared over and over and over.
0.95 MGM's fantastic IMAX 3D conversion for the The Wizard of Oz's 75th anniversary underlines rather than obscures most of the film's visual pleasures, reminding us (if we'd managed to forget) just how glorious L. Frank Baum's strange world is.
0.875 The blend of old-fashioned, classic storytelling with cutting-edge technology is undeniably enthralling.
1.0 Hey, Dorothy actually has freckles in IMAX. Glinda's floating sphere is mesmerizing. The flying monkeys are creepier than ever. The Lollipop Guild even more disturbing - are these guys having a seizure?
1.0 Any reason to show your children "The Wizard of Oz" on a big screen seems like a good one.
1.0 The best thing about 3D glasses is that they keep your kids from seeing your tears of sentimental joy at this gorgeous restoration
1.0 This phantasmagorical fantasy really does represent old-school MGM filmmaking at its best.
1.0 It is one of the greatest movies ever made, and even today it stands the test of time as a quality family flick.
1.0 Even decades later, one of the best family films ever made.
1.0 A head trip of a family film.
1.0 The moment Judy Garland starts singing in that barnyard, we're all six years old again, with nothing left to do but join her.
1.0 It's more than a movie; it's an American rite of passage. [Blu-ray]
1.0 If through some incredible chance you haven't [seen it], all I can say is: do so immediately. Make this the very next movie you watch. Literally.
1.0 One of only a handful of films that nearly everyone is familiar with.
1.0 The songs and magic are still fresh, even if it isn't quite knowing enough, perhaps, for today's young audiences.
1.0 The greatest children's movie of all time. Probably.
1.0 This 3D remastering of the original, on a giant Imax screen to boot, brings a whole new sense of wonder to Dorothy's yellow-brick road movie.
1.0 I'll see you on the dark side of the moon...and your little dog, too!
1.0 It's a movie that speaks of Hollywood's unacknowledged fascination with the exotic, the mad, the unreal.
0.9 ...a thoroughly American fairy tale that wholly endorses the ethic of consumerism.
1.0 One of the greatest films made ... in any genre.
1.0 It's a movie almost everyone has seen multiple times, and every viewing is a visit home as well as a wild adventure toward territories unknown.
1.0 ...one of the most enduring musical fantasies of all time.
0.75 A true amalgam of creative forces individually pooling their studio-contract talents like a hive of bees (in tribute to a trio of queens...a quartet if you count George Cukor).
1.0 Well named "the wonderful Wizard of Oz"!
1.0 The film is probably as entertaining now as it was in 1939.
1.0 Still a treat for you -- and your little dog too...
0.8 A delightful fantasy for children and adults alike, one that cherishes childhood and its dreams.
1.0 The greatest movie ever? It certainly comes close to claiming that title
1.0 No need to say that this film is a classic.
0.8 It never was a great film, but it's now a part of our culture.
1.0 Pink Floyd anyone?
1.0 I think everyone agrees it is a legendary film and everyone who hasn't seen it, should.
1.0 Is there another family movie as timeless as this one? I don't think so, pal.
1.0 This movie is an ideal family film, superb in every aspect, with outstanding art direction, music, and performances.
1.0 Each time it is shown, this extraordinary film ... embraces a new generation of children who succumb to its magic.
1.0 Its underlying story penetrates straight to the deepest insecurities of childhood, stirs them and then reassures them.
0.9 I can't imagine my childhood without this movie.
0.91 Each scene in The Wizard of Oz is spectacular in its visual creativity. Each song is inspired.
1.0 Remarkable, colorful, heartwarming.
1.0 A dazzling fantasy musical so beautifully directed and acted that it deserves its classic status.
1.0 The music is so infectiously happy that it is basically impossible to keep your toes from tapping, your head from bobbing, and an ear-to-ear grin from appearing on your face.
1.0 This wonderful romp of a movie looks magical on the big screen: colors are a picnic for the eyes, details loom so clearly you can practically touch them and there's a sense of the larger-than-life with a film that's already larger than life.
1.0 It's not simply a magical, whirling experience, but a ground breaker for visual and technological creativity, combining Hollywood forces with Hollywood genius to spawn strands of unique and original elements never before attempted at the movies.
1.0 The Wizard of Oz is one of those rare classics that can endure for generations and be as popular to adults as it is to kids.
1.0 the message comes across loud and clear that you don't have to have a boat, a car or a plane to make a journey of self-discovery and that courage, intelligence and compassion come from within, not through medals, diplomas or testimonials.
1.0 Every bit THE classic.
1.0 Seeing The Wizard of Oz in a movie theater, the way God and Louis B. Mayer intended you to see it, is like being at Cape Canaveral for a space shuttle launch instead of watching it on television.
0.5 Rather than a wolf in sheep's clothing, Teen Wolf is basically a standard 80s teen flick in werewolf's clothing.
0.7 It's often ridiculous, and filled with '80s cheese, but Teen Wolf does harbor some poignant coming-of-age metaphors and decent helping of intentional, and unintentional, comedy.
0.6 corny but endearing
0.4 Classic 80s teen flick. Ow-wooo!
0.0 Forgettable formulaic comedy.
0.6 Lots of fun. Michael J.Fox is hilarious!
0.2 You have to give Contaminated Man credit for laying its cards on the table: as you might have guessed from the title, it is indeed about a contaminated man.
1.0 one of the best remakes ever
0.6 It was always going to be hard to better Don Siegel's 1956 classic, and if director Philip Kaufman doesn't quite succeed, he does manage to summon up an equally chilling air of paranoia.
0.875 This terrific remake never lets the audience forget that it should be frightened.
0.9 Very entertaining, and despite the by now over familiar-plot, pleasantly suspenseful.
1.0 one of the great sci-fi horrorshows, a movie that gooses you with its premise, makes you laugh and jump, and ultimately leaves you with something you can't quite shake
0.8 On top of being an engrossing conspiracy thriller in step with the gritty urban tales of the time, the Invasion of the Body Snatchers is also a genuinely creepy film which slyly suggests there is something sinister beneath the surface.
0.9 If not quite as great as its predecessor, still a pretty damn fine genre picture.
1.0 A superior sci-fi thriller that makes even raindrops, plants and electrical cords take on sinister life.
0.625 The film collapses midway -- because of unsure and sloppy direction, splintered story continuity, and the overacting of Adams, Cartwright, and others.
0.8 Not as terrifying as the original, but still a shocker.
0.875 A cerebral and suspenseful film of foreboding atmosphere. On a short list of truly outstanding remakes.
0.8 utterly chilling
0.6 Scary at the time, campy fun now
0.8 Inspired remake of 1950s classic
0.8 Good remake of the 1956 film with direction that bogs in superfluous touches.
0.8 Ending still freaks me out. I'm serious, even twenty-five years later. Stop laughing at me.
1.0 This will read less like a review and more like a valentine, but this is a very, very special film, a forgotten classic of the '70s cinema.
0.8 The dog with a human head rocks!
0.91 ...what if the mask of your neighbor tilts for a second and you catch a glimpse of the riot going on behind his face?
0.6 Deve ser encarado como aquilo que realmente e: um terrorzinho-ficcao cientifica descomprometido com a logica e preocupado em manter o publico acordado por 2 horas.
1.0 The screenplay by W.D. Richter builds at a deliberate pace, and within the first half hour we're already disturbed by the almost imperceptible behavior of those who have been snatched.
0.8 [Kaufman] weaves an increasingly sinister cityscape through prowling camerawork and a highly effective stereo score.
0.875 Personally I think this version to be superior to the original and to be much underrated by both critics and audiences.
0.8 For once, a great remake, smartly executed. Great performances and a killing ending that will stay with you forever can't hurt, either.
0.8 Donkey, with his endless asides and phenomenally thick skin, is as much of a pleasure as he was in the first film, but he has a challenger: Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas.
0.6 There's no denying that Shrek 2 is fun, but it's fun without substance, and like the bubbles in the Fairy Godmother's potions, it evaporates quickly.
0.875 It's a close call as to which one's better.
0.875 It's not often that a sequel is richer and deeper than the original creation, especially when we're talking about the offerings of Hollywood. But Shrek 2 is the exception.
0.8 The characters are still charming, the animation really is spectacularly smooth and expressive, and the Looney Tunes-style humor and pop-culture in-jokes are as inventive and hilarious as before.
1.0 Shrek 2 is as much of a shriek as the original and if they keep putting out films as charming as this one, we'll all live happily ever after.
0.7 Shrek 2 retains all the fun, artistry and pop stylings of Shrek.
0.8 Shrek 2 does not feel like a sequel. It's very funny, very fresh, and leaves one anxious for the next installment.
0.875 If fall movies were this consistently clever, there would never be reason to hesitate before plunking down hard-earned bucks at the multiplex.
0.8 There's plenty of subtle satire and double entendres for young and old alike to savour.
1.0 Just as much fairytale fun as the first one.
0.875 One couldn't ask for a better sequel than Shrek 2.
0.8 All the cast are uniformly excellent in their roles.
0.6 While Shrek 2 bowls merrily along on the fuel of firecracker wit and knowing pastiche that made the original so memorable, it will come as no surprise that second time around we don't feel quite so discombobulated by its brilliance.
0.4 The most accurate way to sum up Shrek 2 is that it is exactly like the original.
0.8 You'll be laughing from the first five minutes.
0.875 It ends up not so much an extension of Shrek's story as an improved retelling. [It's] critique applies to any culture that has codes of behavior and appearance.
0.7 Oh, Antonio; as a human you are -- forgive me -- less than convincing, but as a marmalade pussycat in shiny black thigh-high boots you are absolutely sensational.
0.8 Great amusement, spectacular visuals, and a wholesome story everyone can enjoy.
0.875 a familiar, but funny story of matrimonial turbulence and interfamilial discord ... with a few twisted fairy tale twists, of course
1.0 'Perfecto ejemplo del cine del nuevo milenio, asi como uno de los logros mas importantes en la historia del celuloide. Es, simple y sencillamente, genial e inolvidable.'
0.56 At best, hit and miss comedy.
0.6 An enjoyable if not especially imaginative sequel.
0.8 Enjoyable sequel that reigns in the satirical bite of the original but still delivers plenty of laughs.
0.8 Gauged simply as a gag fest, this is a jolly rib tickle from start to big finish for anyone between six and death. However, it is stretched thinly in development of plot and character.
0.75 Twice as irreverent, twice as flatulent and, at times, twice as much fun as the original.
0.5 Shrek has become a shill, peddling everything from breakfast cereal to M&M's. But is the ready-made blockbuster to the original really all that or just more of the same?
0.9 La trama es sencilla pero explosiva, dando pauta a que los mas ligeros acontecimientos puedan arrebatarnos sonrisas de irreverencia.
0.8 Contando uma historia engracada e interessante, o longa continua a tratar as fabulas com irreverencia.
0.4 Fe Fi Ho Hum!
0.75 The first film had an innocence that made the story feel more real and topical. "Shrek 2" feels very fantastic and improbable.
0.8 Shrek 2 is a smorgasbord of delights, with something for all ages.
1.0 With a witty premise, an all-star cast and a show-stopping rendition of Holding Out For a Hero as the new movie anthem, what's not to love?
0.5 In the best Hollywood tradition, Shrek 2 boldly argues against a prejudice nobody actually has.
0.7 If Antonio Banderas would have played Zorro more like Puss 'n Boots, that movie might have been a lot better.
0.8 A lovelier movie than the first, but...not quite as magical.
0.875 ....thoughtful, extensive, focused and energetic without actually being a retread of the past
0.8 While it's not terribly original--it never takes the premise or characters anywhere new--you'll be so busy laughing you won't care.
0.875 Filled with silly gags and pop culture references, this is a fast-paced gem of a movie that will leave you grinning from ear to ear.
0.9 ...it is a rewarding experience just to play "spot the hilarious movie reference" even if you don't care about the exploits of Shrek et al. But you do care.
0.6 Antonio for Best Supporting Actor! Puss in Boots is the best reason to see a film this summer.
1.0 The sequel may lack the surprise of the original, but it more than makes up for it in terms of the speed -- and volume -- of pop-culture riffs hitting the screen.
0.875 The Shrek gang is back and the new film is better than ever.
0.84 Retains the best of the original - funny characters, smart dialogue, sharp wit and a sweet moral - with less of the obnoxious aspects, and an hilarious new character.
0.75 The humor is so satisfying in its moment-to-moment pleasures that it's almost unsportsmanlike to criticize the bigger picture.
0.7 Serves up heaping helpings of everything fans loved about the first.
0.4 Anyone wanting to see well-crafted animated films that don't rely exclusively on making fun of pre-existing material for their jokes should stick with Pixar.
0.8 With its Meet the Parents vibe and its twisted take on classic fairy tale standards, Shrek 2 is always entertaining and often hilarious.
0.8 I haven't left a theatre with this kind of smile on my face since Elf.
0.8 The long list of sequels to be released in coming months will have a hard time measuring up to this green giant.
0.6 There is distinctly less magic and fun in SHREK 2 as the title ogre has problems becoming accepted by his in-laws.
0.75 The Oscar-winning ogre is back for another adventure, and thankfully the folks behind this one haven't forgotten what made the first Shrek such an entertaining flick.
0.9 There's much fun in one more romp in the company of the monster with a heart of green-gold.
0.6 Is it the second coming of DreamWorks? No, just the second coming of Shrek, which, frankly, is good enough for me.
0.9 Shrek 2 is a fun film that the whole family can enjoy. I think the adults may enjoy it even more than the kids.
0.75 Often very amusing, thanks to a droll script by co-director and co-writer Andrew Adamson (Shrek) and others and a terrific roster of supporting players.
0.8 I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the first film and anyone who enjoys fun, fluffy, all-around entertaining animated movies altogether.
0.8 The depiction of what is essentially a mixed marriage has more tender nuances than many 'serious' films that confront the topic outright.
0.5 Apart from Antonio Banderas' sizzling bout of self-parody as Puss in Boots, who boasts a slashing trademark and Latin bravado akin to Zorro's, Shrek 2 is mostly just dreck squared.
1.0 One viewing isn&#8217;t enough. There&#8217;s layer upon layer of visual gags, and in many cases, they&#8217;re funnier than those in the dialogue.
0.6 It's comfortable, easy and warm, and if it leaves you with a slight feeling of deja vu at the end, what else did you expect?
0.75 Cute, cute, cute is pretty much the defining description of Shrek 2.
0.7 Less magical and falls short of the 2001 Oscar-winning hit -- but that still leaves plenty of room for the new film to entertain.
0.7 There's a lot more to Shrek 2 than this 'I'm-okay- you're-okay' idealism, namely non-stop jokes that are clever, surreal and good-natured.
0.625 There is a fine line between name-dropping a product or TV show for laughs and genuinely writing something that is funny on its own merit
1.0 Once or twice a decade, a moment comes along that's so through-the-roof, rupture-your-hernia funny that it reaffirms my faith in comedy. 'Shrek 2' has several of those.
0.875 Shrek 2 serves up a heapin' helping of merriment and mayhem within a spectacular concoction of animated brilliance! READ ON->
1.0 C'est simple: si vous avez aime Shrek, vous adorerez Shrek 2.
1.0 Shrek 2" proves a sequel not only can be good - but can be great.
0.75 At its best, this Shrek sequel draws up a brilliant new blueprint for all-ages animation, blending fairy-tale whimsy with edgy social satire.
1.0 Fairytales like this can come true... for me and for you.
0.625 Clearly, it's a problem when a movie's least interesting characters are its title hero and his signficant ogre...
0.875 Still flashy, funny and irreverent, balanced with a keen understanding of its lead characters that makes it more than just franchised eye-candy.
0.875 ...the villain this time around is Fairy Godmother herself, who acts like a magically powered plastic surgeon.
0.7 Manages to be a lot of fun while still playing it safe.
0.875 What's amazingly gutsy about Shrek 2 is its ability to dare to duplicate the infectious wit of its Academy-Award winning predecessor
0.5 None of the jokes stand on their own as jokes; they depend on the usual boys' bathroom humor and on pop culture references that range from a bit outdated to very outdated.
0.75 Getting to spend more time with these guys is a treat, but ultimately this is a mostly unnecessary sequel.
0.625 Somebody warn Ellen Degeneres that her brief reign as best supporting cartoon voice is now in jeopardy.
0.75 Lively and fun.
0.875 It's sharp, funny and has a twisted sensibility that manages to be just right for every age group.
0.75 Every bit the equal of the first film.
0.875 Delivers more fun than there is slime in a green ogre's swamp.
0.7 Funny and forgettable.
0.8 Offers twice the fun, twice the pop references and double the amount of astonishing technical wizardry of its predecessor.
0.875 The Shrek franchise is alive and well -- Model 2 is zippier, sleeker, with ever-improving graphics, vast commercial potential and the same sly ability to reach out and hook the whole family.
0.4 Gags that feel tired, too many musical interludes, a story that doesn't really progress from the first film -- Shrek 2 feels a day late and an enchanted princess short.
1.0 It's even more clever than the first Shrek, with even more advanced animation, and a larger cast that is equal to the original winning trinity of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz.
1.0 This fractured, very showbizzy deconstruction of fairy tales is in many ways the Godfather: Part II of animations -- it tops its successful predecessor.
0.5 The animation is still startlingly good and that, as well as the occasional bursts of wit, keeps Shrek 2 afloat.
0.75 The sequel to the 2001 computer-animated hit is just as fast, funny and smart as fans were hoping it would be.
0.625 The thrill isn't quite gone, but almost.
0.875 One of the all-too-rare movie sequels that's better than the original.
0.875 It may not be great art, but it's funny stuff for all ages -- and that's a rare treat.
0.875 Shrek 2 proves that winning writing trumps scenery chewing any day.
0.625 A welcome return, even if it won't leave you entirely happy ever after.
1.0 For many people, especially adults, Shrek 2 will be judged the superior of the two pictures.
0.75 A frenetic and very enjoyable 93 minutes at the movies for child and parent alike.
0.875 Kids will enjoy this fast and funny comedy, but the parents will get more of the jokes.
0.875 Shrek would tell Kermit to shove it. Sure, it's easy being green.
0.6 Desperately pleading for our laughs, Shrek 2 offers a small dose of the original's fun spirit with none of its heart.
0.6 Shrek 2 is by no means a bad film. Far from it. However, claims that it's better than the original are wildly overblown...
0.75 Not as funny as the first film, but the story is richer, more emotionally complex and better written.
0.75 A respectable effort and a solid example of family-friendly entertainment.
0.8 Shrek 2 will charm audiences much like the original.
0.95 Antonio Banderas and the Dreamworks animators have teamed up to create a great character, Puss-in-Boots. Cat 'people' will love this!
0.9 A sequel that is every bit as delightful as the original... You might not live happily ever after, but you certainly will live happily for 93 minutes.
1.0 Move over "Godfather 2", "Shrek 2" is the new king of sequels
0.75 With more of an epilogue than a sequel, Dreamworks manages to squeeze a few more drops of humor out of William Steig's beloved ogre.
1.0 Funnier than the original.
0.8 The first Shrek film was an instant classic, and while Shrek 2 may not be at that same level, it isn't far off.
0.875 The big green guy's still got it!
0.7 if not a necessary sequel, certainly a welcome one
0.9 Shrek 2 is smart and silly and exceedingly beautiful to look at; it has a romantic heart and a self-deprecating wink...plus it's just plain old funny!
1.0 Shrek 2 absolutely lives up to the original in every way. It's just as sweet, just as heartfelt, and just as hilarious.
0.75 In a movie filled with imaginative bits, [Puss In Boots] emerges as the cat's meow.
0.875 Shrek 2 is exactly what we want in our sequels; respect for its origins, growth in the characters and an honest attempt to replicate its laugh quotient.
0.9 The writers bombard Puss-in-Boots with cat jokes, and I just couldn't stop laughing every time he was on the screen.
0.75 Shrek 2 may not be as fresh and new as the original, but you still can't stop yourself from lovin' the big green ogre anyway.
0.875 The spirit that made the first film such a charmer survives intact.
0.875 Shrek 2 brims with perverse pleasures that show no respect for the rules of kiddie-cartoon form.
0.875 A sequel as exhilarating and riotously funny as 2001's top-grossing original.
0.75 Not quite as sparkling as the first, but it gets nuttier as it goes along.
0.875 So gorgeously animated and so thoroughly entertaining for all ages that only an ogre would complain it's not quite as fresh as the original.
0.75 This sequel is above average in terms of energy, cleverness and production values. But the original computer-animated blockbuster was so far off the scale that it's hardly fair to expect this one to measure up.
0.75 A solid if not groundbreaking yarn.
0.75 Shrek 2 is bright, lively and entertaining, but it's no Shrek.
1.0 As funny, sweet and engaging as the first film.
0.5 Predicated entirely on "Three's Company"-quality contrivances, requiring all the characters to behave like jackasses in order for the plot to advance.
0.875 This is joyous filmmaking, proof that not all fairy tales have to end.
1.0 I predict this raucously funny, deliciously irreverent comedy will outdraw, outperform and outlast the competition this summer. The ogre rules!
0.8 With delightful new characters, Shrek 2 is the compleat family comedy about being happy in one's own skin -- just what we need in a country obsessed with extreme makeovers.
0.875 ...the sequel has come close to rivaling the original and you will leave ready to see it all again. I don't imagine I'll be writing that compliment often this summer.
0.875 Lampoons a number of fairy-tale conventions but engages in the conflict and warmth of un-enchanted humanity.
0.75 Blazes across the screen with mature, rapid-fire wit; genuine warmth; and rainbow-colored visual beauty.
0.375 DreamWorks, the supposed anti-Disney, is producing product the unfortunate equal of their archenemy.
0.875 Another don't-miss gem from DreamWorks.
1.0 Shrek 2 is one of the great movies of all time.
0.875 The film is amusing from start to finish, but one pseudo-video-taped segment of "KNIGHTS" (a "COPS" spoof) rocks the theater. It's hands down (or handcuffed) hilarious.
0.6 Parfaits are in order for viewing this sequel that stumbles badly before hitting its stride halfway through its running time
0.25 Credit Shrek 2 for being the rare sequel that more or less equals its predecessor-the first film was garbage, and so is the second.
0.5 Rushed, confused, and wildly uneven.
0.65 Doesn't have the gritty feel of 'Terminator' or the sleek cutting edge of technology look of 'Judgment Day,' but it's a decent addition to the Terminator mythos.
0.3 There are bad sequels that still work as movies, basically. T3 doesn't even do that: it isn't a good action film, and isn't a good science fiction film.
0.8 Basically one long, exciting chase scene.
0.75 With splashy digital effects and punchy stuntwork, the solid T3 slides along enjoyably, but doesn't have the impeccable story and visual design of the previous entry.
0.68 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is without a doubt the weakest entry in an otherwise beloved trilogy, but let's be honest, T3 was doomed from the very day franchise creator James Cameron decided to pass on it.
0.4 T3 has the sour, depressive vibe of an untested director submitting to a predetermined mythology not his own.
0.75 That Rise of The Machines is a genuinely good, thoughtful action flick has to register as a surprise...
0.625 The Terminator franchise has developed to the point where simple genre pleasures just aren't enough.
0.5 '... T3 [is] a tease, and not a very good one at that.'
0.75 Until the gutsy ending, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much of a reason for this movie to have been made. And damn if it&#8217;s not fun to watch.
0.6 Maybe it's time to terminate the series for good.
0.7 ...entertaining for the moment, exciting, even exhilarating in parts, but ultimately it's an empty exercise in fuss and bother that leaves one strangely dissatisfied.
0.75 'Mostow logra una cinta llena de accion, con buenos efectos especiales que no decepciona ni al mas clavado fanatico de la franquicia.'
0.85 Easily the most satisfying action film of a year overloaded with disappointing sequels.
0.7 Mostow makes the movie zip, and just because it isn't Deep Thoughts doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable.
0.25 What sickness in the filmmakers inspired them to go ahead and make this TV movie sludge instead of doing some kind of stab at creating the feel of a "Terminator" film?
0.8 It's just darn good fun to see Arnie back in action.
0.6 Em retrospecto, acaba prejudicando seus antecessores.
0.875 It left me feeling giddy like a kid at a carnival.
0.6 It's a slick, smooth and indeed explosive instalment, but it has neither the spit and polish of T2 nor the grittiness of the cult hit T1.
0.875 ...Cameron set an incredibly high standard for this series, and Mostow has to be commended for staying true to the themes and ideas established in the first two flicks...
0.75 Jonathan Mostow's T3 is a spectacular addition to the franchise.
0.4 A chaotic mess, saddled with its own utter meaninglessness and afflicted by the need to be bigger-better-faster-more.
0.9 Sporting sequences that make the Matrix Reloaded and Hulk feel like Sunday morning cheesefest cartoons, it's a blockbuster that'll leave you begging for more
0.8 A worthwhile return to the saga, but more importantly, it's just darn good fun to see Arnie back in action.
0.875 When you leave the theater, you'll be pumped full of adrenaline without a hint of the buyer's remorse that you've felt so often this summer.
0.625 A skillful but spiritless thrill machine, T3 makes a good case for why James Cameron and company perhaps didn't envision a trilogy.
0.6 I can't say it made me anxious for another sequel. Pragmatically speaking, however, a T4 might serve to keep Arnold on the screen and out of politics. Now, there's something to be said for that.
0.8 Highly superfluous, but equally entertaining. Terminator fans, we got lucky with this one - I doubt we'll be so fortunate when the aging Arnold eventually creaks his way through T4: HIP REPLACEMENT DAY
0.625 However - as good as the effects and stunts are - "T-3" is lacking a really great story line to balance out the film.
0.6 Now, The Terminator is a Governor I could rally around!
0.75 ... satisfying.
0.8 I don't know if the film's relentless violence and gore will help Schwarzenegger's nascent campaign for governor of California, but all the action should please the many Terminator fans.
0.75 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines tells the simple yet compelling story of a very old piece of equipment that refuses to go away. Its name is Arnold Schwarzenegger, and, as famously promised, he's back, and at his anticharismatic best, too.
0.875 In the action department, James Cameron is a God. So save for a few choice fanatics, Jonathan Mostow could then be Jesus.
0.6 A lean, efficient, amusing action picture, T3 isn't a patch on its predecessors, but delivers polished genre entertainment nonetheless.
0.9 Terminator 3 has guts.
0.5 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines unfolds as a thrilling piece of entertainment, but it has a third act and ending that don't work and shouldn't ever work.
0.875 In terms of summer movie action, Terminator 3 kicks The Matrix Reloaded's ***.
0.875 Among the minefield of paradoxes and contradictions in 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,' one strikes with deadly accuracy: This is a summer sequel Stanley Kubrick would have loved.
0.75 The sequel expands on the nature of fate that the previous pictures explored so well, culminating in a rather bold third act where saving the day takes on a more unconventional meaning.
0.8 Un vrai film d'ete, efficace et divertissant.
0.7 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines overhauls the original straight-faced tone of the series and tries hard to deliver the granddaddy of popcorn films.
0.6 A strong cast and new director Jonathan Mostow's chaotic sense of action keep this hard-to-terminate saga moving forward with at least a few of the old guns blazing.
0.5 A well-made but empty spectacle that is missing dread, thrills, and, most importantly, variation.
0.7 there's more that works here, than doesn't. Arnie, The script, the cast, the pulsating music score, the direction....there's a lot to be proud of.
0.5 A sizable quotient of the movie's target audience just wants to see stuff destroyed, and in that regard Rise of the Machines won't disappoint.
0.8 Blatantly opportunistic sequel has plot holes, logic problems, minimal innovation ... and a fistful of block-rockin' action.
0.75 This juiced-up futuristic fable is delightfully on maximum overdrive and Arnold S. does what he does best-deliver his brand of robotic ribaldry with the precision of an extremely well-oiled machine.
0.375 "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" might be considered just as damaging to Arnold Schwarzenegger's impending political career as Watergate was for Nixon's.
0.9 A big fun love letter to the first two movies, and worth the wait. But I am a sucker for the Terminator.
0.75 Terminator 3 breaks the third-strike mold thanks to a pair of talented young actors, high-octane action sequences and an aging Austrian who can still hold his own.
0.75 ...a sturdy, reliable entry in the Arnold Schwarzenegger science-fiction series -- a lot like the stomping cyborg the star plays.
0.75 It's a sick kick to watch der Arnold battle a Swiss Army knife shaped like a Maxim cover girl.
0.67 What you make of it depends pretty much entirely on whether or not you can deal with a movie as lopsidedly one-dimensional as this one.
0.75 Arnold is at the top of his game in Terminator 3.
0.75 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines may lack the mythic pow of the 1984 original and the visionary thrill of T2, but it's a potent popcorn movie that digs in its hooks and doesn't let go until an ending that ODs on apocalyptic hoo-ha.
1.0 The coolest summer blockbuster you could wish for!
0.75 ... the newest installment of "The Terminator" aims at nothing less than propelling the franchise in a new direction... better than the original "Terminator" in everything but concept.
0.5 The only real novelty this time is the gender twist added to the central conflict, with a male hero menaced by a female android.
1.0 Terminator 3; Rise of the Machines is friggin' awesome!
0.625 Mostow's done a competent job; but before you get all excited, let's not confuse the word "Competent" with the words "Complex," "Credible," or even "Complete."
0.5 T3 is like an epic from days gone by - they should prop up Arnold on a giant Sphinx next to Elizabeth Taylor and roll them through ancient Egypt together.
0.75 Hey, he SAID he'd be baaahck.
0.75 Unlike the first two movies, this one doesn't bear the directorial mark of James Cameron, but it still manages to deliver heart-pounding suspense and dark science-fiction vision of a world destroyed.
0.5 There's a flat feeling about this effort that's unmistakable and inescapable.
0.75 Director Jonathan Mostow doesn't try to incorporate the high-wire special effects now in vogue, and T3's impressive gravity-bound set pieces seem refreshingly rooted in reality.
0.875 A smashing example of bravura filmmaking.
0.7 This is the filmed equivalent of fan fiction -- consistently mindful of a mythos from which it dares not deviate.
0.75 If Rise of the Machines never feels as essential as the first two movies, it doesn't feel like a rip-off, either.
0.625 T3 is easily the loudest film ever made. It's also the best $175 million B-movie in history, a distinction that rings as hollow as you might expect.
0.75 In the end this third entry leaves you thinking. And a little disturbed.
0.625 A pretty decent thrill ride.
0.625 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines achieves neither the cult tang of the original nor the spectacular melding of FX to a gripping story that T2 did so well.
0.5 Terminator 3 does a reasonable job of generating suspense from time to time, but the emotional involvement does not reach nearly the same level as the previous films.
0.625 What is missing from Terminator 3 is the relentless inventiveness Cameron brought to the first two Terminator films.
0.4 Maybe they should've sent a robot back in time to force Cameron and company to direct this film.
0.625 T3 should satisfy most action junkies. The various chases, explosions and wrecks are a paean to the efforts of the stunt and effects personnel.
0.875 Endlessly riveting, bolstered with comic relief but by no means perfect.
0.875 Jonathan Mostow stays true to the '80s popcorn actioner opus here both in storytelling and style, yet his updated special effects add a subtly modern element to the pic.
0.4 What starts as familiarity in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines quickly becomes diminishing returns.
0.7 This doesn't make a lot of sense, but who needs plot continuity when there's Claire Danes?
0.4 They made a clone, but left behind the soul -- T3 is T2 without the heart, spirit, and humanity.
0.8 What has always made the Terminator movies stand out from other sci-fi/action flicks is the human drama and the fight against one's fate.
0.7 Certainly of a higher caliber than many of the assembly-line sequels we're often presented with but clearly missing that technological awe that came with Ts 1 and 2.
0.8 He said he'd be back and he is, with a bang, in another sequel that pays tribute to the first two films while delivering enough dazzling action sequences and droll wit to satisfy even the most demanding fans.
0.875 T3 director Jonathan Mostow delivers a high-energy barrage of special effects gee-wizardry that self-effacingly mimics Cameron's style.
0.5 There are spectacular car chases and countless firefights, but they feel perfunctory, predictable and devoid of context.
0.8 An expertly paced and efficient sci-fi thrill machine, 'T3' effectively marries impressive action sequences with persuasive storytelling and its star's uniquely appealing style of 'No' drama -- as in no reaction, no expression, no emotion of any kind.
0.75 I went into the screening not exactly looking forward to the idea of a "T3" and emerged two hours later eager for a "T4".
0.625 Essentially one long chase and fight, punctuated by comic, campy or simplistic dialogue.
0.6 Director Jonathan Moscow and screenwriters John Brancato and Michael Ferris pack the film with muscular action sequences, but the human factor provided by Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor is sorely missed.
0.6 T3 is easily the funniest of the three films, no small achievement when you have Ah-nold playing a cyborg who cracks wise like Joe Clark at a celebrity roast.
0.875 A summer behemoth that actually lives up to its potential.
0.625 Holds our interest but lacks the punch of its predecessors.
0.5 T3 isn't so much a sequel as it is a spoof.
0.625 Terminator 3 moves at not-quite-breakneck speed, and the shape-shifting, metal-melting special effects aren't exactly spectacular.
0.625 Several significant plot holes prove a frustrating and unnecessary distraction from (this) exhilarating, ante-upping...otherwise worthy series-fulfilling successor...
0.625 The pleasures of this text reside almost completely in the sensation that we're watching an extremely well-funded kid playing with toy cars and action figures in a toy city.
0.6 Like the latest Matrix, this is a movie too wrapped up in explosions and fights and chases to say anything coherent.
0.5 T3 is so petrified by its predecessors' conventions that it moves a little like the Terminator himself, with monstrous rigidity and stiff-legged deliberation.
0.75 Writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris turn what could have been an exploitative knock-off into a saga's logical progression.
0.4 Terminator 3 is essentially a B movie, content to be loud, dumb and obvious.
0.25 Terminator 2 wrapped things up so thoroughly and in such a satisfying way that all this witless, plodding rehash can do is tell the same story again, a lot less skillfully.
0.875 The popcorn movie of summer '03.
0.75 Terminator 3 is the summer movie of 2003 that hard-core action fans have been awaiting.
0.8 Rise of the Machines works not just as a strong, credible sequel to one of the best sci-fi franchises but as a great popcorn movie on its own.
0.75 T3 is not just a rare example of a worthy sequel to a sequel, it's a rare example of a worthy summer movie, one that does its job above and beyond the fast-food call of duty.
0.75 A taut, exciting science-fiction thriller that pumps up our adrenaline without forgetting to engage our heads.
0.6 A rollicking deadpan comedy with more good laughs than Adam Sandler's entire career.
0.8 This film is as entertaining as any film that I've seen so far this year.
0.9 Revisiting the Terminator was the right decision for Arnold and a great movie experience for us.
0.2 ennui with a dash of nostalgia
0.7 Pounds forward with brute force, squeezing in plot points wherever possible.
0.9 For the first time this century, sci-fi fans have a sequel that won't leave them disappointed. T3 delivers!
0.75 The film reimagines the Adam and Eve myth but with a post-industrial edge and a distinctly feminist slant.
0.7 Super spectacular summer popcorn picture, packing more fireworks than the Fourth of July. Adrenaline addicts are gonna love the fast-paced action.
0.7 The film's relentless devotion to headlong action and blitzkrieg plotting is akin to falling down an elevator shaft in the dark. You never quite know what you're going to hit along the way, so you might as well enjoy the plummet.
0.84 Once again, the Terminator series proves its superior worth over competing action concepts with its emphasis on the human element and a higher level of story consistency.
0.875 I was pleasantly surprised and duly impressed. Jonathan Mostow has taken good care of Cameron's baby, showing both respect and homage to the characters and trends.
0.625 one-half a very bad movie and one-half a very good movie
1.0 Sure, [Back to the Future II] has a clunky first act - which takes place in a hilariously overblown futuristic society - but the film knows just how, and when, to entertain us, and it does so in spades.
0.6 Lackluster yet benign time-travel sequel.
0.8 Taken as a pair, the first two films ask a number of unresolved and unresolvable questions about causality, order, and intention; and taken as a pair, they're also a hell of a lot of fun.
0.625 The one thing the film got right was the crushed effect the media's growing omnipresence has had on human existence.
0.7 See website for more details.
0.6 Solidly entertaining.
0.5 An ambitious film that fails to recreate the warmth or excitment of the first Back To The Future.
0.6 There are definitely aspects of laziness to the script--jokes which haven't been fully considered, simpleminded characterizations, subplots which have no life outside of the narrative--but at the same time the movie has a spirit of exploration and daring,
0.625 The film works best through its magnificent technical achievements (the visual effects received an Oscar nomination) and the inherent charm of Fox, Lloyd and, especially, the delightfully menacing Thomas F. Wilson.
0.8 The relatively quaint and simple time travel arc from BTTF gets far more confusing and, in some ways, more fulfilling.
0.4 A weak, convoluted attempt to cash in on the original's charms.
0.8 It manages to be giddily and merrily mind-boggling rather than confusing.
0.6 Unfortunately, the story is not as novel or as funny the second time around.
0.8 Uneven but still enjoyable, delivers a darker scenario than the ending of the first film would imply.
0.4 More frantic, noisy, and overproduced than funny
0.9 Doesn't surpass the original, but tosses a whole lot of gee-whiz gizmos and concepts at the screen. It's a whole lot of fun.
1.0 'De Volta Para o Futuro 2' e uma continuacao a altura do original e merece ser visto - antes que o velho Biff altere tudo novamente.
0.625 The film ultimately relies on too many cheesy make-up routines in which characters play their older (and female!) selves which makes it not exactly the best movie in this series.
0.8 The idea and the execution is so good that you could applaud.
0.75 The movie is fun, mostly because it's so screwy.
0.8 Wild West-themed final installment is fine for older tweens.
0.75 avoids many of the previous sequel's narrative and logical pitfalls and reengages more successfully with the simple, direct pleasures that made the 1985 original such a hit
0.9 Back to the Future Part III continues to move the spirit of the series forward in new and exciting directions, and it reaches a satisfying conclusion to the overarching story.
0.6 Every bit as confident and slick as its two predecessors; but it is hard to ignore a distinct feeling of deflation.
0.375 It ain't only the DeLorean that's out of gas.
0.8 A fitting end to one of the most enjoyable fantasy series of the 1980s.
0.8 A clever and enjoyable wrapping-up of the time-travelling adventures.
0.75 Fttingly the one installment in the trilogy that most resembles an old-fashioned movie, from its lovingly evoked western setting to its charmingly sentimental mood.
0.7 Overall this is a good time, but the steampunk adventure doesn't thrill us quite as much as the original.
1.0 Solid end to super fun trilogy; Fox & Lloyd still great
0.5 Except for Mr. Lloyd, the film is so sweet-natured and bland that it is almost instantly forgettable.
0.8 The weakest of the trilogy, but this franchise never got old.
0.6 The new film not only spoofs westerns, but spoofs itself to the point the viewer is constantly reminded this is only a movie.
0.6 Mildly entertaining conclusion to the iconic 1980s trilogy. Everyone is to be commended for quitting while they were ahead.
0.8 The wheels were just starting to come off a bit, but the old-fashioned Western gimmick provides just enough spark. The actors, as always, are effortlessly appealing.
1.0 'De Volta Para o Futuro 3' fecha com chave de ouro esta fantastica trilogia (na verdade, um grande filme de 6 horas de duracao).
0.75 It manages to recapture the sense of fun that made the first Back to the Future so memorable and enjoyable.
0.625 Makes a few bows in the direction of time-travel complexities, and then settles down to be a routine Western comedy.
0.8 Not as tremendous as the first movie but it is thrilling, funny and very exciting.
0.375 Somehow, you can't help but feel vampires deserve better.
0.4 Rather than create an innovative style to complement the horror-history hybrid, he employs superhero cliches and hackneyed action scenes that only help distract from the ineffectiveness of the film's scant 3-D effects.
0.5 If you thought the American Civil War was about ending slavery, you're in for a rude surprise.
0.5 As a tongue-in-cheek action mashup, Grahame-Smith and Bekmambetov have, for the most part, delivered an entertaining (albeit campy) historical retelling.
0.2 A rancid hot pot of over-caffeinated action, choppy editing, self-importance and retarded scripting, Lincoln is the worst blockbuster in recent memory...
0.5 Frankly, if it gets kids talking about history again, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter succeeds where a lot of other films stumble-and even if it's kind of a lame duck, there's still a lot of dignity in that.
0.5 What you get with "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" is an interesting concept that has a number of structural problems.
0.35 Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter doesn't even come close to living up to the fun, silly nature of its premise. The film is a dull, humorless, ugly-looking slog.
0.3 With the most preposterous of plots, one would expect "Lincoln" to be funny, but it's not. It takes itself as seriously as a disease, and therein lies the biggest problem with this film.
0.6 completely ludicrous but fun.
0.85 While the film eventually feels a little exhausting, particularly in the protracted but impressive finale, it works as well as this material possibly could.
0.2 Bekmambetov knows his way around supernatural movies very well but he just doesn't seem to have the sense of humour needed for this one.
0.6 The most important thing about enjoyably trashy, title-says-it-all action films such as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is to keep everything moving so fast and on such a huge scale that nobody will care too much about how monumentally silly it all is.
0.5 Uses cues from the life of the former US President and builds an unwieldy supernatural story on top of it.
0.6 AL:VH is easy to dismiss and equally as easy to forget, but it does what it does well.
0.4 Sounds like it was pitched at the tail-end of a particularly cynical, three-day, coke-fuelled marketing strategy session in between Transformers with Boobs and The Voice: The Movie...
0.7 What makes Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter so enjoyable is the extent it abandons so many established rules not just in terms of history and genre, but also physics.
0.8 Other than not knowing what's going on when the action gets heavy, "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" is fairly outstanding. It's downright ridiculous at times and extremely outrageous to its core, but is unbelievably entertaining from beginning to end.
0.625 The Great Emancipator becomes a pretty great decapitator in this ridiculous and entertaining but ultimately exhausting mashup of 19th century American history and 21st century pop trendiness.
0.7 A lot better than I'd expected. In itself, that's not saying all that much since I was prepared for it to be pretty bad.
0.5 ...a missed opportunity that's rarely, if ever, as much fun as its title might've indicated.
0.4 After simply ignoring everything potentially funny and lively, Abraham Lincoln grinds down on its characters, turning them into empty vessels upon which to hang the action sequences.
0.2 No, it's not entertainment; it's garbage.
0.75 Lincoln a Bloody Alternate History Lesson
0.75 If there's anything more radical and outrageous than the very title and concept, it's how focused and committed director Timur Bekmambetov and writer Seth Grahame-Smith are to its execution.
0.375 Intriguing title the most interesting thing about Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter
0.25 Lacking cleverness and imagination, the film merely fuses Lincoln's and the Civil War's historical outlines with horror-, martial arts- and action-movie cliches.
0.5 while the fantastically warped nature of the premise would seem to promise bloody good fun, the film turns out to be a rather dreary, overly serious slog through the all-too-familiar elements of modern action and horror genres
0.625 Some good effects, but takes its potentially amusing premise way too seriously.
0.4 This one needed to have a sense of humor.
0.5 Mixing vampires with Abraham Lincoln never works in this action movie.
0.75 The movie works because the story outside the vampire zone sweet spot is played straight and with some heart.
0.5 Even for those looking for crazy fun, I think they'll be disappointed with how serious, and how much of Lincoln's life is actually included in this mashup.
0.26 [It] states the moronic what-if that serves as its central conceit right in its title, but even that is unlikely to prepare you for the turgid mess that it delivers.
0.375 ... a monotonous, knuckle-headed fusion of Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' and John Ford's 'Young Mr. Lincoln' ... the action is more stultifying than suspenseful, more cartoonish than cathartic.
0.4 Ridiculous and revisionist, redeemed only by Bekmambetov's inventive, R-rated action sequences, particularly the CGI horse stampede.
0.7 With its outrageous premise of turning Honest Abe into a slayer of the undead, one would expect to see the president snuffing out vamps in astounding ways. To this end, and as pure, thrill-ride entertainment, the movie certainly delivers.
0.5 Not nearly as much fun as it sounds.
0.6 If you are going to re-imagine the 16th president of the United States as a vampire hunter, go big or go home. "Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter" has chosen the former.
0.1 Reminds me of the Star Wars prequels... Vampire powers and limitations seem to work a lot like the Jedi...it depends on what's convenient for the plot at any given moment.
0.375 This Lincoln, as portrayed by Benjamin Walker, is as stiff as the sculpture honoring him at his memorial in Washington, D.C. Walker fails to instill any vitality or zest into his Lincoln. His Abe is one dimensional and humorless.
0.625 The movie may not totally succeed in what it wants to do, but neither should it be dismissed.
0.5 If you see Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and expect brilliant filmmaking, cogent storytelling or a serious examination of American history, you're an idiot.
0.8 As played by Walker, Abe is a 19th Century Bruce Wayne or Clark Kent, his mild demeanor a mask for a man of strength.
0.7 Of course it's ridiculous and tasteless and grotesque. It's ABRAHAM LINCOLN, VAMPIRE HUNTER.
0.4 Vampire Hunter will appeal to people who want to see graphic deaths and a bit of neck-nibbling, but it's a disjointed action adventure and a total no-hoper as a film of any historical significance.
0.5 The disconnect between intention and final product is a head scratcher.
0.3 The execution is neither serious or jokey enough to make the movie palatable - a near impossible result for a movie with that title.
0.8 It's crazier than an antebellum bedbug, but Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter is one of Summer 2012's definite sleepers.
0.2 The Great Emancipator as the Great Decapitator makes for just so much B-movie schlock.
0.7 The upside: the vampires really suck and the movie doesn't.
0.25 A B movie treated like an A movie that mostly ends up being a zzzzzzzzzz movie.
0.375 This film should be campy fun, but in Bekmambetov's unsteady hands, it feels laboured and unsatisfying.
0.7 It's sad to say, but in a summer awash with sequels and reboots, a movie that is both effective and original is a rare treat, no matter how many history teachers it pushes into early retirement.
0.5 How goes this particular Nosfera-tour? Sadly, this new-fang-led premise gives great visuals, but takes itself so seriously, we don't get the fun that the title promises.
0.4 It's rather a shame that yawning voids occupy the places where we usually expect to find characters.
0.72 What you wouldn't expect is for a film where Abraham Lincoln uses a silver-tipped axe to chop of vampires head to be played straight. Well, as straight as an action film featuring a Civil War jam packed with vampires can be.
0.625 There's a conceptual flaw here: the actual details of Lincoln's life were so fascinating, filled with such drama, that there's no need to make him a vampire hunter at all.
0.75 In a movie that promises to be about little more than Abraham Lincoln and Vampire Hunting, having Mr. Walker deliver a performance that exceeds those expectations is -- to some small, ironic degree -- liberating.
0.8 Is Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter a great bad movie or a bad great movie?
0.65 If you're even remotely considering buying a ticket to see Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, then you're a prime candidate to enjoy it.
0.6 Works best when Bekmambetov is let off the leash, and goes WAY over the top. Worth seeing as long as you go in with the right frame of mind.
0.4 The grave tone makes it stiff and leaden, the digi-saturated look is a turn-off. Damnable and disordered.
0.5 It's sort of like a very special slavery-themed episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
0.5 It relies solely on the gimmick that it's funny to have an ex-President using a silver-coated axe to fight mythical creatures. There's nothing else there.
0.2 "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" is essentially the most expensive Troma movie ever made, lacking the quiet dignity, cohesive plotting or the shot of a flipping car
0.37 Reimagining Abraham Lincoln as a forefather to Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a rather nifty idea. Unfortunately, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, doesn't fully sink its teeth into its fun premise.
0.375 The trouble with the so-called high-concept film is that too often the concept is the best thing about it and the actual movie essentially a series of rather rote, progressively more tiresome variations on its premise.
0.6 The result is a movie that seems more in service to its premise than to a good story. But hey, it's different.
0.0 Don't let the stupid title dissuade you from seeing "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter." Let the stupid plot, the stupid history, the stupid action scenes, the stupid trivializing of slavery . . .
0.6 This has enough vamps being decapitated to keep you interested but isn't as gloriously silly as the title.
0.6 For the most part Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is loud, fast and crunchy - and I suspect it's going to slay audiences at the box office.
0.625 Both terribly silly and a lot of fun.
0.75 An insanely absurd fun mash up of horror and history that manages to be simultaneously brilliant and ridiculous.
0.625 This almost works, but the script isn't realized enough to be fully satisfying. It all looks cool and dandy, but it's cold blooded.
0.5 Apart from [two action] scenes and the initial setup, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter becomes repetitive.
0.8 If ever there was an "either you're in or out" movie in 2012, it's definitely this one and if you're in, it just might be the most satisfyingly guilty pleasure of the year.
0.1 Not to sound like a stick in the mud, but Abraham Lincoln was a great and noble man. He deserves better that this.
0.4 This movie is even sillier than I thought it would be. You talk about shark-jumping, fridge-nuking. I have a new one for you, horse leaping! Once that happens, that's when it goes off the rails and begins it's descent into Movie Hell
0.5 Starting well and culminating in a lackluster second half, it is far too streamlined and spotty to satisfy as anything more than a pulpy slice of summer movie inconsequence.
0.4 This movie just made Steven Spielberg's life easier because his Lincoln biopic coming out in December wil definitely be the better of these two films. This could have been fun, it never settles in what it wants to be and ultimately fails.
0.4 This is hokum on a grand scale, though it's emotionally cold and gets tiresomely repetitive, with scores of vampires baring their fangs before decapitation.
0.5 The result is a film that feels more like the ridiculous Will Smith Wild Wild West and less like Bekmambetov's clever Night Watch.
0.0 [Bekmambetov's] name above the credits is fair warning; shame on me for not heeding it.
0.75 Walker is a tall, lean guy with a big hat who can swing an ax. What else can be said?
0.4 It's not every day you see a movie and ask yourself, "Why does this thing even exist?"
0.625 Despite its factual dismemberment of the movie's namesake, Hunter bristles as summer action fodder. Honest.
0.8 Rare is a film this silly that's also this quietly clever.
0.25 Here is the worst thing to happen to Abe Lincoln in a theater since he attended "Our American Cousin."
0.4 Given the subject matter, an exercise in delicacy and restraint was unlikely, but it's too bad that the film's concept is way more entertaining than what has ended up on-screen.
0.4 "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" is such a smashing title it's too bad someone had to spoil things by making a movie to go with it.
0.6 Your mileage, as with any movie crammed with unintentional laughter, may vary, but there are performances and some spectacular fight choreography that ought to keep anyone's interest.
0.35 To say that it's an exercise in style over substance is perhaps an overstatement, in that it suggests there's any substance here at all.
0.625 With a title like this, don't expect a PBS documentary.
0.6 Bekmambetov directs with gusto, and the forthright absurdity of the story, combined with its weirdly heartfelt self-belief is winning.
0.2 This insipid mashup of history lesson and monster flick takes itself semi-seriously, which is truly deadly.
0.8 It's exciting, witty and very well-cast with some memorable set-pieces and a tight, suspenseful plot.
0.375 The acrobatic repetition bores you breathless. Spare Benjamin Walker, who deserves to go on to better things. But the movie deserves a stake through the heart.
0.7 Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter has heart to spare, and the occasional silvered bayonet to run it through.
0.625 Most filmmakers would render this "Road Warrior"-style finale with a little wink and nudge, but Bekmambetov chooses to stare down the material. It straddles his Civil War tale between Chancellorsville and Cartoon Land.
0.875 "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" is a blast, the best action movie of the summer.
0.2 It constitutes a moral sin, if not an outright moral crime, and commits a grave insult against history.
0.4 The problem with movies based on a single joke is that a single joke is rarely funny enough to sustain the running time of a feature-length film. And with "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," the whole joke is in the title.
0.625 Timor Bekmambetov doesn't need to make his material overtly wink at the audience because his conceit is itself enough of an obvious dim-bulb joke.
0.625 The concept of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is worthy of a good chuckle or two, but the execution proves that sometimes a clever title does not beget a production of equal value.
0.25 It's a sin against entertainment.
0.4 When 3D dust-motes and train-engine sparks are the most tempting things to look at, something has failed.
0.6 A strange mash-up that doesn't entirely work but offers enough entertainment value that it never feels like a complete waste of time either.
0.0 It is the best title of the year and will almost certainly be the worst movie.
0.6 While the character development & screenplay are a complete mess, ALVH, at times, is an incredibly interesting movie [with] some brilliant CGI work & incredible choreography..
0.5 There's no getting around the fact that this is a straight-faced drama that feels like it should be a satirical comedy/adventure. And as Lincoln himself observed, a movie divided against itself cannot stand.
0.375 "History prefers legends to men," Abe narrates from his diary. Writer, director and star have conspired to give us none of the above - not the history, not a compelling legend, and certainly not Lincoln the man.
0.4 Some of Bekmambetov's action sequences are spectacular as you would expect, but they are also wholly lacking in any sense of peril or jeopardy.
0.5 It's not nearly as snappy or campy as it should be-though its self-seriousness is its own kind of entertainment.
0.5 It sounds fun. It's a little fun. For a while. But Bekmanbetov shoots every killing spree like an addled gamer, working that slow-down-speed-up kill-shot cliche like a maniac.
0.25 Enormous in its scope and colossal in its stupidity.
0.4 The giddy fun implied by that preposterous moniker is missing in this almost entirely humourless affair.
0.25 Where does it end? Franklin D. Roosevelt: Phone Sex Operator? Rosa Parks: Breakdance Champion? It's much more fun to come up with these idiotic concepts than to watch them.
0.375 Walker's face is soft, bland, unremarkable. His acting, likewise.
0.75 A more entertaining movie than I remotely expected.
0.4 An adaptation of a textbook would at least have been more educational.
0.375 What ideally might have been playful and knowing is instead uptight and dreary, with a visual scheme that's so fake and cartoony, it depletes the film of any sense of danger.
0.5 "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," which boasts one of the best film titles ever, just grazes its target.
0.4 Essentially a lot of balls.
0.8 The premise may be pretty ridiculous, but this movie surprises by actually making sense.
0.4 The appallingly self-serious Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is stylised to death and lacks the subversion needed to support its inspired premise.
0.8 Move over, Twilight. This is a vamp flick with teeth.
0.4 Arrive two hours late for Bekmambetov's overcooked noise generator and you'll have a fantastic night.
0.55 Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter's heart may be in the right place -- and any film that makes people interested in reading up on the real Lincoln must be commended -- but overall the film is, ironically, bloodless.
0.875 ...as buoyant as you'd expect from a movie largely set amidst the clouds.
0.875 One of Japanese writer-director Hayao Miyazaki's best films.
0.6 A Star Wars-like animated feature about a legendary city behind the clouds and the many secrets it holds about nature, robots, light, and magic.
0.7 Castle in the Sky is an...uplifting experience. It's the perfect place to view where Miyazaki has been and where he intends to go.
0.8 Exciting, all-ages anime airborne fantasy epic.
0.875 Unusually detailed animation glides hand in hand with the film's aura of wonderment.
0.75 It shows the master still learning, still discovering his pacing.
0.6 Some of the action verges on the cartoonish, but Miyazaki's extraordinary realism in dealing with his characters is already evident in this fun adventure story.
0.9 My favorite Miyazaki film
0.75 Interesting for the Miyazaki scholar for sure but still feeling its way in terms of the connectivity and brilliance of Miyazaki's later plots.
0.625 Try to picture Terry Gilliam doing an animated Star Wars by way of Jules Verne.
0.6 The movie is gorgeously animated and has many powerful images and ideas.
0.75 The incomprehensible back story didn't dim my enjoyment much. The movie is a crackerjack audio-visual thrill ride.
0.875 Exhilarating, intelligent and compelling with plenty of surprises and dazzling animation.
0.6 Fans, go be with your people. Others, approach cautiously.
0.6 The widescreen canvas is an improvement over television's limited expanse. But if you're not among the indoctrinated, don't bother.
0.75 This is a very intelligent, well-plotted story - and my hunch is that we have not seen the last of our heroes.
0.625 At some point you have to ask: When are fantasy fans going to tire of heroes and villains throwing bolts of energy at each other? Give it a rest already!
0.5 Soporific exposition culminates in a visually chaotic final act that makes "Tintin'' look downright restrained.
0.625 Like a lot of anime, the movie remains entertaining even when you have no idea what's going on.
0.625 The Sacred Star of Milos manages to be an entertaining and faithful expansion on the original material while being inconsequential to it.
0.625 This is a gripping mystery in its own right, and even retains the original Japanese voice actors (with subtitles).
0.6 Uplifting (for some) fantasy-comedy-drama. Stick with original version from 1950s.
0.2 A sugary and sickening Disney remake...
0.6 Serviceable, but why does Tony Danza have to die?
0.0 Terrible fantasy. Full of depressing things like orphans and death. No amount of angels can uplift that.
0.2 On behalf of Angels fans everywhere, I demand an apology from the makers of this film.
1.0 Endlessly imitated but never rivalled, this opening instalment of George Lucas's original space trilogy dresses up the timeless tale of good versus evil with ground-breaking special effects and a dazzling array of intergalactic characters.
0.875 What places it a sizable cut about the routine is its spectacular visual effects, the best since Stanley Kubrick's 2001.
0.8 Sci-fi action classic perfect for sharing with older kids.
0.8 First of a sci-fi phenomenon, #4 in the series.
0.8 Lucas consegue imprimir energia a direcao e estabelece seus personagens como figuras imediatamente iconicas, mesmo que, aqui e ali, seus pessimos dialogos comprometam a experiencia.
1.0 It is a sweeping epic with classical themes lifted from the teachings of Joseph Campbell, but it maintains strong central characters.
1.0 So, is this the best film of all time? Certainly not. But it definitely is one of the most enduring, and it's hard not to be seduced.
1.0 Puts most recent 'epic' blockbuster mediocrities to shame.
1.0 One of those few films that you can expect to find in almost anyone's collection.
1.0 Lucas' trilogy earned its place in eternity not for its mechanical precision, but for its intangible qualities of inspiration and wonder.
0.9 ...the key to the movie's success is its creation of a family of characters we can love and believe in.
1.0 The movie, modeled after old-fashioned Westerns and Joseph Campbell's writings about mythology, also has a sweet innocence.
1.0 classic
0.9 Those of us who were old enough to catch the film as kids the first time around may even find an unexpected lump in their throats as the nostalgia gates bust wide open and Vader gets his, once again, on that giant, silver screen.
0.9 What's fascinating from a cinematic point of view is the magnificently derivative nature of the film. It's an enormous summary of characters, styles, and plot points that surveys 40 years of film history.
0.8 Like many people from my generation, Star Wars is not just a favorite film, but an almost spiritual experience from childhood.
1.0 I can't deny that this is one of the most important and influential movies ever made, and there is more fun stuff in this film than in most.
1.0 Simplemente, y hablando de la cinta: The Force will be with you, always.
1.0 Despite being over-hyped, over-marketed, and fairly flawed, Star Wars remains one of the most memorable and glorious fantasies ever made.
1.0 a communal experience, best seen on the big screen with a large group of enthusiastic people
0.8 It's all very impressive, though I think I'd probably appreciate it a little more if I hadn't literally grown up on Star Wars and its sequels.
0.9 Watching Star Wars again with full knowledge of all that will happen lends some new meaning.
0.9 [An] essential part of contemporary culture.
1.0 George Lucas's space fantasy struck the vortex of American popular culture.
1.0 A grandiose and violent epic with a simple and whimsical heart.
0.85 A classic American tale!
1.0 Lucas fills his screen with loving touches.
1.0 Like some indefatigable King of the Hill, it stands alone and triumphant, regardless of the many imitators that assail its position.
1.0 I was and still am fascinated by the hinted at but never fully developed chemistry between Luke and Princess Leia.
0.9 As much as it changed the people who watched movies, however, it changed the people who made movies even more.
0.875 This special edition re-release really drives home the differences between seeing a movie in the theater and seeing it on video.
0.9 It's easy to see why Star Wars held such an appeal to the kids and adults of the late 1970s.
0.75 A pop-culture landmark!
1.0 All in all, this movie is a classic.
1.0 Twenty years later, George Lucas' loved saga of the war between good and evil in a distant galaxy returns in digitally enhanced and augmented form.
0.8 It's fun and funny.
0.4 High Spirits is a good time but the film is far from Jordan's best, and isn't quite what one would call "memorable", even with the fun effects and witty quips from O'Toole.
0.2 Flat and sitcom-y; Hannah's costume looks like a plastic trash bag
0.8 I saw this movie when I was lonely and it helped somewhat.
0.0 Ghastly ghost story.
0.2 What was Neil Jordan thinking?
0.6 Not Neil Jordan at his best
0.39 High Spirits most clearly resembles a disturbingly hollow combination of Ghostbusters, Police Academy, and every loud noise you've ever heard.
0.3 Battle: Los Angeles misses every mark it aims for. Aside from the well done special effects nothing in this movie is worth recommending.
0.5 It's not new, it's not novel and it's not art. But as a popcorn movie a couple of months out of summer season, it'll have to do.
0.6 Just the worst, most cliche-ridden bunch of faceless cannon fodder you've ever had the misfortune to watch die.
0.25 Jonathan Liebesman's "Battle: Los Angeles" is one of those rare films that fails on just about every level a film can fail on.
0.6 Eat some leatherneck lead, E.T. -- and semper fi, space scum!
0.4 Not as bad as the other recent invasion movie Skyline, but still nothing to be excited about.
0.5 For an alien invasion film, this one is a solid effort, though there's a bit too much violence and not enough introspection.
0.5 ...Battle Los Angeles fizzles out long before it reaches its tedious, anticlimactic finish.
0.83 a kind of cross between what I imagine the first person shooter video game experience to be and an episode of the HBO series Generation Kill
0.75 ... lock-and-load sci-fi - "Full Metal Jacket" meets "War of the Worlds.
0.7 From beginning to end, this thing just keeps jackhammering at your nerves. Sure, there are a few moments of comic relief, both intended and not.
0.625 It's a decent night out, provided you know what you're in for.
0.3 full review at Movies for the Masses
0.4 One part War of the Worlds, one part generic stoic army guy movie from 1957 set during WWII, one part Independence Day, one part goofy dialogue.
0.8 An out-of-this-world blast.
0.5 Only serviceable as a war movie and completely ridiculous as a science-fiction yarn, 'Battle: Los Angeles' is an average actioner that's barely one level above the Syfy Channel's 'Battle of Los Angeles.'
0.4 There's the standard complement of soldier stereotypes: About-To-Be-Married Guy, Twitchy PSTD Case, Stoic African, and The Commander Who Just Graduated OCS.
0.6 Don't expect too much more than a gritty tour of duty against ET's angry cousins and you'll be totally satisfied.
0.6 For all its (many) flaws and derivative story elements, Battle: Los Angeles still has all the mindless fun and excitement of a really good high school food fight.
0.5 This is a war movie that is dressed up like a sci-fi film to sneak in a message about Iraq and Afghanistan.
0.5 With its cliched, one-dimensional characters, the movie fails to engage at an emotional level.
0.6 A realistic war movie gives way to melodrama and a really poor second half.
0.375 The film constantly blows thick smoke up our a---s and calls it charity.
0.4 Se fosse espremido e engarrafado, resultaria num perfume batizado como Le Phallus.
0.6 rather than actively fighting the cliches inherent in this genre, they have consciously, even joyously, embraced them
0.6 ... probably better than it has any right to be.
0.7 It's a top-to-bottom completely typical war film, just one involving aliens. If you can get behind that conceit, it's not bad at it what it does. If you can't, there's nothing else here for you.
0.4 The special effects are mediocre and the story is strewn with the type of plot inconsistencies and lazy dialogue all-too-typical of today's post-content blockbusters.
0.5 At times, the film dazzles with its almost seamless spectacle, but not as much can be said for the needless backstory preamble and an overindulgent aural overload that drowns out the best scenes.
0.2 More like "Battle: Indistinguishable, Concrete Laden Locales."
0.3 Characters walking from one set to another, screaming and shooting, an explosion, and the slightly whittled-down group walks to the next sense, rinse, repeat.
0.7 Battle: Los Angeles is the right kind of "Hoorah!" that the alien invasion sub-genre needed.
0.2 Watching this nonsense after seeing tragic television images of the destruction of Japan somehow made Battle: Los Angeles appear even more meretricious.
0.4 Battle: Los Angeles lapses into that peculiar modern-day rut that leaves an audience feeling as if they are watching a live feed of someone playing a photo-realistic computer game.
0.7 It is a well executed one-violent-trick pony, designed for the 12 year old boy the movie studios hope is still playing with toy soldier figurines inside us all.
0.6 Eckhart is a refreshing alternative to Messrs Stallone and Schwarzenegger in this movie.
0.2 Michael Bay and Tony Scott made love to the American flag, birthed a demon spawn and called it Battle Los Angeles.
0.4 I'm sure there's an epic battle going on here, but it's hard to tell when the cameraman is too busy shaking off a swarm of angry bees to capture any of it.
0.2 Like the aliens themselves, the cliches were coming too fast. Unlike the aliens, they are indestructible.
0.4 Director Jonathan Liebsman's decision to keep things at close-quarters - following solely this band of grunts rather than covering the entire city - could have worked had the film itself felt more elemental.
0.636363636364 Action packed with a solid performance from Aaron Eckhart and a large dollop of patriotism
0.2 How many times can we watch Marines taking cover and returning fire at barely glimpsed aliens before our eyes glaze over?
0.625 According to a TV commentator, the aliens 'are here for our resources... we are being colonized.' But don't expect any references to chickens coming home to roost. There's no irony in this particular presentation of doomsday deferred.
0.4 The real battle in this duff alien invasion movie is whether the direction is worse than the writing.
0.4 Really need to watch District 9 again. Immediately.
0.4 The X-Box game this film wants to be would be ten times more involving, and wouldn't feature Ne-Yo.
0.625 A pro-war movie masquerading as a disaster film? This is the anti Hurt Locker.
0.7 The pace is fast enough and the goal of victory so seemingly elusive that this is a pretty entertaining ride, despite the total lack of story and character development.
0.4 Feels less like a movie than the action scenes clipped out of one.
0.375 Neuron-rotting brain candy: an empty action exercise made up of empty calories. That'd be fine, if only it were sweet.
0.5 It's by-the-numbers, big-screen video gaming. Hooh-ra!
0.5 There are so many missed opportunities for interesting sci-fi elements, but this movie isn't interested in that. It's a military ground war action film, and even that isn't sustainable.
0.375 At least if the aliens win, we won't have to sit through any more movies like this one.
0.2 If you're the kind of person for whom "they blowed it up real good" is a positive review, you'll love this film.
0.6 So po-faced that it almost feels like a spoof, this energetic action epic is watchable due to its solid cast and visceral tone. And the story and characters are so thin that you almost admire the filmmakers' nerve.
0.5 Excitement? Not so much.
0.6 It's pretty much a running gun battle from jump, which is good.
0.3 I don't know why this movie exists. A completely unoriginal mash-up of every good alien invasion film there's ever been, resulting in an ugly, uninspired, laughably bad mess that'll give you motion sickness while making your ears bleed.
0.07221 Tedious, lazy and thoroughly nauseating with no palpable thrills or excitement to be found. The asinine script and excessive use of shaky-cam will make your eyes and ears bleed simultaneously.
0.25 We all know a guy who is obsessed with military firepower and who spends way too much time playing first-person shooters on XBox 360. Battle: Los Angeles is a movie for that guy.
0.625 Battle: Los Angeles will delight your inner 8-year-old while your brain cells wither and die.
0.5 Despite plenty of promise, it's a mirthlessly cliched, spasmodic mess of editing and direction. Still, look on the bright side; at least it wasn't released in 3D.
0.2 Battle Los Angeles is so derivative of superior films that you'll spend half the running time merely making a list of movies that you'd rather be watching.
0.5 It presents an apocalyptic scenario that ought to be tense and horrifying but is instead unintentionally funny.
0.375 Don't mean to boast, but I can suspend my disbelief as willingly as any credulous moviegoer. Yet not even an industrial crane would have helped here. Nope, Battle: Los Angeles completely defeated me.
0.6 Give props to the filmmakers behind Battle: Los Angeles for manufacturing an otherworldly attack that's as brutal, relentless and thoroughly unpleasant as the real thing might be.
0.2 It makes you feel like you are watching someone else playing a videogame while another person is operating a jackhammer approximately six inches away from your skull for two solid hours
0.4 A high-priced, high-tech clone of a video game. The characters move a pixel at a time to this dead-end or that, and each solution presents another, greater challenge.
0.75 'Battle: Los Angeles' is nothing more than another fast paced, cliched action/ sci-fi film but visually splendid and enjoyable.
0.6 It has shortcomings, but Battle: Los Angeles tries hard at being a serious alien invasion movie. Intense battle scenes & an old fashioned portrayal of the military might win audiences over.
0.125 It's not a good sign when, at the end of an alien invasion movie, you're disappointed that the aliens have not emerged victorious.
0.5 Whoever cut together the epic first trailer for Battle:LA deserves an Academy Award. There is a reason why we hear no dialogue in that trailer...
0.25 Alien invasion flick "Battle: Los Angeles" is basically a $100,000,000 recruitment video for the Marines that will help the Corps fill its ranks with gawky gamers who like laughably bad movies. Semper sigh.
0.5 Makes the fatal, conceptual mistake of turning a picture about a mysterious alien attack into a sub-par, propagandistic combat demo reel.
0.625 Smart enough to avoid getting too deep into the personal stories and give you what you want from Battle: Los Angeles. They blow stuff up real good.
0.6 It's all forward momentum, except when it pauses to let Aaron Eckhart's world-weary staff sergeant deliver a generic motivational speech. And even that moment is comfortably familiar, simultaneously superficial and satisfying.
0.4 Pretty much cardboard, down to the heroic patriotic speeches, and less distinctive even than last year's scarcely stellar Skyline, which trashed the same city.
0.4 It's just running, shooting, dodging, killing, not badly done but pretty numbing over two hours.
0.48 Neither as serious as Black Hawk Down nor as lightheartedly fun as Independence Day.
0.7 Recently, astrophysicist Stephen Hawking suggested that if alien life exists, we shouldn't be in a rush to make first contact. Consider Battle: Los Angeles Hawking's cinematic "I told ya so."
0.75 It's a simplistic movie, but there's something appealing about its simplicity.
0.375 This silly extraterrestrial-invasion epic somehow manages the feat of making the destruction of La La Land seem tedious.
0.375 H.G. Wells did it better. This movie spends so much yawn-inducing time on variations of the same combat scenario that its final showdown feels rushed.
0.2 As it lurches from Act II to Act III, "Battle: Loss Angeles" reveals itself to be a lousy movie.
0.2 Director Jonathan Liebesman leaps into the fray with his camera twitching and lurching, capturing more flying metal and concrete dust than actual characters or aliens.
0.8 ...the bigger, badder brother to "Independence Day."
0.4 It's the kind of movie that ends with one of those defeat the enemy by blowing up the one magical thing which can hurt them and conveniently isn't guarded scenarios. And even that feels tacked on
0.5 The plot of Battle Los Angeles is only a few dialogue scenes removed from the objective-based narratives of countless video games concerning warfare in modern times.
0.7 There's a solid war film here, as well as the scary thought of what it might be like if we were the 'collateral damage' instead of people in Iraq or Afghanistan.
0.5 Battle Los Angeles doesn't bring anything new to the alien attack genre.
0.5 For a film that takes inspiration from the same WWII event that helped spawn the screenplay for Spielberg's 1941, it is one that could have used an attack on Hollywood. At least that would have been a little bit of fun.
0.125 Sure to remain one of the most spiritless cinematic experiences of the year.
0.6 If it's daft action and a gung-ho "God Bless America" romp you want, then this is for you.
0.75 Eckhart's commitment to the movie's reality, which is as fierce as the sergeant's commitment to his men, takes what otherwise might merely have been outlandish and makes it believable, and frightening.
0.6 As it stands, Battle: Los Angeles is good dumb fun. A little less talking and a little weirder alien and it might have been something more.
0.4 The entire movie is made from the parts of a dozen other, better movies, and shot in a manner that suggests the cameraman is riding a pogo stick.
0.4 Eckhart performs with laudable conviction, despite the laughable dialogue, but other characters blur into one, and you'll end up feeling as weary as Eckhart's marine.
0.2 Battle: Los Angeles is for American teenagers who found G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra too cerebral.
0.5 You can't help but wish there had been a lot more heart in this Marine's story.
0.4 As Ernest Thesiger might have said: oh my dear, the noise, the extraterrestrials.
0.875 It's a gritty, tension-filled story of soldiers fighting their way through extraordinary circumstances. The characters feel like real people. Their struggles seem genuine. And Los Angeles is going up in flames.
0.75 The film, constructed by people of serious talent, is designed to put you through the wringer, and that's exactly what it does. This is a total war scenario, people. Man up or stand back. Hoo-rah!
0.625 A loud, frenetic, viscerally gripping two-hour tour of duty that mostly plays fair by the rules of the genre and mostly avoids macho posturing.
0.25 Viewed as a parody, this subpar alien invasion flick is worth a few laughs. If only it were meant that way.
0.4 Ultimately, it's likely to top exactly nobody's list of the greatest sci-fi, war, or sci-fi war movies of all time.
0.5 The biggest irony of this project is that it was made by a company that calls itself Original Film but has produced perhaps the least original movie of the year so far.
0.5 As a narrative, the cartoonish Battle: Los Angeles makes the cartoonish Independence Day look as nuanced as Saving Private Ryan.
0.7 The writing is atrocious, but BATTLE: LOS ANGELES is still a fun ride for action junkies.
0.7 There's never a doubt who will win in the aliens versus marines battle, but the fact that it's interesting from the first frame to the last is an achievement.
0.6 this is a movie that, when faced with finding a way out of its considerable contrivances, simply cheats
0.2 On the whole Battle: Los Angeles is the emptiest form of sci-fi action: Just one bloody (or alien gooey) thing after another.
0.5 It's like watching other people play a video game
0.4 ..the real problem with this picture, shaky-cam visuals aside... is its insistent, talky, unnecessary earnestness, which adds a good fifteen minutes of flab to the picture...
0.4 Toting and furious, Michelle Rodriguez is as game as ever in the Michelle Rodriguez Role; otherwise it's personality-free, and hewn from a script of purest Monterey Jack
0.75 This jacked-up B-movie hybrid of "Black Hawk Down" and "War of the Worlds" is a modest but crafty triumph of tension over good sense and cliche.
0.5 [It] isn't nearly as good as any of the movies that may have inspired it, or even its own knockout trailer.
0.625 A solid popcorn movie, with plenty of action, explosions and low-key mayhem unlikely to scar even the most fragile of psyches.
0.5 An electrifying film that manages to be engrossing and entertaining in spite of its flaws.
0.5 Me, I would rather have enjoyed a big breakfast.
0.375 A tiresome fireworks display starring a cast of cardboard cutouts, quick to make a visceral fuss but frustratingly negligent when it comes to providing a reason to care.
0.375 Should have been titled "Call of Duty: Martian Warfare 2."
0.75 A full metal racket, Battle: Los Angeles is like a Michael Bay movie without the meatheaded, over-the-top indifference that usually implies. The destruction is spectacular.
0.6 War of the Worlds meets The Hurt Locker in director Jonathan Liebesman's down-and-dirty alien-invasion flick.
0.6 Rabidly gung ho action thriller that plays like Black Hawk Down with aliens, though the impressive special effects and decent action sequences are badly let down by a script that ensures no cliche gets left behind.
0.125 Here's a science-fiction film that's an insult to the words "science" and "fiction," and the hyphen in between them. You want to cut it up to clean under your fingernails.
0.8 Predictable, obvious, and often corny -- but Battle L.A. is also exciting, kinetic, and six kinds of loud, crazy fun.
0.6 What is an otherwise decent war movie is marred by unforgivably bad writing and even worse acting.
0.6 At a time when Hollywood is generally too afraid to touch America's dual wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Battle: Los Angeles offers up a safer alternative
0.5 Considering there are so many new ways to tell an alien-invasion story (found footage, mockumentary, spoof), Battle: Los Angeles is almost defiantly old-fashioned.
0.625 It might be different with well-developed characters or a story that offers more depth or breadth, but the movie is predominantly pyrotechnics and, as impressive as some of those are, they don't warrant two hours worth of screen time.
0.6 Battle: LA is perfect cinema for gamers.
0.7 'Battle' comes off more like a summer action movie with a massive scope and insane visual effects... 'Battle' is like a wicked mix between the "Call of Duty" and "Gears of War" video games.
0.7 Packs enough firm-jawed, flag-rippling machismo to make Michael Bay look like some mumbling pinko pussy.
0.4 The weak link is Christopher Bertolini's script, which lumbers the flat military characters with hackneyed dialogue and corny sentimentality. Not even Eckhart can survive such banality, and kick-ass specialist Michelle Rodriguez is wasted.
0.6 Imagine Black Hawk Down with ETs instead of Somalis and you'll have the measure of an explosive if functional actioner that will do while we're waiting for summer's big guns to arrive.
0.8 Very funny and genuinely insightful family movie.
0.5 There's something even more hard-to-take than a cherubic tot trying his or her darndest to be adorable: it's an ugly kid acting annoying.
0.375 ...boring and slow and unfunny and a waste of Bruce Willis' time.
0.6 This is obviously a blowoff role for Willis; apart from a few frantic scenes where he thinks he's crazy, he appears to be reading lines in his sleep.
0.8 Si el nio que alguna vez fuimos nos preguntara qu es lo ms importante que hemos aprendido en nuestra vida, qu responderamos?
0.5 Seldom does one find a film that meets expectations so thoroughly.
0.375 Too bad infamously awful director Jon Instinct Turteltaub is at the helm.
0.3 Why am I sick to my stomach?
0.5 Nothing is very believable in the film.
0.5 Screams out for that special, gentle touch, and the filmmakers sadly never realize it. Or maybe they just didn't care.
0.5 So eager to please it ends up falling all over itself, The Kid could have used the more evenhanded touch Wells displayed in directing Guinevere.
0.5 A charmless, predictable picture.
0.4 You'll laugh, you'll cry, but when it's over you'll feel guilty about it.
0.5 Simple, paint-by-number feelings.
0.625 It could have been worse -- much worse.
0.8 A strong film with a big heart.
0.375 Disney's The Kid has a very strong chance at being a 'surprise hit.'
0.5 For all its obviously commercial push, this is a movie of intermittent pleasant surprises.
0.625 More of an adult movie which kids might like, than visa versa.
0.8 Only the hardest heats will refuse to be warmed.
0.75 Warm-hearted and effective.
0.6 It is more than likely that many adults will also see a bit of themselves in the Willis character.
0.75 No es apta para personas amargadas o resentidas con la vida, sino parta aquellos que tienen corazon de pollo y alma de nino
0.7 Has reasonable appeal for adults who had to give up their own dreams.
0.3 A charmless, saccharine sitcom.
0.5 The characters don't act like real people.
0.75 Wonderful family entertainment.
0.625 Jon Turteltaub pilots a moving story.
0.8 The Kid is a delightful, innocuous family film, one that kids will enjoy as well as adults.
0.7 By rights The Kid should be dreadful. Surprisingly enough, it often soars to heights of not bad.
0.6 Average animated action tale features troubled superheroes.
0.4 It's too violent for younger viewers, but not mature enough for older ones. It's a movie trapped in between target audiences.
0.4 It feels like the longest, deathliest panto ever made -- and still it isn't over.
0.625 Maybe Harry Potter could cast a magic spell over us before we see his new movie.
0.7 Yates does a pretty good job with the heavy lifting, but there's not much poetry to this exercise that brings the story of the boy wizard one step closer to its conclusion.
0.8 Deathly Hallows is the first Harry Potter film that fully delivers on the promise of J.K. Rowling's works, expertly balancing a tricky and expansive narrative, along with quiet character moments and some rollicking action sequences.
1.0 As J.K. Rowling wove a conclusion as ominous as it was elegant in the final installment of the Potter series, so too has director David Yates in Part 1 of Deathly Hallows.
0.83 Sure, there are some rearranging and compressing of scenes and facts, but the two-and-a-half hour runtime for half a book allows screenwriter Steve Kloves and director David Yates the space to faithfully retell a really good story.
0.8 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is beautifully shot with wonderful atmosphere and an appropriately dark tone, making it a very enjoyable experience.
0.8 The biggest plus of this film is that the story is brought out of Hogwarts and into a greater world.
0.875 Alternately funny and touching, it's the best film in the series, an "Empire Strikes Back" for these wizards and their wizarding world. And those effects? They're so special you don't notice them.
0.3 This penultimate entry in the series lacks the life and the imagination of its worthy predecessors.
0.75 It seems unfair to chide the entire film for one sagging act, so in the end, this first part gets a slight recommendation for its characters, art direction, and some thrills.
0.875 A terrific set-up to the final chapter of our favorite boy wizard's saga.
0.9 Far more emotionally complex and scary than any previous entry - Potter 7.1 is the franchise's best chapter yet.
0.7 Fortunately, the good outweighs the mediocre, so in the end this is one of the better installments in the series.
0.75 No more professors, no more books; no more Potter's defiant looks.
0.875 The domineering final stretch of a story that has become as much popcorn distraction as old, reliable friend is shaping up to be part family reunion, part merciless slugfest.
0.5 The magic is lost on the very young because of the films' even darker tone.
0.875 The saga of Harry Potter definitely heats up before it winds down.
0.6 Probablemente la mejor de la serie desde El Prisionero de Azkaban (2004), HP7 es una pelicula de clima denso, oscuro y ominoso, excelentemente filmada.
0.78 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I is the first entry of the franchise to really capture the essence of J.K. Rowling's masterworks.
0.8 Although it feels far too long, Yates and Kloves thankfully mix the dark drama with lighter comedy, allowing the characters to grow organically
0.625 Potter stumbles at the finish line with tepid Hallows.
0.9 The trio has clearly advanced beyond the pure buddy stages of childhood.
0.8 Judging by this first half, this touchstone series is well on its way to getting the sendoff it deserves.
0.9 Yates has been building his version of this world for two movies now, and he rightfully doesn't let up.
0.9 Fulfills the promise of Brit TV director David Yates as the perfect Harry Potter director -- and quite possibly as a filmmaker to reckon with in general.
0.8 "Deathly Hallows" is a significant improvement over the slow and talky previous film
0.7 Pretty artful, complex, compelling work for a film that technically doesn't have a beginning or end.
0.75 The grimness of Deathly Hallows replaces the lighthearted tone of the previous films ... how much of an improvement this is depends on how serious you thought the series should be.
0.8 Part 1 concludes with good and evil evenly balanced, both sides having suffered losses in pursuit of ultimate victory.
0.75 The decision to split it into two movies couldn't have paid off more. Yates finally has the time to spend with Harry, Ron, and Hermione that's he hasn't had lately, and the movie is 100 percent better for it.
0.5 In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, the tone has completed its change. The initial innocence, playfulness, and fresh discovery of magic is long gone. Horror now prevails.
0.5 A stop gap, not a movie.
0.7 Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a damn fine piece of film - if I had the faintest idea what was going on in it, I might have enjoyed it even more.
0.5 Has too many plot threads to follow in its willy-nilly efforts to set the stage for the real ending.
0.8 It may be the scariest, but it's also one of the strongest in the series.
0.5 Not wild about this "Harry". Half the book equals half the entertainment.
0.8 It's not without its faults, but those glitches are largely irrelevant because it ticks all the boxes Potter-heads want to see ticked.
0.75 David Yates's third crack at the franchise goes to a dark, interesting place, even if the whole enterprise feels rather played-out, so last decade.
0.6 On its own, it's the worst film in the series since the first two... I suspect it will wear well. It was never meant to be a stand-alone movie, after all.
0.75 A water-treading sequel with no emotional momentum ostensibly serving as a setup for next summer's grand finale
0.75 It's essentially a horror movie, set in the belly of the beast, almost literally: The film's not 10 minutes old before a giant constrictor opens its fanged jaws and swallows the camera lens -- and us -- whole, plunging the screen into darkness.
0.6 If its total success can only be properly measured upon arrival of the conclusion in July, the fact that Part 1 makes that worth waiting for should be taken as some kind of victory.
0.8 While this Harry Potter is the most murky and forlorn so far, its most grave battle is the internal question between the corporate and creative types. We know why the seventh film was extricated into two, but should it really have been?
0.6 Saved by a riveting first hour, excellent cast and beautiful production, a multitude of flaws in pacing, exposition and the strange point at which the film ends puts this chapter far from the best in the franchise.
0.75 the cleaving of Rowling's 759-page finale into two separate films ultimately benefits the material, allowing the filmmakers to take their time and keep as much of the story as possible while also maintaining a taut narrative pace
0.5 The three main leads' deficient acting ability causes the movie to falter in the middle. The absence of the colorful supporting players to bolster enthusiasm is a crucial missing ingredient. The computer-generated special visual effects are...
0.8 Of all characters, Dobby (at one point the Jar Jar Binks of the Harry Potter World) steals the show.
0.75 The coasting comes in the middle of the movie, which is fortunate since it leaves the production with a vibrant opening act and a powerhouse final hour.
0.75 The best-looking and best-acted film in the series so far. Drags a bit in the middle act. Otherwise, a solid wind-up for the grand finale.
0.8 The genius of why this film, like the book, resonates so deeply is that Rowling has found the perfect junction of pure fantasy and real politics gone horribly wrong
0.75 This latest installment is almost Bressonian in its setup and execution. If nothing else, it's audacious.
0.8 Get ready for a long eight months, Potterites.
0.6 full review at Movies for the Masses
0.6 Although it represents a natural progression in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 will be a slog for those new to the Potter universe.
0.75 We might sometimes take the skills of Radcliffe, Grint and Watson for granted ... they deserve acclaim for keeping the continuity of their performances intact for a decade.
0.75 'Part II' won't come until next summer so for now, if you have been a faithful follower, you won't bored at all with this installment, just a bit anxious for the next one.
0.75 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is slower and stranger than any of the previous films, simultaneously raising hopes for a haunting finale while dimming hopes for a magical one.
1.0 By any measure, Deathly Hallows is a ripping thriller.
0.7 ...what should have been great is merely good, a solid prequel to the proposed chaos to come.
0.875 Yates, Radcliffe and the rest of the Potter posse are giving fans exactly what they deserve -- a powerful denouement worthy of a boy wizard who has charmed the world for more than a dozen years.
1.0 'When I say that HP7 is amazing, please understand that if it violated my love for the book, I'd be ripping it to shreds with my bare hands.'
0.73 The dark tone, the real sense of sacrifice, the strained relationships, and an ending that suggests that the good guys are utterly outmatched, combine to give this film stakes that feel like they matter.
0.722 Somewhat unevenly paced and lacks exposition, but there's no denying its stylish, exquisite production values. Avid Harry Potter fans will be captivated, thrilled and left drooling for Part 2.
0.625 Penultimate installment mostly for lovers of the books
0.6 All Yates has to do is coax decent performances out of his young charges and make sure the fantastical is a fair representaion of what happens in the books.
0.8 Harry Potter fans, your bittersweet moment is here. Fortunately, the sweet far outweighs the bitter.
0.8 Excellent, epic saga continues to get darker, more intense.
0.4 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallow: Part 1 is bad on an epic scale. The worst film in the series. Period.
0.5 A meandering, downbeat steppingstone to the Potter series' grand finale.
0.75 We get to see the characters raw and frayed - almost junkie-like - without the saccharine pill coating that usually helps us swallow the bad stuff happening in Harry Potter Land.
0.875 A very satisfying blend of mood and spectacle, action and character, wonder and fear.
0.8 Childhood things ...[are] set aside as our three heroes, now young adults, set off on their own like resistance fighters in a World War II movie.
0.75 The first part of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" is everything fans should expect: It is brooding, a bit scary, action-packed, sentimental, dangerous and grand.
0.875 Who needs Hogwarts?
0.625 The most disappointing of the series, but better than most movies out there.
0.75 Not surprisingly, "Part 1" feels like only half a film, but as this beloved series prepares to draw to a close, it is a mighty good start.
0.8 To the muggles among the critics who carp about this or that, this isn't for you. It's for those of us invested in this saga, and for whom July 2011 cannot come soon enough.
0.875 Readers expecting everything plus the kitchen sink - or, in this case, seven magical Horcruxes - should not be disappointed.
0.625 The build-up to part two is a fine tease to the end of a franchise that has quickly started to feel like a chore.
0.8 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows lacks warmth, whimsy, playfulness and hope. And that is precisely what makes it great.
0.6 This really is a more grown-up affair, and very scary, whether with the Dark Lord's manipulation of his minions in Malfoy Manor, or in Bathilda Bagshot's reptilian stare.
0.875 It's a film of great courage and artistry, a movie ostensibly for children that's also worthy of them.
0.8 There are a number of touches that aren't just magical but also deeply moving.
0.625 This one is a long, archetypal journey that screeches to a halt a few stops short of its destination.
0.8 This is a Harry Potter film that functions as a dark, emotional character study more than a fun adventure, which will be disconcerting for some. But if you love these characters, as many of us do, you'll find a lot to admire.
0.4 Despite its enormous popularity and commercial success, the Harry Potter saga seems destined to be remembered as never quite adding up to the sum of its parts.
0.6 If the film's main job was to whet the appetite for the next one, it does that well.
0.5 Beautifully shot but a soulless cash machine, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1" delivers no dramatic payoff, no resolution and not much fun.
0.75 Radcliffe, Watson and Grint, having literally grown up in their characters, are ready for their close-up. They earned it, they deserve it and they nailed it.
0.75 For the first time, their coming-of-age journey outshines the special effects.
0.875 Menacing and meditative, Hallows is arguably the best installment of the planned eight-film franchise, though audiences who haven't kept up with previous chapters will be hopelessly lost.
1.0 Reclamar da "lentidao" da narrativa seria apenas um atestado da mais absoluta incapacidade de compreender as necessidades do projeto, exigindo acao inconsequente de uma obra mais preocupada em retratar o desgaste de seus protagonistas.
0.6 The three young wizards on a quest that will test their loyalties, courage, and magical abilities to the max.
0.7 I'm certainly ready to see the final entry in the series just to see how it all ends - not that years of spoilers haven't already ruined that for me - but HP7.1 hardly packs in a finale to send you home salivating for 7.2.
0.7 Deathly Hallows I actually manages to be involving and kind of artful about the boredom and loneliness of heroism.
0.625 The truth is that this film is mostly plain work, done by rote, like any introductory potions class. The real fun -- and thrills and tears -- come next year.
0.625 There's nothing inherently wrong with his initial adaptation of J.K. Rowling's seventh and final novel except for the fact that it ends with the best parts of the story yet to be told.
0.625 At 146 minutes, "Part 1" is like a director's cut or a DVD filled with bonus materials that expands to fill the available space through dilution.
0.4 ... dreary, murky and cheap ...
0.7 Warner Bros. had no choice but to split the final installment in the Harry Potter series into two parts, but doing so leaves an unsatisfying feeling when the credits roll.
0.625 Like a virgin's padded bra, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I is all tease, zero payoff.
0.8 Easily the best Potter film since 'Azkaban.' The cinematography is beautiful, the magic is fun and the characters are deep. Did Peter Jackson direct the middle section?
0.625 The upside of this, one supposes, is that when Part 2 comes out next year it will be nonstop excitement. We've already endured the iffy parts.
0.875 The best of the franchise to date, a satisfying, appetite-whetting setup for the series finale.
0.8 'Deathly Hallows' is a true epic, one can only wonder how massive the second half will be.
0.875 This is a three-jumps-out-of-your-seat thriller -- a road movie minus Bob and Bing, a gray-hued travelogue through the shoddy side England, Scotland and Wales -- bog, moor and power plants.
0.9 Even though it ends in the middle, Deathly Hallows: Part 1 finds notes of anxious suspense and grave emotion to send its characters, and its fans, into the last round.
0.7 If in past Potters -- especially the early ones -- Radcliffe, Watson and Grint were wisely surrounded by one acting legend after another, here they're called on to shoulder the story on their own.
0.5 Alas, as directed by the returning David Yates, these big chase sequences are the usual compendium of ear-splitting noise and eye-glazing edits -- again, no magic required and none delivered.
0.625 It's grim, funny in one sequence about shapeshifters, vivid in moments of violent action, nearly devoid of plot twists and marked by long patches where Harry, Ron and Hermione camp in the woods.
0.9 David Yates' fluid, fast-paced direction sends up the crackling tension of a thriller.
0.75 It's the closest the HP movies will get to a reserved character drama. My favorite parts are the tiny, dialogue-less character moments packed with emotional undercurrents.
0.9 Potter devotees will find much to admire in the movie directed by David Yates, although its sensibility is much closer to that of a horror movie than a traditional fantasy/adventure.
0.6 Rowling's flaws as a storyteller are much more evident in this film than in previous installments.
0.8 For those who have felt their emotional investment flourish over the course of six films, indulging extra attention to details is a pleasure.
0.8 Gone are the sweet hijinks at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, as well as any "hey, look at me!" magical inventions; Deathly Hallows is all business -- taut, fraught, and fearsome.
0.7 The filmmakers...adapt Rowling's tale with as much fidelity as their budget, effects crew, production designers, actors, and common sense will allow.
0.8 Drags a bit in the second act, but it's a solid buildup to the final chapter in this legendary franchise.
0.8 Ominous and downbeat but a compelling, visual treat, this certainly whets our appetite for next year's big finale.
0.75 The seventh "Harry Potter" movie asks the most of its audience thus far, and returns the least. If you're not a fan and know nothing of the characters, the film will be a difficult slog. Those bought into the franchise will be appropriately enthralled.
0.6 The film plays more like an extended prologue than a story in its own right. But some stunning set pieces and a beautiful animated segment redeem things considerably.
0.795 Basically, you'll love it if you love Potter and you'll hate if you hate Potter, but if you're just looking for some fun in the theaters you can do far, far, far, far, far worse than Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
0.75 The movie builds erratically to the moment when the end credits start rolling. After sacrificing nearly 2 1/2 hours to this movie, there's a sense that more is deserved.
0.875 For those caught up in the "Potter" world -- and surely anyone who isn't dropped out of this franchise long ago -- "Deathly Hallows" is immensely satisfying.
0.75 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 features some of the strongest, most beautifully realized moments in all of the series. In other respects, it is one of the most fundamentally problematic entries.
0.875 Kloves brings Rowling's world to life, engrossing you in the story and making your truly care about these characters.
0.6 As setup for the long-awaited climax, Part 1 does its job, and manages to take time for some meaningful emotional moments along the way.
0.8 The final book ... has been cleft in twain ... a move that is both cruel and absolutely necessary. Some will argue that the resulting product is merely half a film, and they'd be right. It's also one-eighth of the full story, so why start complaining now?
0.8 Half of the final story, yes, but a beautifully paced film that lingers in the dark magical world as Harry, Ron & Hermoine find themselves in a self imposed exile in search of the fragments of Voldemort's soul.
0.625 I'd be lying if I said I'm not eager to see how everything turns out.
0.4 If you haven't read the book, do so. This is the first 150 minutes of the final novel adaptation (part two next spring) and to me it was virtual gobbledegook.
0.8 Deathly Hallows: Part 1 begins in eerie, chilling darkness and things don't let up from there, as director Yates crafts a truly terrifying spell over the Potter-verse.
0.75 Like Alfonso Cuaron, who made Azkaban, Yates and his crew are as visually descriptive as Rowling was with language.
0.7 It's not a bad movie, but it is very much a transitional one, with Warner Bros. splitting J.K. Rowling's last installment in the "Potter" series into two films.
0.75 Much of the heavy lifting falls to Watson, and, in such moments as the one where she must wipe out her family's memories of her to protect them, she is more than up to the task.
0.5 To be fair to Deathly Hallows, the filmmakers have tried hard to fill the proceedings with battles and chases and debilitating curses. Genuine filmmaking excitement, however, is harder to provide.
0.75 The high quality of the series remains. Returning director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves remain attentive as ever to Rowlings' holy text, and the mood is as magic as always.
0.75 When Warner Brothers announced that it planned to split the seventh, and final, installment of J.K. Rowling's wizarding septology into two separate films, I figured it was all about the money. Turns out it was all about the story.
0.5 More like Harry Potter and the Torturous Moping.
0.8 David Yates better captures both the playful and solemn tones of J.K. Rowling's writing, making Harry's wildest and most dangerous journey also one of great adventure and growth.
0.5 This series is really getting tired. The films of J.K. Rowling's mega-popular books were always handled with grim seriousness by the various directors assigned to them, but at least in the early films there was a sense of magic and originality.
0.3 The pervasive dark tone, the heavy-handed dialogue and the sloth-like pace of Deathly Hallows reflects the self-importance that has now overwhelmed the obligation to entertain.
0.75 It's easy to get lost in the rich, two-and-a-half hour installment, but it wraps up too abruptly.
0.8 While intriguing and action-packed, it's far more perilous, intense and realistic than previous installments.
0.875 A grim landscape for our heroes...So grim, in fact, that you may feel as if Harry, Ron and Hermione are the last survivors of an apocalyptic aftermath and Part II may be all the better for it.
0.7 Fans will enjoy the dark, brooding, gorgeous penultimate film of one of the most solid genre series ever. Casual observers will likely be confused as hell or bored silly.
0.8 The first part of Deathly Hallows has plenty of invigorating imagery alongside the pro forma narrative elements.
0.75 I could watch this stuff all night, and practically did since the movie is so needlessly long.
0.75 The film depends more on mood and character than many of the others, and key actions seem to be alarmingly taking place off-screen.
0.75 I knew magic could be dark - there is plenty of that in Part 1 - but who knew it could also be so sad?
0.8 Equal parts action thriller, political parable, and multidimensional love story, Hallows feels sad and strong and true.
0.75 The story-within-the-story regarding the deathly hallows is visualized by way of shadow-puppet style animation, and the effect is quite beautiful.
0.5 Potter's a plodder. This magician's either out of tricks or frustratingly saving them for next time.
0.9 There is suspense and action in this film, but there is also lots of room for emotion, and for the audience, a satisfying build up to next summer's grand finale.
0.8 This isn't a great movie viewed in isolation but it is near on the perfect adaptation of the prelude to this beloved story's conclusion.
0.9 I'm anxiously awaiting the next Harry Potter, and this is probably the only film series I can think of where each film is better than the last.
0.75 When a movie begins with the Warner Bros. logo crumbling in decay and ends with a defiled grave, you know you've experienced an evening of magic.
0.6 Often just seems to be going round in very decreasing circles, chasing its own fairytale.
0.6 If nothing else, this penultimate film does leave you anticipating how it will all turn out in the final film, which is a lot more than can be said about other comparative film franchises.
0.6 Good enough, even for those of us who have no idea what's going on once the plot resorts to Potterbabble.
0.6 The darker atmosphere and real-world locales makes this the most mature and humanistic entry to date, but it's hard not to miss the warmth and whimsy that has been left behind.
0.9 Deathly Hallows Part 1 is warm without being cloying; frightening without outstaying it's welcome, and it manages to prey on deep-seeded fears with remarkable proficiency.
0.7 Yates has developed a distinctive visual style and there are some striking locations in this film, landscapes that have an almost dreamlike power. And the action has an abrupt kinetic impact.
0.8 On the evidence of this, his penultimate film, the teenage wizard is getting the send-off he deserves.
0.7 An unfamiliar new setting does little to diminish the humour, heart and excitement of the Harry Potter franchise on form.
0.6 A film with no beginning and no end but a whole lot of expository middle, this is the least satisfying instalment in the series since Chris Columbus folded up his director's chair.
0.8 Deathly Hallows: Part 1 definitely whets appetites for the final outing as it builds to a stunning climax tinged with sadness and anticipation about the inevitable battle between Harry and Voldemort which will conclude next year...
0.8 Darker and scarier than its predecessors, this is a fitting and enjoyable run-up to the action packed finale, though it might be a bit baffling if for some reason you haven't read the books or seen the previous films.
0.6 Exposition heavy, Potter 7: Part One is an entertaining but flawed prelude to the real finale.
0.65 Deathly Hallows - Part 1 isn't necessarily bad but it's more than a little disappointing.
1.0 This is a superb beginning to the end of a great British success story. You rejoice that they decided to forgo 3D. The Potter films don't need gimmicks to get our attention.
0.6 The most memorable sequences in the film are not, for once, the action scenes but the acting ones.
0.6 It's gripping alright, but ends all too abruptly.
0.6 While it's by no means a bad Harry Potter movie, the overriding feeling is that it's an incomplete one. Here's hoping that Yates and his team put that right next summer.
0.6 The first and third acts are over-busy; the middle one moves like an arthritic house-elf. Still, a decent smattering of magic moments and tension's pumped up sky-high. Bring on Part 2.
0.8 Your appetite will be whetted for what promises to be an almighty showdown before the curtain comes down on Harry Potter for good.
0.8 We have watched these three growing up and their performances have never been better -- particularly Grint, who gets the opportunity to do more than just play for laughs.
0.4 It's hard to mourn the demise of a franchise that was never more than half-alive to begin with.
1.0 A towering achievement. Or rather, half of a towering achievement.
0.6 The final story may well be colourful and complex, but, on this evidence, there's absolutely no artistic justification for a two-movie split.
0.6 More breathy outbursts from wronged lovers and strange pseudo-sexual and homoerotic encounters than a late-night soap opera, matched with a visual style that points to a level of artistry and invention that even western cinema struggles to match.
0.6 Blindingly gorgeous to look at and exceptionally well acted, at least by the women.
0.125 A vaporous, watered-down frappe of a fantasy epic.
0.9 Cameron maintains the heedless, non sequitur pace of a nightmare without resorting to cheap tactics. The frights of these nightmares, those cracked reflections of reality, hardly feel manufactured or inauthentic. And neither does "The Terminator."
1.0 Wittily written with a nice eye for sharp detail, it's hard sci-fi action all the way.
1.0 A nerve-bludgeoning, relentlessly exciting action movie masterpiece.
1.0 Still a toss-up between The Terminator and Aliens as to which James Cameron picture ranks as his best, this propulsively exciting yarn about a murderous cyborg has long staked its claim as a classic -- science fiction or otherwise -- for the ages.
1.0 Remains a surprisingly meditative work, its concentrated visceral bursts not unlike punctuation marks among something more brooding, even prayerful.
1.0 Throughout his extraordinary, legend in his own time career, James Cameron has done very little that cannot be legitimately considered well ahead of its time.
1.0 I remain perpetually amazed by how magnificently Cameron keeps the tension up... there is not a single moment that isn't operating at 100%.
0.875 A cyberpunk picture that flirts with emotional resonance but mostly focuses on the gut...testosterone-fueled, estrogen-boosted action melodrama.
0.75 James Cameron's fast-paced, downright propulsive directorial sensibilities ensure that there are few lulls within the narrative.
0.8 A sci-fi actioner as relentless as its cyborg title character. The megabudget sequels are very good, but the low-budget original is still the best.
1.0 Arguably among the very best science-fiction contemporaries.
1.0 The movie's scares are intense, but the notion that the Terminator would move on to politics is even more frightening.
1.0 Relentlessly entertaining
1.0 This was the film that demonstrated to the dubious everyone that the musclebound fellow with that outrageous accent might be more than just another passing blip on our pop culture radar screens.
1.0 At the end of both movies, I find myself overcome by an extraordinary swell of emotion.
1.0 The birth of a genre unto itself, followed by an even more ambitious sequel.
0.9 The film that put James Cameron on the map and made Arnold Schwarzenegger an international star, The Terminator is a high-potency distillation of a bunch of sci-fi concepts into one package.
0.8 A surprisingly vicious little film, filled with indiscriminate, un-PC killings and a rough-edged feel that makes it utterly compelling.
0.89 While many feel the sequel is superior, I'd contend that T2 was merely more expensive. If you're building a sci-fi collection, this one should be on your Top Ten list.
1.0 The ingeniousness of The Terminator is in giving us one of the most memorable and brilliant villains ever printed on celluloid.
0.875 The Terminator was James Cameron's second film and remains his most crisply written in every respect.
0.875 seamlessly melds the best narrative mind tricks of science fiction literature with the visceral violence of the best action movies
0.9 ...remains the quintessential Schwarzenegger movie...a high-octane, tech-noir adventure.
0.8 One of the most effective science fiction films of recent decades.
1.0 To my mind better than its successor (for pure freshness) this film shows a keen understanding and love of the sci-fi genre.
0.9 [An] excellent piece of science fiction cinema.
0.875 The movie's strength is that, like The Matrix, it combines action with ideas.
0.4 Low-budget cartoon tells classic story with hopeful ending.
0.625 While the movies are increasingly enamored with ever more elaborate computer animation, [director Phil Nibbelink] delivers a feature that is resolutely old-fashioned in its use of cels. Surprisingly, it's not terrible.
0.2 A comprehensive list of what's wrong with Romeo & Juliet: Sealed With a Kiss would stretch farther than the unabridged works of William S.
0.6 Offbeat live-action/animation mix with lots of drinking.
0.5 The animation is much the best part of Pete's Dragon, a film not surfeited with great & timeless elements.
0.2 A horrid assault on the senses.
0.4 Another not very charming but harmless fusion of animation and good old real-life.
0.5 In the overall realm of Disney magic, Pete's Dragon is a card trick rather than a grand illusion.
0.6 As a testament to its founder's legacy, this is still somewhat lesser Disney. But when viewed in combination for what passes as House of Mouse merriment today ...it's utterly brilliant.
0.5 The film lacks the emotional complexity and classic status of previous Disney films.
0.6 Average Disney, a disappointment if you expect another 'Mary Poppins.'
0.6 You don't often see children's musicals as ambitious as this one any more.
0.0 This movie sucked so bad, I even hated it as a kid.
0.6 A Touching, humourous, and ultimately warm family film.
0.75 One of the first significant American horror movies, and an interesting contrast to the same year's other, more important genre milestone, Germany's 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.'
0.7 A wig, hairy prosthetic hands, and a slouched posture were all Barrymore needed to bring Stevenson's defining creation to life, and he did so with gusto.
0.625 The split persona at the center of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde hews intriguingly close to the personal foibles of star John Barrymore.
0.75 One of three 1920 adaptations of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic allegorical chiller, the Paramount Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is remembered primarily for John Barrymore's bravura performance as the title duo.
0.8 One of the better renditions of the tale, thanks to John Barrymore's brilliant silent performance.
0.8 Not up to the Mamoulian version, but Barrymore's performance makes it essential.
0.6 Shrek Forever After is a very mediocre affair, with crummy 3D and a real lack of laughs.
0.625 "Shrek Forever After" feels more like a direct-to-video release than one that should have been put in theaters.
0.8 Shrek Forever After is a fairy tale ending for the series.
0.6 Shrek Forever After is the latest in a long, mediocre tradition. What charms it does have can't really compete with the charms it doesn't have.
0.6 DreamWorks and the unlovable ogre lose the plot.
0.6 Reveals an urge by the filmmakers to wipe the slate clean, as large an admission that the series is out of ideas as one could get. That said, all involved do try to make the most of it.
0.6 ...sweet and gentle, and the conclusion, while expected, carries a good deal of touching sentiment.
0.6 It's sweet, mildly funny, and a pleasant enough farewell from these once beloved characters. But there's a somewhat melancholy tone to the proceedings, as we watch this franchise try to hold onto its final shreds of dignity.
0.5 full review at Movies for the Masses
0.6 Interestingly, ...Forever After's biggest influence appears not to be fairy tales this time, but rather the Back To The Future series.
0.8 The movie is a family drama about the family drama, so on every available level it works a treat.
0.6 It's a neat enough way of closing the book -- and one hopes it is closed now.
0.7 Has a warm, engaging tone that draws us into the dramatic possibilities rather than the comical ones
0.6 It isn't quite as witty or inventive as you might have hoped but if it is the last film in the series then it offers an honourable conclusion to a wonderful decade of family entertainment.
0.6 An improvement over the last film...
0.6 I admit my gentle, feelgood buzz on leaving the cinema was rather premised on the assumption that the Shrek-pipeline is now empty, but it's an enjoyable film nonetheless and a nice way for the series to finish.
0.4 Shrek Forever After is an amiable but underpowered conclusion to a franchise that ran out of comic ideas six years ago. It is time to lay this ogre to rest.
0.6 If we all loved the first film, enjoyed the second and were disappointed by the third, this fourth and final entry ends the Shrek series on a satisfying high note.
0.6 While it will have to settle for being the second best sequel of the franchise, Shrek's last outing ultimately reminds you of why we fell in love with these characters in the first place.
0.6 Now is the time for DreamWorks to return to the drawing board; to use this $2.5 billion series to invest in something as thrilling and adventurous as the original Shrek.
0.6 The film is engaging enough, due to a narrative gimmick that makes the old ground new again.
0.6 This fourth ogre outing delivers plenty of 3D razzle dazzle and has fun messing about with its alternate-reality storyline, but it never troubles the modernclassic status achieved by the first Shrek. Still, a chunky step up from Shrek The Third.
0.6 Much better than its predecessor, but not a patch on the original, Shrek Forever After would be a respectable point for the irritable ogre's tale to come to an end.
0.6 An entertaining conclusion to the franchise -- one that parents should happily endure. But let's hope that's all, folks.
0.8 DreamWorks could be entering a period of fresh creativity. With How To Train Your Dragon and a balanced, darker-hued and very funny Shrek finale, they've found the magic again.
0.8 Impressively directed and superbly animated, this is a clever reworking of It's A Wonderful Life that manages to freshen up the franchise, allowing for a much darker tone and a subtle revamping of all the characters...
0.2 There's no life to the film, no spark, and more importantly no real reason for this fourth outing to have ever been made.
0.6 A welcome relief. However, it is still far, far away from the heights of the first two installments.
0.55 If anything, it's much better than the third chapter.
0.625 It's not as engaging as the original, but a nice step up from the disappointing third installment.
0.7 As far as blatant milking of cash-cows go, it retains much of the heart and charm of the franchise, if not the cracking humour.
0.8 DreamWorks could be entering a period of fresh creativity. With How To Train Your Dragon and a balanced, darker-hued and very funny Shrek finale, they've found the magic again.
0.6 The Shrek franchise is a hugely enjoyable one, with funny characters and a knowing way with mocking fairy-tales and popular culture.
0.4 Third times are rarely charms in the movies, much less fourth go-rounds, and it takes more than ho-hum 3D and video-game-ready action sequences to liven up diminishing returns.
0.6 Shrek Forever After feels tired, but is lifted by the usual slew of wisecracks and pop culture references. The use of 3-D, while not revelatory, is apt, and adds another layer of appeal to the film's action.
0.6 A rise in quality from the very pedestrian Shrek the Third.
0.6 Shrek 4 shows all the signs of mortuus equus syndrome -- as in, flogging the horse which is not just sleeping.
0.6 All in all, it's not the spectacular send-off Shrek deserves but, as a way to get out, it's not too shabby either.
0.8 What's been achieved here is still highly hilarious. The original concepts are that solid.
0.75 The key, as Fiona points out, is to know when you have everything, and be grateful. It's a worthy conclusion to the tale. We can all live happily ever after.
0.75 This "final chapter" doesn't try too hard %u2014 save for the finale %u2014 to become an after-school special, the way the dreadfully dull Shrek the Third did.
0.625 doesn't do anything the previous installments hadn't already done for better or for worse
0.75 The weaknesses of the picture suggest that there really isn't anywhere else to go beyond this, but as long as they stop now, the series can always be remembered as a pleasurable one.
0.5 It's a Shrek-derful Midlife Crisis
0.625 All the edge, all the wit, all the refreshing originality that made the earlier films in the franchise so enjoyable have been all but drained from the swamp this go round.
0.625 The winking nonstop pop-culture references are as annoying as ever, but the witch army is cool, and there's no denying that Donkey, Puss in Boots, the Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio and the other supporting characters are pretty funny.
0.375 It cuts back on the rapid-fire pop culture references that dominate the other films to focus on the story, but unfortunately, the story isn't all that interesting.
0.625 This is one grim fairy tale.
0.5 Time for Shrek to stay far, far away.
0.6 I got three solid laughs and one chuckle out of the whole thing. There is something wrong with that.
0.5 Not as bad as number three but not as good as one and two.
0.25 A dumbed-down ripoff strictly for the tyke demographic too young to notice that the flick's a thinly-veiled retread.
0.75 After the original spoof of fairy tales and Disney fare, it's taken three sequels to finally get one right. Now please stop.
1.0 The deepest, richest, most entertaining and the most "real" characters in movies aren't real people.
0.5 The fairy tale that has charmed adults and children is now in its fourth, and possibly final, installment.
0.875 Reminds us why we fell in love with these characters, while also finding different ways for them to interact in a new adventure.
0.8 After seeing 'Shrek the Third' I thought I was done with this movies. I thought wrong. They brought back the story. And now they can put the series to bed, happily ever after.
0.5 [Its] primary function will be to serve as a babysitter once it hits DVD.
0.582 Somewhat clever, heartfelt and much darker than its predecessors, but it's ultimately forgettable and not nearly as diverting as it could have been for kids and adults simultaneously.
0.5 [It] may not be especially funny; it may not have any tremendously compelling reason to exist... but by God, it's not as dispiriting as Shrek the Third.
0.6 Shrek Forever After is not that bad. That's what we've come to... evaluating a multi-million dollar summer tent-pole release as 'not that bad.'
0.8 You don't have to be a second coming of Albert Einstein to figure out how it will all end, but that doesn't stop Shrek Forever After from having a tremendous amount of heart.
0.6 Fiona's fierce, Shrek's lovable in still-funny 4th movie.
0.625 It's no classic, but Shrek Forever After is a pleasant reminder that every time a cash register rings, this ogre turns angelic.
0.5 It feels narratively overcooked and comically undernourished, a pale shadow of the earlier entries.
0.6 This latest episode may be agreeably snappy and snarky -- improving considerably on 2007's stale Shrek the Third -- but it's also evidence the series is out of ideas.
0.625 Shrek Forever After wanders far, far away from the infectious and propulsive zing that we've come to expect over the past nine years.
0.75 The shout line on the Shrek Forever After poster says it best: It ain't ogre till it's ogre.
0.75 Directed with zest by Mike Mitchell (from a script by Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke) and shot in 3D, this final Shrek sequel has plenty of verve.
0.9 Director Mike Mitchell and screenwriters Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke, all relatively new to the franchise, manage to lead the winning returning cast in a fresh direction.
0.55 Do we really need a movie about SHREK's midlife crisis? Really?
0.5 Forever After feels like a tired yank on the udders of a cash cow that's nearly dry.
0.625 Shrek still mopes around too much. But he recovers nicely with a good bit of help from his friends, Donkey and Puss, as fine a pair of sidekicks as filmdom has produced.
0.6 Mr. Murphy's toothy, shifty-eyed Donkey who distills the series' attitude of cheerfully curdled hipness. In his eternal upbeat cheekiness, he is a creation to rival Peter Pan.
0.5 Even though Forever After is not as fresh-seeming as its predecessors, it provides passable entertainment, especially for the kids who won't be familiar with the George Bailey storyline retread -- or midlife crises, for that matter.
0.75 Shrek's "It's A Wonderful Life," plus lots of action and Donkey teeth in 3-D.
0.75 Let Shrek Forever After be the final Shrek chapter so the franchise can end on a reasonably high note.
0.625 "Shrek Forever After" lacks the charm and freshness of the original. It does entertain, though, because of its winning recipe of popular characters, humor and storytelling.
0.8 Where Shrek the Third got a bit green around the gills, this latest take, puffed up in 3D and defibrillated back to life with a snappy story, makes for some monstrously good fun.
0.5 "It's mildly entertaining, infused with the pleasant nostalgia you experience visiting friends you only get to see every few years. ... But the laughs aren't there anymore."
0.4 This is nothing more than a tired and creatively bankrupt attempt to further stretch out a property that never should have turned into a franchise in the first place.
0.625 The fourth Shrek runs out of steam from the start, cribbing from its predecessors in a last desperate attempt to evoke some of that old magic.
0.5 If you had a tough time getting through Shrek the Third, you'll probably have an even tougher time with Shrek Forever After. Oh, but it's in 3-D. That should make things pop, but it didn't make much of an impression, sort of like the rest of the animati
0.6 ...for once, the creators of this creaky series try something new and fresh.
0.875 They ought to be happy they found a way to go out on top with a good movie. Please don't follow through with the idea of doing a 5th Shrek movie.
0.75 After a disappointing third outing, this Shrek brings the cycle of fairy-tale-themed films to a fine finish.
0.5 Benjamin Franklin once said, "Fish and guests stink after three days." The same could be said of movie franchises that overstay their welcome. With Shrek Forever After, the magic is gone but at least the heart is back.
0.25 After the frantic spurt of fairy-tale allusions and jokes in the first three Shreks, this one inches along with a few mostly pointless action scenes and the occasional mild pun.
0.875 Fresh, funny and, for once, a sequel worthy of summer blockbuster status.
0.75 A sunny, sweet and satisfying animated comedy.
0.6 Shrek Forever After is an improvement on the third film but misses that comedic balance that the first two films delivered.
0.75 For once ... I hope the filmmakers haven't ruled out another sequel. As Shrek Forever After proves, there's life in the big green guy yet.
0.625 What saves Shrek Forever After from utter mediocrity isn't its high-priced superstar voice talent but veteran animator Dohrn, who steals the show by making Rumplestilskin the best oily runt since Danny DeVito last dispatched a taxi.
0.6 Fanciful and, hopefully, franchise-concluding, it should have a long and prosperous life on dvd.
0.6 You've seen Shrek and it was good. If you want to know what Shrek would be like if it wasn't good, then see Shrek Forever After.
0.625 The series exits (hopefully) on the right note. It's not because it comes close to the achievement of the first two films ... but because it gets out before we turn from amused detachment to fed-up annoyance.
0.625 So fear not, "Shrek Forever After" is not a S-wreck. But unfortunately it's not S-great, either.
0.8 The magic is back
0.625 It now requires nothing less than the retroactive destruction of Shreka(TM)s idyllic family life to inject some necessary conflict back into the franchise. If you cana(TM)t fix something that isna(TM)t broke, your only recourse is to break it.
0.625 In the fourth and ostensibly final installment, Shrek and company still have some appeal, but the energy is lacking and the fun feels forced.
0.5 Having seen Shrek Forever After only four days ago, it has already begun to slowly fade from memory, whereas the original remains fresh in my mind, as if it were just viewed yesterday. What does that tell you?
0.625 It's the characters that pull us in when familiarity flatlines our interest.
1.0 ... that rare sequel that actually tops the original ...
0.75 Shrek Forever After ends (presumably) the Shrek saga on an up note, thanks to a fresh take on a classic plot twist.
0.5 With the exception of the third film, this is the least funny of the bunch.
0.5 Shrek Forever After is being billed as the last of four big-screen romps featuring the lovable slime-green ogre with the cheesy Scottish accent. And to see this final installment is to know: It's time.
0.5 The magic is gone. Like its watermelon-headed hero, Shrek Forever After has the midlife blahs.
0.75 As It's a Wonderful Life knock-offs go, this one isn't half-bad.
0.6 For the most part the screenwriters never lose sight of the moral of this story: Whatever else gets tossed into the mix, Shrek must be the heart and soul. In this, Myers is a master; he makes it seem easy being green.
0.625 All of this would be extremely irritating, and easy to dismiss as cynical manipulation of the moviegoing public -- except for the fact that even recycled Shrek is still pretty funny, and that kids will thoroughly enjoy it.
0.4 The kind of commercially mandated, creatively bankrupt effort that makes you realize why so many animated sequels go straight to DVD.
0.625 The quick wit and multitiered pop-culture referencing that made the inaugural Shrek so much fun doesn't feel so quick or multi almost a decade down the line.
0.6 A delightful animated portrait of Shrek's mid-life crisis and his struggle to find a way to savor the ordinary rhythms of marriage and parenting.
0.6 The novelty may have worn off, but Shrek Forever After gets better as it goes along, and it has its moments.
0.6 People will complain about what Shrek Forever After lacks in comparison to the other three installments, but I will take a drastic reduction in fart jokes and bad puns in favor of some heart any day of the week.
0.75 ...as fun and witty as its predecessors, but the movie has a completely different reason for being.
0.3 The Shrek franchise has officially gone green: Forever After is made from entirely recycled material, and it smells to high heaven.
0.25 If the screaming kids in the theater don't get to you, then the not-too-jolly green ogre's three burping, farting, and also screaming offspring will...
0.5 Forever After isn't as jumbled and irritating as 2007's Shrek the Third, but it's still decidedly pointless.
0.6 The fourth -- and allegedly final -- installment of the 'Shrek' franchise is an improvement over the third, but it won't make us clamor for a fifth.
0.5 Dreamworks seems bored with the ogre who laid the golden egg.
0.5 Shrek the Third made more than $322 million. Why kill the goose that laid the golden egg? Because it's time.
0.4 Third times are rarely charms in the movies, much less fourth go-rounds, and it takes more than ho-hum 3-D and video-game-ready action sequences to liven up diminishing returns.
0.75 The first summer movie thus far to deliver on its promise to put on a good show.
0.8 Happily, it's a move that revives our aging ogre, and renews his flagging franchise.
0.875 You can see the ending, and even the fantastically corny final line coming the whole time, but when they finally do they still hit hard.
0.5 Shrek Forever After isn't offensive, just innocuous and unnecessary, a supposed final chapter to a series that should have ended two installments ago.
0.9 Shrek is without question the funniest film of the year-at least so far.
0.5 Good enough for the kiddies, but grown-ups may find Part 4 little more than a hollow echo of the original Shrek.
1.0 Burton's modern fairytale has an almost palpably personal feel: it is told gently, subtly and with infinite sympathy for an outsider who charms the locals but then inadvertently arouses their baser instincts.
1.0 ...perhaps the cinema's most enchanting parable about the misunderstood and alienated artist.
1.0 Fine performances all around, particularly from Depp and the immensely sympathetic Wiest.
0.9 Visually, stylistically and emotionally stunning.
1.0 [Burton and Depp] seem to bring out the best in each other.
0.75 Burton's movies are fairytales for retarding evolution.
0.8 His gothic tones always mask a feeling of wonder and an endearing love for everything that is possible in life and death
0.6 Burton's sweet Gothic fairy tale has lost none of its charm.
0.8 Johnny Depp and Tim Burton in magical collaboration.
0.6 Moody and bizarre modern fairytale that works on a number of levels.
1.0 Definitely one of Burton's masterpieces, maybe THE one.
1.0 A modern fairy tale about a deformed outsider whose innocence and gentle nature make him a freak in the eyes of the community he visits.
0.6 A poetic outing by Burton with Depp offering one of his initial outsider performances. Still fun to watch.
0.7 Mr. Burton invests awe-inspiring ingenuity into the process of reinventing something very small.
0.75 Especially rewarding for those who would like to see something different in a film.
1.0 Tim Burton's finest achievement. It has an emotional wallop to go with his visual wizardry.
1.0 Probably Tim Burton's best film. Certainly his most moving.
1.0 A film you can't help but love...
0.6 Burton has a good central premise working here, but he never really grabs us...
0.5 Burton has not yet found the storytelling and character-building strength to go along with his pictorial flair.
0.9 One of my favorite films ... and one that touches me deeply.
0.75 Johnny Depp is excellent as the Chaplinesque title character and the support cast is good too.
0.83 An engaging film, one which falls early in director Tim Burton's career, helping to highlight a remarkable decade's run of moody, quirky and goofy films.
0.5 ...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
0.6 (Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory.
0.875 A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
0.8 ('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag.
0.375 We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and &#8210; upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex &#8210; can say with certitude that it isn't pretty.
0.625 The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory.
0.95 Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
0.7 Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in.
0.6 On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition.
0.75 The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night.
0.4 Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes.
0.75 Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
0.8 Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman.
0.75 Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe.
0.8 A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
1.0 At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made.
0.6 The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed.
0.6 For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun.
0.625 Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before.
0.85 The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much.
0.6 Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered
0.6 Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel.
0.8 Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film.
0.75 [Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on "Age of Ultron," he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's "The Avengers."
0.6 The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem.
1.0 If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is.
0.6 This is indisputably a sequel in just about every sense of the word: bigger, louder, sillier (and not always in a good way), more ambitious and, alas, less satisfying than the film that came before it.
1.0 Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed.
0.75 A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
0.6 Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie.
0.7 The Avengers return in an epic adventure with a little romance and tragedy to keep the spectacle grounded.
0.625 The thing's a behemoth. And as the franchise thunders on, it's also becoming more and more a bore.
0.5 [The sequel] has drained most of the joy, fun, and life out of these characters.
0.6 As much as you admire the polished, expertly choreographed entertainment...you feel as if they're putting on a gymnastics display or an extremely high-tech tap-dance routine.
0.1 When this finally ended I had an appreciation for how it feels to be unjustly convicted of a crime...and be released after 10 years when it was discovered you were not guilty. Sure, it feels good to be free, but who's going to give you back your time?
0.8 Not everything about Age of Ultron works... But long stretches of it are as good as anything Marvel Studios has produced, suggesting a bolder, more ambitious vision for the studio going forward.
0.9 It exemplifies what Marvel has always done, which is make the superhuman more human.
0.6 A Marvel blockbuster with more human touches than usual for this kind of fare.
0.75 It's to Whedon's credit that, among all the fighting and property damage, he makes just enough time to focus on the personal lives of some of his characters, but not so much that the movie gets bogged down by it.
0.625 There's still a thrill in seeing all of these comic book characters together in a movie. Even when it's just Ulysses Klaw.
0.625 Age of Ultron disappoints not because it's irredeemably bad but because it fails to achieve the level of its predecessor in nearly every facet.
0.625 The basic gist is easy enough to follow, even if most of the battle scenes, shot in a barrage of quick cuts and extreme close-ups, feel like watching a rugby match from inside the ball.
0.625 That Ultron's vocal delivery packs in more fun and personality than the other characters tells us that "Ultron" misfires on more than one metaphorical gas-injected cylinder.
0.75 With Marvel's universe expanding and intertwining at an ever increasing rate, "Age of Ultron" feels less like a sequel than a cosmic event.
0.8 Whedon is as interested in how the team works under stress as he is in the way pavement cracks under the collective weight of the Hulk and Stark's Hulkbuster armor.
0.75 As before, the greatest fun is in watching the original Avengers, all fine actors who've made the characters their own.
0.75 "Age of Ultron" has self-aware laughs, grandiose themes and the best effects that money can buy. But at this point, it will take true vision to plot the umpteen sequels without getting trapped in a time loop.
0.625 As he did in the first "Avengers," writer-director Joss Whedon avoids the fatal trap of comic-book self-seriousness, leavening a baggy, busy, overpopulated story with zippy one-liners, quippy asides and an overarching tone of jaunty good fun.
0.75 Spader is so charismatic, so purely, quietly and wittily nasty, that he provides a welcome contrast to the rote wisecracking of our heroes, who are so busy trying to one-up each others' punchlines that they are beginning to come off like "Avengers' 11."
0.8 Joss Whedon again works out a way to make world-destroying forces colloquial, keeping the humanity in superhumans. Because of that humanism-it's a pessimistic film, certain that the sun is setting on the human race-Ultron works as mammoth entertainment.
0.8 More bloated, but bolder than its predecessor, Avengers: Age of Ultron is every bit the 11th entry in Marvel's winning, world-dominating formula.
0.72 It's one you're going to want to see because when it shines, it shines bright, but Avengers: Age of Ultron is just a little worrying that the universe is already buckling under its own weight.
0.375 ...the film starts out attempting to question the Avengers' place in the world and whether they really make a difference, only to forget to probe for an answer not long after the asking.
0.625 There is a significant lack of that human touch in Age of Ultron's very fabric, where the winning personalities of its core superheroes feel diminished, defeated and consumed by whatever algorithm keeps these movies going.
0.5 Joss Whedon has said that he's walking away from the Marvel universe after this, and after seeing Ultron, it makes sense; from the looks of things, this movie killed him.
0.8 ...a comic book movie, to be sure, but it's got enough spectacle, wit, and talent on display to make it a most entertaining kickoff to the season.
0.7 Age of Ultron can be a little unwieldy, but when it works, it works really well.
0.625 An entertaining package of characters and ideas that manages to be a whole lot more than the first film while also being a little bit less.
0.2 Like the worst superhero movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron often feels like not-very-bright kids playing with action toys, holding them up by the ankles and making them fight or kiss or feud at whim and at length.
0.875 Sometimes the super-heroism is just brightly colored junk food. And sometimes, it's a way of giving us a glimpse of how we flawed, messed-up, occasionally monstrous humans can sometimes prove ourselves worthy.
1.0 It feels as if this comic book franchise has become a never-ending cinema story. If future films are as well realized as Ultron, that's fine by me.
0.75 Avengers: Age of Ultron may be very similar to the original film, but that's ok, for it still results in an equally thrilling ride.
0.625 The climactic act of "Age of Ultron" is full of colossal ka-booms and special effects, but it also has heft and reason and a bass-note of emotion.
0.75 It's a little overstuffed and a little overlong. One thing it's not, even a little, is disappointing.
0.4 Darker than its predecessor [and] far less witty ... Whereas Stark seemed to dominate the first film, here the emphasis is ... Hawkeye and Black Widow ... a negative in the case of Hawkeye and a huge positive in the case of Black Widow.
0.75 Age of Ultron is all rush and sensation with little substance. But what a feeling.
0.5 Ultron is too full, of action and CGI, while also being nearly empty of genuine thrills. A talented cast impresses throughout, but the action ultimately overwhelms it.
0.4 Whedon is mostly up to the task of keeping all his balls in the air, though he's not above using some glib speechmaking and ridiculous action to divert your attention and keep your questions at bay.
0.25 "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is supercharged and lifeless, frenetic and stone-cold dead, a barrage of action scenes that look fake, yet make you wonder if fake is the new real.
0.7 Avengers: Age of Ultron has its problems, but on a visceral, pure enjoyment level audiences are going to walk away more than pleased.
0.5 An inferior sequel that brings little joy to its grandiosity, "Avengers: Age of Ultron" carries the vague aroma of uninspired, box-checking functionality.
0.6 An enjoyable, full-sensory superhero romp, it delivers no less than what one would expect from an Avengers film. At the same time, it delivers no more than that,either.
0.9 "Avengers: Age of Ultron" brings the best of all the Marvel worlds for the first explosive superhero thrill-ride of the year.
0.6 Spectacularly overstuffed - it's more spectacle than substance.
0.8 Joss Whedon and his heroes and villains epic offers more this time around -- more characters, more plot points, more action -- and a few reasons for concern.
0.625 Still light and funny, but the novelty's worn off, and the bloat and repetition are starting to show
0.7 There is much to like about "The Avengers: Age of Ultron." There was much to love about "The Avengers," and therein lies the difference.
0.5 Writing and directing "Avengers: Age of Ultron," Joss Whedon proves he has a superpower of his own: mediocrity.
0.5 Age of Ultron is a Western about military service: it's a call to arms to protect American values like the family and the home from East European types and electronic threats to security systems.
0.8 [I] loved most of the exchanges between the characters. Appreciated the Avengers' attempts to avoid destruction in population centers. The action scenes were very exciting and clever, but I had trouble keeping up with the visuals.
0.625 Sure, this is the A Team of comic book superstars, but overextended sequences don't make them any more impressive.
0.625 Joss Whedon shows his considerable gifts for multicharacter air traffic control in a massive 3-D spectacle while demonstrating reserves of insouciance.
0.6 Ultron is slyly funny. And it manages to balance this sort of comedy (I hooted when the Hulk listens to Maria Callas on headphones) with the tendency towards the sort of whacko-labyrinthine operatic complexity inherent in comic books.
0.7 No one can quibble with the efforts of the actors. Marvel cast well, and continues to expand their parts or add fascinating new players.
0.6 Everything [Whedon] did so well on the first meeting of these Marvel comic book creations he achieves once again, which makes for a movie both enjoyable and somewhat repetitive.
0.75 "Age of Ultron" proves that a movie with stealth fighter jets, levitating cities and Hulk-on-robot fisticuffs can be as freewheeling as a no-budget indie.
0.625 Entertaining as much of "Avengers 2" is, especially when it's just hanging out with the gang in between scuffles (the "Guardians of the Galaxy" lesson, learned), Whedon's picture meets expectations without exceeding them.
0.5 Thin on story, crowded with characters and padded with extraneous action. In other words, a sure hit!
0.625 Most of these characters are great fun, and there are still stories to tell. So why not do it, instead of telling and retelling the same tale, only bigger?
0.5 A lot of movie, where not a lot is special.
0.625 The film struggles against the rigid formula that typifies the Marvel universe, but only does so up to a point.
0.65 Its problems may not have been so evident if it wasn't trying so hard to surpass the far better movies that preceded it.
0.75 Pure, uncut comic-book fantasy...Whedon tames the beast into something spectacularly epic, if a bit exhausting: bursting with destructive mayhem but grounded by interesting character beats, rife with dark implications but seasoned with good humor.
0.2 At times it feels like it's a few handfuls of terrific actors away from being a 'Transformers' entry.
0.75 It aims to please. And, for the most part, this superhero extravaganza hits the bull's-eye with all the precision of Jeremy Renner's arrow-slinging Hawkeye.
0.8 "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a kinetic, wicked mix of muscle and magic. Look no further if you want a world of superpowered freaks and geeks.
0.4 Having bent the world to his will, Whedon, a modest and self-deprecating talent, has helped Marvel unleash a form of spectacle-laden blockbuster that, unfortunately, seems intent on obliterating what he does best.
0.6 Whedon may still be a maverick but the Marvel behemoth proves an ever more levelling corporate force.
0.84 The chemistry amongst our heroes is once again terrific to watch, and the action sequences deliver both thrills and laughs.
0.6 It suffers from a bit of Transformersitis in laying on the action and effects too thick this time. The thrill may be gone in seeing these comic book icons together but the banter between them still works and it does have its moments of sheer fun.
0.875 Whedon takes a few wrong turns, creating a jumble when the action gets too thick. But he recovers like a pro, devising a spectacle that's epic in every sense of the word.
0.8 No one needs to be told if he, or even she, likes superhero movies. If you like them at all, you'll adore Avengers: Age of Ultron.
0.8 Avengers: Age Of Ultron is smart, nimble and recognises that the one way to make yet more scenes of mass destruction involving is to give the story behind them a little heart.
1.0 Proves an action movie can have it all: smart without being convoluted, flashy without being shallow, fun without being hollow, and exciting without being dumb.
0.8 Despite a densely packed script chock-full of leading characters, there's rarely a moment where one is underplayed or ignored.
0.8 Although there are some longeurs when Whedon feels bound to plot a pathway to Marvel's next tranche of potential blockbusters, the witty repartee between stars at ease in their superhero skin leavens the odd lull.
0.6 When ten-cylinder push comes to jet-propelled shove, Whedon knows his audience, and supplies the required fireworks.
0.6 Whedon wastes no time teaming them up for a blistering opening sequence that is thrilling. Unfortunately that segment is a high point in a film that swiftly becomes an exercise in ever-diminishing returns bar a few moments.
0.7 The fact that Marvel announced its entire slate a few months back takes a lot of the impact away. If we didn't know about a Black Panther film, the mention of Wakanda would have been mind-blowing. Instead, it fell flat.
0.6 The film-makers' understandable inability to take their own material seriously has now pushed the project beyond gentle parody and into broad pastiche.
0.625 The movie's action sequences and sequel-baiting suck up much of its oxygen, and the magnitude of battles dwarf the smaller moments.
0.8 Filled with plenty of laughs, great spectacle, and more cool characters than you can poke Loki's sceptre at.
0.6 Even though moviegoers looking for nonstop action will get their wish, Avengers: Age of Ultron is really at its best when it's focusing on the characters.
0.8 It's hard not to admire how efficiently and enjoyably the myriad elements have been threaded together; Age of Ultron is a suitably well-oiled machine with an insatiable appetite for family friendly destruction.
0.3 A $250 million pile of poo.
0.8 Avengers: Age of Ultron is a perfect example of the kind of crowd-pleasing blockbuster that audiences expect in this day and age, though I don't think it will achieve classic-status like the first film.
0.9 Whedon weaves theses titanic characters and egos together to bind the bloated universe into a Long Island Iced Tea; the more you savour, the more you come to appreciate all the powerful and seemingly conflicting elements and motivations working together.
0.8 The symphony of destruction works because this blockbuster behemoth has an actual soul.
0.5 Avengers: Age of Ultron, is a letdown -- entertaining to a degree, but so overstuffed that it may mark the point of diminishing returns for the Marvel movies generally.
0.8 You'd be surprised how much slack you'll cut a film that features superheroes gently ribbing one another for 142 minutes.
0.8 Fortunately, returning director Joss Whedon understands how to craft a superhero movie just as well as Marvel knows how to sell one.
0.8 Avengers: Age of Ultron delivers the usual superhero suspects in a slick, if overlong, adventure that bungee jumps between banter and action.
0.6 Whedon brings a depth and wit to his storytelling that you will never find in a Transformers movie. Even so, the final showdown is a little anti-climactic.
0.8 A welcome return of the Avengers amusing team dynamic and essentially asking "what more could you want?"
0.8 An entertaining compromise. Overloaded, but the execution of intimate character moments shine in what's essentially a bridging film
0.4 Avengers: Age of Ultron plays like an obligation, a box to be checked off on a list before all parties move onto the things they really want to do.
0.86 Ultimately, Avengers: Age of Ultron can't recapture the charm and majesty of seeing Earth's Mightiest Heroes assembled for the first time. That said, it's still a lot of fun and offers plenty of great action and character moments.
0.8 The result is a lot of everything, but the film never feels overcrowded: in fact, it's the interplay between the film's many different characters, rather than the blow-up-the-world crisis they're trying to defuse, that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
0.8 It's a superhero cavalcade of energy and fun.
0.8 Bigger and, yes, darker than the first, this is less air-punchingly gleeful but probably more consistent.
0.8 There's a lot to like about Age of Ultron, but the coolest thing about it is the way it reclaims the comic book part of the phrase 'comic-book movie.'
0.8 It ticks all the boxes for a summer blockbuster but you feel spandex fatigue is just being to creep into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
0.8 There is so much going on in Avengers: Age of Ultron ... it feels like a minor miracle that not only the film makes sense, but that it's also somehow enjoyable.
0.8 Anchored by Whedon's trademark wit without becoming a tiresome zinger-fest, it's a thrilling and affable slice of impeccably crafted chaos.
0.74 As gargantuan as blockbusters come ... doubles down on action, sarcasm, and reference-heavy plot.
0.6 It has a definite mid-season feel to it, telling a compelling but never game-changing story while laying the foundations for the epic, two-part Infinity War due in 2018.
0.8 Massive, immersive and wildly entertaining, Age of Ultron gets the gang back together for a globe-trotting battle against a meager villain. Fun will be had by all.
0.8 Improves on its predecessor on many fronts even if it doesn't fully recapture the magic of the 2012 endeavour.
0.8 Age of Ultron [is] one of the most thoughtfully driven monster vehicles you are likely to see in a summer rammed with powerful, glossy, mechanised beasts.
0.75 A gooey plate of nachos that shouldn't constitute your whole diet, but is perfectly enjoyable for now, even when as congeals at the end into a wet, sloppy mess.
1.0 It is likely that this is the best Avengers movie that we'll ever see.
0.625 James Spader, another living, breathing reason we need a special award for voice work and casting at the Oscars because he was just the perfect choice for everything that Ultron had to offer and performed it incredibly.
0.8 The stakes on the line in this action adventure are not only sky-high but soul-deep. Whedon hits both points with an almighty wallop, resulting in a large canvas blockbuster that is as epic as it is profound.
0.8 Earth versus Heaven is always an interesting conflict, but it's seldom looked so beautiful.
0.75 a visually extravagant, exhilarating explosion of animation that makes absolutely no sense
0.75 The spectacular artwork and animation go a long way toward keeping the audience captivated.
0.5 In a movie that is deadly serious, the stilted dialog provides unexpected sources of mirth.
0.75 Visual splendor does not entirely make up for failures in plotting and characterization.
0.5 Interstellar is a frustratingly flawed film that reaches for the stars but winds up lost in space.
0.875 Interstellar is chockablock with philosophical ideas, visual effects and theoretical physics from Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, who co-wrote the script.
0.4 For all the themes intended to rocket our minds into a futuristic escape plan, it's too overloaded with hopelessness and bent logic to get off the ground.
0.75 Nolan is one of the few directors with the ambition to tackle big topics -- like the fate of humanity or our need to explore -- and the artistic clout to bring that vision to a mass audience.
0.2 There are many words to describe Interstellar. Entertainment isn't one of them.
0.5 This sort of hammering, a determination that you'll "get it", distracts from Interstellar's effort to transport.
0.625 While it definitely feels as though Nolan over-reached and under-edited, there's enough eye candy and emotion to keep you from being bored.
0.5 Watching Nolan's latest attempt to create something artistic, intelligent and entertaining on such a massive scale, I couldn't help but think that with "Interstellar," he's outsmarted himself.
0.75 "Interstellar" is flawed, but has the kind of scope that makes going to movies fun.
0.6 McConaughey and his co-stars do a terrific job of underplaying the tech-nobabble and selling their individual moments... and Nolan's trademark big-picture confidence propels Interstellar through its near-three-hour running time with breathless style.
0.625 You go in to Interstellar hoping to be mind-blown, thrilled, and smartened-up. Although it's beautifully made, brainy and sometimes insanely gorgeous, you may find yourself wondering what the big whoop was all about.
0.875 It's an enthralling, provocative, ambitious film.
0.8 Interstellar's themes are universal and some of the dialogue really resonates too.
0.6 I learnt a lot about wormholes and, while I can be entranced by the idea of saving the human race, I want a little bit of drama to go with it.
0.9 This is not only a tremendously exciting space adventure... It's also a rich and thoughtful meditation on time and space and gravity.
0.625 That the universe contains phenomena eons beyond us while at the same time intimately close is a beautiful concept and Interstellar seeks to orchestrate its own moment of revelation.
0.875 Interstellar is a visual feast that explores the universe and an intimate drama that explores why love and devotion are qualities that make the human race worth saving.
0.87 There's a certain clumsiness to Nolan's longest and most personal film, a kind of earnest self-seriousness that opens it to parody and snark. But at its center beats a human heart.
0.75 It's a fairly s----y science-fiction movie, but as a metaphor for love it's kind of great.
1.0 Jessica Chastain deserves Best Supporting Actress consideration for her work. One of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.
1.0 A remarkable achievement in filmmaking that will have you on the edge of your seat
0.8 Despite some awkward pacing, easy sentimentality, and pandering it's still hard to resist. It's not just Nolan's ambition that should be admired. He actually pulls off scene after scene of unforgettable drama in colossal scale, both in space and on Earth.
0.5 After the first hour, with its poignant depiction of humanity's decline, Interstellar always seems to be rebuilding its momentum, offering plenty to think about but little to hold on to.
0.67 Ultimately, Interstellar shoots for the stars but barely gets us past the soundstage.
0.75 The sentimentality and Hollywoodized convenience of the storytelling prevent this mostly admirable film from achieving the escape velocities of Kubrick or Tarkovsky.
0.5 It's a film I didn't exactly enjoy and can't say I would recommend. And yet as an event, as a singular movie-watching opportunity, it's undoubtedly worthwhile.
0.625 nothing if not grandly ambitious, and while that ambition is certainly admirable, especially in an industry choking on increasingly interchangeable big-budget franchises and starving for original ideas, it is also part of the film's downfall.
0.8 A combination of spectacular special effects, marginal physics and grindingly slow treacle, McConaughey pulls this one out of the fire.
0.75 The movie is complex and maddening, filled with concepts over the heads of most mere mortals, yet grounded in barely enough humanity to stimulate our senses.
0.6 Some of what ensues in a galaxy far, far away is gripping, but other sequences are prosaic.
0.8 Interstellar contains its fair share of heart-in-mouth moments, the previously untapped corners of space providing ample opportunity to mine fresh spectacle.
0.8 The pace is gripping, the central performances compelling and the action sequences thrilling.
0.6 Good special effects and acting but I didn't understand one bit of the plot. It is all Geek to me.
0.7 The spectacle is far more satisfying than the story ... Gorgeous, infuriating, exciting, confusing, stirring, boring, it's the film that's got it all! Totally worth your twenty bucks. Whether it's worth three hours of your time will be up to you.
0.7 There's something weirdly touching about the movie's corny proclamations, because they contrast so sharply with the hell scapes Nolan keeps showing us.
0.8 With Interstellar, Nolan builds on the high-concept blockbuster template forged so impressively by his 2010 work Inception.
0.75 The spirit of exploration and discovery lives in Interstellar and that alone makes it a cinematic trip worth taking.
0.6 An unsatisfying blend of Gravity, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris and The Collected Poems Of Dylan Thomas.
1.0 Even more mind-blowing than his 'Inception,' Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar' emphasizes the importance of love in a science-fiction tale.
0.7 If a movie is outsized in its ambitions to an absurd, awe-inspiring degree, how much credit does it get for only making it, oh, 75 percent of the way there?
0.75 It's an experience.
0.5 Cornpone existentialism ... Overlong, talky and, depending on the crisis, either dopey or pretentious ... a New Age-y, fuzzy-headed sci-fi'er that borrows liberally from Kubrick, 'Contact' and Nolan's own "Inception."
0.9 This is probably the most audacious science fiction film anyone has ever made or even tried to make.
0.9 'Interstellar' is really great science fiction. It tugs at our heartstrings while exploring our humanity, and at the same time it blows our minds with the wonders and complexities of intergalactic space travel.
0.5 I'm not too proud to admit I couldn't follow the convoluted storyline... Think, a remake of Gravity with a bunch of polysyllabic brainiacs borrowed from The Big Bang Theory.
0.9 What makes Interstellar one of the best, most enthralling, intelligent and moving science-fiction films of modern cinema is not so much the inter-galactic journey it takes you on as the emotional journey.
0.7 The general feeling I'm left with after seeing Interstellar (is) a sensation of indecision.
0.6 Heartfelt Story, Great Visuals, Science Overkill
0.75 It's deeply flawed but also wholly absorbing, and it marks Nolan as one of our most ambitious, go-for-broke directors, unafraid to attempt Sistine Chapel ceilings while his fellow filmmakers are working with Crayolas.
1.0 The combination of NO green screen, incredible practical effects, Zimmer's score and a solid emotional core makes this Nolan's most complete flick to date. I had major nerd tears! See in 70mm IMAX film!
0.8 Christopher Nolan can do whatever the hell he likes. He's earned that right now. And if he uses that clout for films like Interstellar, we all win.
0.7 Its strengths are as gargantuan and overpowering as its mighty flaws, and just as impossible to miss.
0.6 This film is meant to be Nolan's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but he's tilting at windmills here. Still, Interstellar is worth seeing.
0.8 For all its sci-fi trappings...Interstellar comes down to one thing, and one thing alone: the notion of following your heart. Yes, it really is that simple.
0.8 The film is confident enough to take us on a thrilling adventure witho ut resorting to huge action sequences, in which the spectacle is delivered on an intergalactic scale, but from a very human point of view.
0.6 Ambitious intergalactic drama focuses on a father's promise.
0.875 Not Christopher Nolan's best film by a long shot, yet also proof that 'not Christopher Nolan's best film' is still better and more thrilling than many directors' finest work.
0.7 Interstellar is an imaginative movie, but a heavy-handed mix of personal sacrifice and theoretical physics doesn't leave much room for subtle storytelling.
0.75 In Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, sci-fi fans are treated to a true cinematic anomaly: an impeccably crafted slice of escapism driven by scientific concepts that fascinate and thrill in equal measure.
0.8 Marrying the brains of "Inception" with the epic splendor of "The Dark Knight," Christopher Nolan's "Interstellar" asks vastly important brain-scratching questions, inspires your forward thinking and treats you to one hell of a mind-altering thrill ride.
1.0 Interstellar is a marvel of congruency from the opening shot to the final frame.
0.625 Nolan's Vision Exceeds his Grasp.
0.7 Nolan lays out a narrative path between Odysseus, Albert Einstein and Buck Rogers, then paints it with bold cinematic brushstrokes inspired by the masters-Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg, John Ford.
0.8 This majestic film retains a human heart.
0.8 It is dazzling to look at, properly intelligent, and, when you can follow what's going on, profoundly thought-provoking.
0.8 Christopher Nolan's movie about time has time troubles of its own. It's too long and drags to a convoluted climax. However, getting there is riveting and worth the trip.
0.8 While it has some problems, Nolan aims higher than most filmmakers would dare attempt and comes oh so close to creating another undeniably classic space masterpiece.
1.0 Forget about what it means and just go for the mind blowing, heart wrenching ride.
0.625 Lacking a sense of awe or of the astronomic passage of time, "Interstellar" provokes more "huh?" moments than it does "ah!" moments.
0.8 Interstellar is sufficiently grand and challenging to bear comparison with those two touchstones of mind-bending epic sci-fi: Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Tarkovsky's Solaris.
0.6 Interstellar is beautiful, dazzling and astonishingly loud, but, alas, it is remains something of a mess at the level of the script
0.85 Interstellar must be seen in a movie theater because of how powerful it is visually. It is audibly the best film to be released in theaters this year. But you can't help but feel like it's all slightly too convoluted for its own good.
0.8 Christopher Nolan outdoes himself with this thrilling , and emotionally moving. sci-fi drama that has echoes of 2001 but carves out its own gripping story by smartly focusing on the human element so often missing in this genre.
0.6 Nolan creates overwhelming, often breathtaking suspense in a number of sequences.
0.6 Uma obra inquestionavelmente problematica.
0.875 What the neg-heads are missing about Interstellar is how enthralling it is, how gracefully it blends the cosmic and the intimate, how deftly Nolan explores the infinite in the smallest human details.
0.875 A science-fiction (heavy on science) adventure steeped in Einstein's theory of relativity that is equal parts enigmatic, exhilarating, elaborate and emotionally wrenching.
0.75 A thought experiment writ large.
0.6 Boldly swinging for the rafters and face-planting half the time, [Nolan is] uncharacteristically willing to embarrass himself here. There's a lot to admire in that.
0.7 Brainy blockbuster maestro Christopher Nolan heads into deep space with this epic adventure, which is packed with thoughtful ideas and big emotions even if the plot wobbles badly in the middle.
1.0 Nolan has created nothing less than his own personal 2001: A Space Odyssey, a mind-expanding, imagination-challenging excursion into alternate galaxies where we skip through the fourth dimension and plunge headlong into the fifth.
0.75 You never know what's coming in Interstellar. It stokes and maintains a sense of anticipation often missing in Hollywood blockbusters intent on being formulaic and thus global audience-friendly.
0.5 In space no-one can you hear you scream, but they can certainly see you cry. Never before have I seen more blubbering in a movie than director Christopher Nolan's Interstellar.
0.6 There is something exciting about a film that tries to fill your mind and then blow it, even if it's only filling you full of hot air.
0.8 Christopher Nolan's epic is visually stunning and offers some ingenious ideas on time and space as it plays on our darkest fears about the end of life on Earth.
0.4 Interstellar surprises you with a high ratio of scenes of people sitting around tables (sometimes on board spaceships) to moments of flight or danger.
0.75 You thought Gravity was an immersive lost-in-space experience? Just you wait.
0.5 What many had hoped would be Christopher Nolan's 2001: A Space Odyssey is, instead, 2014: An Exposition Odyssey.
0.75 Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic is a beautiful, ambitious, ultimately flawed film about nothing less than the survival of the human race.
0.75 A grandiose, audacious, exciting, sentimental, impassioned, philosophical, metaphysical, dense, epic mess. And you probably need to see it.
0.6 Interstellar is terrible, wonderful, sensational, thrilling, imbecilic. In any order you want.
0.625 If only the plot and the corny, exposition-heavy dialogue - where characters speak in fortune cookie - could hold up to the cinematography.
0.6 The film's self-seriousness is, in fact, its great ally: the conviction with which Nolan directs prevents us questioning the absurdity as it unfolds.
1.0 In the age of shopping-centre cinema, Christopher Nolan builds cathedrals.
1.0 ... it's the best science fiction movie you're likely to see this year, and quite possibly one of the best films period.
0.5 ...way too long...The first two hours are tolerable, but the ending requires an advanced degree in theoretical physics to understand, and even then I would think it would be ludicrous.
0.8 The most brilliant editing of the year revs you up as it interlaces the apex of story lines, and then explodes into a giant orgasm of emotional and physical movie making only to roll over, light a cigarette and stop paying attention to you.
0.6 Interstellar can be pretty fun when it wants to be. The trouble is, 'fun' has never been atop director Christopher Nolan's list of priorities.
1.0 Never has a nearly-three-hour blockbuster enthralled me in the way that Interstellar did.
0.5 Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is desperately reaching for Stanley Kubrick 2001 greatness and achieving Robert Zemeckis mediocrity in Contact. It's no small bit of irony that both films star Matthew McConaughey and his southern drawl.
0.6 Interstellar may be a blockbuster spectacle but it's also a puzzle that bends the laws of space and time to create different kinds of links between images, like Nolan's early hit Memento or Shane Carruth's recent Upstream Colour.
0.8 Interstellar is not perfect, but it's the bold, electrifying and provocative cinema with rocket scientist smarts and a sentimental heart.
0.75 Illustrious of vision but even grander of ideas, "Interstellar" is majestic science-fiction done right. Mostly.
0.625 By the closing credits, it seems possible that Nolan himself hails from another planet, and while he has tried diligently to show humanity in a flattering light, he lacks enough inside information to get it right.
0.7 The film is at its best when it's unafraid of challenging storytelling, particularly since Interstellar never has trouble finding visuals to match its heady concepts.
0.75 It's almost impossible to resist recommending Interstellar, but it's equally tough to deny a galactic sense of disappointment.
0.9 A roller-coaster for the mind and spirit... Twenty years from now we may think of it as a classic, even if it takes a bit of time for it to sink in.
0.75 This isn't Nolan's best movie, but his ambitions and trust in the audience keep getting bigger. He's one of Hollywood's few true remaining visionaries, and he's only getting warmed up.
0.625 Love is what's really between the stars, y'all.
0.6 [Nolan's] new picture is his biggest: biggest event, biggest spectacle, biggest pastiche, biggest disappointment.
0.5 Twice as long as Gravity and half as good.
0.4 From the grand master of films about the mysteries of human nature, a disappointing exploration of family, science, and human survival.
0.875 That's the essential question facing the viewer, whether Nolan's mission is a success because it takes us farther than most filmmakers could, or a disappointment because it doesn't quite make it all the way.
0.65 ...a unique film to be sure, and one that is probably best experienced on the largest screen available.
0.75 It's ambitious and not entirely successful but there is a lot to like about "Interstellar."
0.5 For a movie about transcending all manner of dimensions, "Interstellar" ultimately falls surprisingly flat.
0.5 Even a cool cat like Christopher Nolan can cough up a furball - and with his sci-fi adventure Interstellar, it's blockbuster-sized.
0.7 Nolan has always been a director who loves big, big ideas, but one occasionally gets the sense that he would almost rather make a movie of the characters explaining those ideas to one another with flow charts and diagrams.
0.75 The parts of Interstellar that don't work -- a third act (out of four) that descends into suspense-movie silliness, an increasing reliance on mystical mumbo-jumbo -- struggle against the many parts that do.
0.75 While it's not a perfect movie by any means, it's a grand accomplishment of sorts.
0.6 What good is that adventurous spirit if Nolan doesn't trust the audience enough to see it through to the end?
1.0 It's rare for a film to deliver a scene of such emotional power that the hardened critic is fighting back tears. It's even less common for a celluloid image to have that effect. Interstellar does both.
0.8 All the talk of Kubrick and 2001 is light years off the mark: Interstellar is the kind of space odyssey that has only shameless, monolothic entertainment on the agenda.
0.8 The movie sucks you into its orbit and promptly shuttles you to the event horizon of the unknown, where the only thing you can really do is appreciate the scenery and hang on for the bumpy ride.
1.0 It's an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. Nolan has crafted Interstellar as a movie theater experience. Watching it at home, no matter how good the sound system is, won't match.
0.75 A knockout one minute, a punch-drunk crazy film the next, Interstellar is a highly stimulating mess.
0.75 "Interstellar" may not be Nolan at his best, but it's still Nolan, and there's much to be said for that.
0.875 This is epic cinema that begs to be compared to "2001: A Space Odyssey." But unlike Stanley Kubrick's psychedelic joyride, this journey is powered by a human heart.
0.5 If your interest in prolonged discussions of the space-time continuum fades, composer Hans Zimmer will boost the already booming organ soundtrack up to 12.
0.75 Interstellar is an experience. Nolan's vision of our galaxy, and galaxies beyond, is daunting, majestic; the hardware of space travel looks right, almost familiar.
0.5 I think I saw a kitchen sink flying through space.
0.875 [T]his is a film with the weight of space, time, and humanity on its shoulders. It is unafraid of stumbling and soldiers forward with the conviction of its audacity.
0.9 Interstellar is the most ambitious, intelligent and daring space epic since Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey.
0.5 Despite its many virtues, Interstellar feels as if it doesn't quite hit the target.
0.7 The film offers grand visuals, including a bizarre-beautiful key scene in a location I couldn't describe if I wanted to.
0.8 Christopher Nolan's film, about a trip to deep space to find a habitable place for humans to live, doesn't always live up to its ambition, but then again, its ambition is huge.
0.4 To this point, I have enjoyed many of Nolan's films but Interstellar's script is terribly inconsistent.
0.375 Shows that long doesn't mean epic and serious doesn't mean deep.
0.9 An intellectual and technical feat, this undeniably ambitious Christopher Nolan movie reaches for the stars and reaches them more often than not.
0.9 It may not be the best movie of the year, but it surely is the most breathtaking.
0.6 With Interstellar, Christopher Nolan has fallen into a trap that has caught many before him: the pitfalls of autonomy.
0.8 Audaciously ambitious and awesome, it's a speculative, mind-bending sci-fi adventure through the celestial space-time continuum.
0.6 It's far from Christopher Nolan's best work, but those rare moments when Interstellar is firing on all cylinders make up for its often inert characters and shaky sentimental storytelling.
0.5 Much like his hero, Christopher Nolan's goal seems to be to take the humor and wildness out of imagination, to see invention in rigidly practical and scientific terms.
1.0 A soulful, must-see masterpiece, one of the most exhilarating film experiences so far this century.
0.6 Even as "Interstellar" becomes a beautiful mess, its wannabe-deep impact will hit everyone differently. We need far-reaching artists like Nolan, since, as they say, Earth without art is "eh."
0.625 "Interstellar" deserves credit for aiming for the stars, but the hard realities of filmmaking and storytelling pull it right back to Earth.
0.875 The most intellectually ambitious sci-fi film since "2001."
0.875 An impressive, at times astonishing work, and one of a handful by Nolan that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to his work melted away.
0.7 INTERSTELLAR might not be Nolan's best film, but it's certainly his most ambitious.
0.6 This is a long film that's constantly worried about time passing, but it's not self aware enough to turn that into a joke
0.9 For a film completely drenched with sentimentality about faith, hope and human-kind's resolve, "Interstellar" is at times as cold and lifeless as a vacuum.
0.75 It's not only full of great visuals and big ideas (albeit ones that are sometimes a little confusingly expressed) but that it's a movie about human perseverance.
0.8 The final stretch may be just a little too hard to swallow. But fans of smart, spectacular sci-fi will still gulp down this astonishing trip through the cosmos.
0.8 Space in your face. Beautiful, beautiful space. An awe inspiring journey across the cosmos that travels to the heart of humanity; flaws and all.
0.8 Dramatically awkward and visually ravishing -- often within the same sequence -- Interstellar is director Christopher Nolan's ninth and most ambitious film to date.
0.6 As space operas go, this may yet be accounted one of the classics: dream material even.
0.875 Whereas most science fiction withers out in space, "Interstellar" rockets home.
0.8 Watching Christopher Nolan fall short is still more exciting than watching most other directors succeed.
0.8 Packs a mighty emotional wallop to make it as much a stirring experience, as it is a visually and intellectually stimulating one.
0.8 Nolan's complex story, his most visually pleasing genre piece and arguably his most complex film to date.
1.0 Brainy, barmy and beautiful to behold, this is Stephen Hawking's Star Trek: a mind-bending opera of space and time with a soul wrapped up in all the science.
0.8 Nolan reaches for the stars in spectacular fashion, delivering a mesmerising sci-fi epic that, despite a testing running time and few too many flights of fancy, is grounded by an on-form McConaughey.
0.6 The vaulting ambition and shoot-for-the-stars bravery of this latest film from the director of The Dark Knight and Inception is to be admired, but its attempt to cover life, the universe and everything in nearly three hours is rather enervating.
0.5 Nolan's aesthetically beautiful, large-scale sci-fi drama is admirable in its ideas and style, but lacking in its storytelling and execution.
0.8 Interstellar is an imperfect film, but like its central characters, aims about as high as one can. The ambition, execution, and craftsmanship are all to be admired.
0.75 The story is ever-ambitious, sometimes riveting and thought-provoking, but also plodding and hokey and not as visionary as its cutting-edge special effects.
0.6 Not every film need address the possibility of human extinction with the gung-ho silliness of Armageddon, but at least that was a space adventure. This is a science report.
0.8 Nolan thrives in the limbo between logic and emotion.
0.8 It combines abstruse ideas about gravity, matter and time with old fashioned, hyper-charged family melodrama.
0.6 Interstellar would be a stunning piece of cinema if you weren't supposed to think about it.
0.8 What pulls you in is its hugely confident architecture as a piece of storytelling - its brave fictitiousness. Nolan comes very close here, one might almost say agonisingly close, to forging his masterpiece.
0.8 A spine-tingling blend of brains and heart, a high concept sci-fi opera that's as unafraid of cerebral ideas as it is of heart-on-sleeve emotion.
0.85 Nolan's love letter to space travel and the exploration of the stars may require some patience, but it offers an incredible emotional payoff along with its visual spectacle.
0.5 Interstellar is not quite a success. I can't insult those involved by grading on an admiration-based curve.
0.875 A masterful sleek vision of the future, Nolan's epic is a vigorously entertaining piece that stands as one of the best experiences of the year. Immersive, but admittedly overwhelming at times, Nolan controls the film with confidence.
1.0 A bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike.
0.8 Extraterrestrial comes out of left field with characteristic charm and unexpected plotlines, but it delights nonetheless.
0.5 On the whole, Extraterrestrial is slight, filled with lots of bark but little bite.
0.6 It's easy to settle in for the oddball charms of this tale of love among the ruins.
0.625 Even though it's not entirely successful, there is an undeniably oddball charm on display.
0.4 A tiresome roundelay of lies, lust and leaping paranoia.
0.625 As comedies go, it's as dry as bleached bones in the desert, but you can't blame Vigalondo for taking another shot at cleverness.
0.6 Quirky, but infinitely more interesting than big-budget Hollywood cousins.
0.875 In almost every respect, Extraterrestrial is an exceptional and traditional romantic comedy. It just happens to be set during an alien invasion.
0.6 It is a comedy written for an adult audience that does not pander to an "adult" audience.
0.7 Alien invasion aficionados would do well to avoid but if you're a fan of the comedy of discomfort with a slacker vibe and a hint of romance, Extraterrestrial certainly has charms.
0.375 Extraterrestrial is, in the final analysis, nothing short of a disaster.
0.6 This is buoyant, bright, a constant breeze. But still it hovers somewhere on the superhero-adap spectrum between the good and the great.
0.8 In an exemplary piece of casting, Downey Jr gives a powerhouse performance, adding depth and believability to his character as both self-indulgent waster and do-gooder superhero.
0.9 A grand superhero movie that features a brilliant performance by Robert Downey Jr., in one of his best roles.
0.8 Iron Man is funny without being silly, yet can kick ass to the moon and back when the chips are down.
0.8 As a first franchise entry and a blockbuster to kick off the summer season, Iron Man proves to be an excellent introduction.
0.6 If this is a taster for something even more impressive in the sequel touted for 2010, there is already a reason to get excited as the more we see of Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark, the better.
0.8 A completely different superhero movie which not only delights visually, but also engrosses with a very well adapted, character driven story of a redemptive figure who becomes the ultimate global hero.
0.78 If anyone doubted Marvel's ability to make the leap to full fledged studio, their first effort, Iron Man, should be enough to erase all doubts.
0.6 Iron Man is an appealing superhero movie. It's also clunky. It's welded together out of disparate pieces that clank and ping. Though at times it's leaden, Iron Man also has enough moments of pizazz to intermittently soar.
0.8 The story is so rich and complex that Favreau is going to have a near-impossible task of outdoing himself with the inevitable sequel.
0.75 Not only is it a good comic book movie (smart and stupid, stirring and silly, intimate and spectacular), it's winning enough to engage even those who've never cared much for comic books or the movies they spawn. Like me.
0.8 ...who'd have thought that a successful superhero film could be more about character than action?
0.7 Iron Man is the best superhero film to come along since Batman Begins, and is one hell of a way to start off summer of 2008.
0.7 Une production a grand deploiement executant une formule bien etablie, mais avec un savoir-faire indeniable et un enthousiasme contagieux
0.9 The pace is good, not frantic, not "oh god we have to get to the explosions or we're gonna lose them" %u2013 and the actors are all above average at least. (Our leads are no strangers to the Oscar nomination process.)
0.875 One of the strongest entries into the superhero movie canon of recent years. While featuring a few flaws, this is one of the most entertaining comic book adaptations in last few years.
0.75 The visual effects are bound to give you goosebumps and maybe you'll find yourself uttering an audible "whoa."
0.9 The bottom line is this: the movie works. It works extremely well and it does so because of Downey.
0.75 Visual sizzle, top actors and a witty script, yet it could have been so much better if only it didn't try to cobble together a pacifist warrior.
1.0 At the end of the day it's Robert Downey Jr. who powers the lift-off separating this from most other superhero movies.
0.8 "Iron Man"'s true revelation is leading man Robert Downey, Jr., who may not be giving the greatest superhero performance ever, but is certainly the best actor to ever portray a superhero.
0.9 This may not be what the Academy has in mind when it's considering the Oscar worthy performances but Downey finds the reality of being a superhero and makes us buy into that. Final verdict: Iron Man is cool and Downey is hot.
0.68 Ironman is great fun, but it could've been better. And judging by interviews with director Jon Favreau the sequel sounds like it'll be a corker.
0.7 Downey imbues this superhero with a heart that glows as radiantly as the power reactor implants in his chest.
0.5 Hoping to blend comic book superhero thrills ... with the relevance of the real war-torn world, 'Iron Man,' directed by Jon Favreau, fails at both endeavors.
1.0 It's easily the best Marvel film, and quite possibly the best superhero film I have ever seen!!!
0.8 The brillance of Downey's performance is that Tony Stark is more of an impenetrable, unstoppable force than Iron Man.
1.0 Get your popcorn ready! Iron Man is the perfect start to the summer movie season.
0.85 Latest Theory of Flight: This film is politically smart, action-packed, sexy and fun. High-flying suit notwithstanding, this newest entry in the superhero arena has just raised the bar.
0.875 An adventure that you'll want to go on over and over...
0.8 "Iron Man" is highly entertaining and well made, and when I say highly entertaining and well made, I mean it's almost in the same league as "Batman Begins," "Spider-Man 2," "Superman Returns" and "X-Men 2." Hard to believe, but yes, it is that good.
0.6 If you can get past the irony (or hypocrisy) of the central concept Jon Favreau's adaptation is reasonably entertaining and uses its digital effects energetically.
0.875 While the movie is technically a marvel, it would have been an empty shell without the strong turn from Downey Jr. Wonderfully sarcastic and hedonistic early on, his transformation from capitalist to hero is logical because of the sincerity the actor inv
1.0 Iron Man is a thrilling ride full of excitement and laughs. Finally this year we have a great family film that everyone will enjoy.
1.0 This is hands down the best super hero/comic book movie I have ever seen!
0.875 Director Jon Favreau displays the same wonderment and control over visual effects as he did in 2005's underrated "Zathura." Excepting a clunky prologue and escape sequence, it's a flawlessly paced origin story with humor, smarts and soul.
0.8 This is awful! I'm just kidding...it's really good, and Downey, Jr. is perfect for the part.
0.6 Un pasatiempo entretenido que prioriza el desarrollo de una historia y de un personaje por sobre el mero despliegue de accion y efectos visuales. Robert Downey Jr. es un perfecto Tony Stark.
0.8 ...great fun, thanks mainly to the power of the original Marvel Comics concept...
0.875 Exciting, but the message is mixed: Stark's creation of Iron Man affirms rather than repudiates his arms race-exploiting past -- it proves once again that the one with the best weapons wins.
0.5 ...suffers from an uneven and increasingly oppressive structure that ultimately negates the film's few positive attributes...
0.875 'Iron Man' is not only action packed, as expected, but it is also laced with a story that has substance and with some wit and romance added to please all ages.
0.5 Garden-variety pop heroism/wish-fulfillment marinated in Robert Downey Jr.'s effortless insouciant sauce.
0.75 Just as Stark needs a device to keep his heart pumping, Iron Man requires Downey's presence to keep the heart of this franchise alive.
0.8 Iron Man has its flaws, but they're not enough to keep the film from being a good time at the movies.
0.8 An exciting, quick-witted adventure built to entertain.
0.7 To counter the character's relatively low Q-rating among the non-fanboy masses, Paramount has jacked up the f/x budget and made some interesting casting choices...
0.8 Move over, Superman. This lush, high-octane playboy never tasted so good. Iron Man has not only etched itself the mark of one of the best-reviewed films so far in 2008 but also one of the highest-rated superhero movies of all time.
0.6 Given everything that it does right, it is somewhat disappointing that Iron Man doesn't quite fly to the stratosphere.
0.7 o Iron Man, analafra diaskedastiko kai gargara synarpastiko prototypo eperhomenoy poly-iroa, shedon aggizontas tis eksarseis gamatosynis ton Transformers (2007) se stigmes, einai o,ti kalytero tha mporoyse na anoiksei to horo ton kalokairinon ypertheamato
0.9 Iron Man is what mainstream, big screen entertainment ought to be like.
0.8 He's not as limber as Spider-Man once was, or as darkly compelling as Batman is yet to be, but Iron Man comes with his own enjoyable strengths and weaknesses in a fun film that also has a point of view.
1.0 Favreau has turned what might have been just another comic strip formulation into a completely engaging amalgam of storytelling, romance, performance, acrobatics and organically motivated effects.
0.6 Too slow on the take off
0.875 Robert Downey, Jr. is an unusually good leading man ... and has great comic timing in this movie.
0.875 Even for a starting point, Favreau gives us what we came to see and this is a true accomplishment for general movie goers and most importantly: We comic book geeks...
1.0 A 'Marvel'-ously cerebral superhero with a functioning conscience.
0.6 It's supposed to be fun, and it is, in spots.
0.6 Fun summer blockbuster
0.875 This might be the most relevant superhero tale we have yet seen.
0.875 Robert Downey Jr. delivers a knockout performance that alone is worth the price of admission to watch.
1.0 'Iron Man' has several advantages over a lot of recent efforts in the superhero genre. It features a solid cast, snappy dialogue, some pleasant surprises, expectedly impressive special effects and even a hint of subtle social commentary. But most importan
0.8 Representando uma surpresa tao grande quanto a escalacao de Robert Downey Jr. como heroi de acao, o cineasta Jon Favreau se revela uma aposta bem sucedida da Marvel.
0.875 a thrilling, innovative and enormously entertaining movie that just may be the coolest AND smartest superhero adventure of them all.
0.9 It's Robert Downey Jr., having triumphed over his substance abuse battle, who puts the pedal to the metal and scores the freshest new franchise going.
0.625 Iron Man ... is really a four-act play in a three-act movie.
0.7 Something that everyone needs to know before they set foot in the theater: STAY AFTER THE CLOSING CREDITS. BEST BONUS SCENE EVER.
1.0 Cooooool!
0.85 The best superhero movie since Spider-Man 2. Robert Downey Jr is the film's best special effect.
0.75 In the second half, when the red-and-gold suit does the heavy lifting (sometimes literally), Iron Man stops being a great blockbuster and settles for being merely a good one.
0.875 The film nevertheless makes the crucial decision to set its story in the real world, to have its characters face real moral decisions with real consequences. And then, when Iron Man does show up for battle, this flick just soars.
0.875 Iron Man is an action sci-fi blockbuster extravaganza that provides cartoon thrills for thinking people. It's the best movie of its kind since the second Spider-Man movie four years ago.
0.75 Action scenes in comic-book films? Overrated. That's the lesson of Iron Man, which goes light on CGI fireworks but heavy enough on its most electrifying element -- Robert Downey Jr. -- to compensate.
0.8 Actually feels like a classic comic book: fast, furious and flip. Forget about superheroes with love problems and tortured souls.
0.875 Directed with joyful verve and a nice pinch of cultural nerve by Jon Favreau, Iron Man reinvigorates hope in the joys of the summer movie. It is simple a" and not so simple a" fun.
0.625 Downey could have taken a tragic tack. But he has fun just figuring out how to make the armor suit work. His sarcasm and almost drunken Tony Curtis body language transform the scenes of Iron Man.
0.875 Doubters with their tales of suspense about whether or not Iron Man will fly as a franchise can finally calm down -- and Batman and Spider-Man fans can start to get edgy about sharing the cinematic spotlight.
1.0 While Iron Man has never ranked among the most iconic of American superheroes, Downey's brilliantly nuanced performance as a hedonist in the grip of a midlife crisis might change that.
0.6 A superhero flick with the message that an arms dealer can see the light and give up the business of making a profit on the death of others.
0.75 Iron Man forges a new trail subsequent superhero films would be wise to follow.
0.9 ...a machine with a human heart, a gleaming vehicle of transport.
0.4 Despite the convulsively jittery address to the role, [Downey] is never in the smallest degree engaging in the way director Jon Favreau appears to think.
0.8 Is it summer already? The first of the big budget superhero blockbusters has arrived, and it's a roaring success, thanks to a combination of superb special effects and canny casting.
0.7 Let the Summer Games begin! Fun, entertaining and emboldened with broad appeal, this first foray into the summer blockbuster blitzkrieg will not disappoint.
0.75 ...a slam-bang kickoff to the blockbuster movie season...
0.6 There is precious little comedy and even less characterisation.
0.9 In the proficient hands of Jon Favreau, abetted by a magnificent performance by Robert Downey, Jr., not only does Iron Man pay off, but it raises the stakes for comic book movies to follow, as well as the entire summer film season.
0.75 What sets the movie apart ... is that ... it is not bogged down with the "with great power comes great responsibility" mantra that weighs upon other costumed crusaders.
0.75 Dangerously dependant on Robert Downey Jr. for entertainment. He throws a one-man party during every scene. But when he's off-screen, the film wilts. (Yes, even with Jeff Bridges' anti-Dude.) Re-cast, it would only be a shade better than Daredevil.
0.9 Iron Man is fantastic, a sure fire blockbuster that will leave audiences breathless and fanboys wanting more.
0.75 Favreau fully respects the material, and brings to the table a highly developed sense of humor and--praise the heavens--taste. [Blu-ray]
0.625 Its thin script suggests that the movie is more interested in setting up a franchise than entertaining us, which it does do sporadically.
0.875 ... lives up to its promise and premise... the benchmark for this summer's blockbusters has just been set.
0.6 Fulfills all the requirements of its genre admirably, but never rises beyond the level of baseline satisfaction.
0.9 While not perfect, it comes pretty damn close - Iron Man is one of the best superhero movie adaptations to hit the big screen so far.
0.8 A slightly-better-than-average popcorn epic featuring a performance from Downey that is so funny and inventive and entertaining that he pretty much winds up carrying the entire movie on his shoulders.
0.8 It's as if someone snuck a hefty slug of bourbon into your cherry cola; all of the sugar and flavor and fizz you expect from a well-made comic-book movie are there, but there's something a little more grown-up going on behind them.
0.7 a solid, well-crafted launch for what should be a lucrative franchise.
0.8 Iron Man is terrific. Full of explosions, one-liners, and nifty special effects, it goes the extra mile of casting Robert Downey, Jr., one of the best actors working today, in the title role
0.875 This exciting, enthralling action-thriller is certainly the best comic book-based movie since the second Spider-Man film.
0.75 After 2003's Elf and 2005's Zathura, Favreau has now made three smart, family-friendly, high-concept popcorn movies.
0.875 Iron Man gives the summer movie season a smashing start.
0.9 You'll believe a (iron) man can fly in 'Iron Man,' the undisputed movie to beat this summer season.
0.75 Robert Downey, Jr.'s effortlessly nuanced performance as Tony Stark is a dark delight that combines pop-culture wit and genuine emotional depth.
0.75 Favreau trumps last year's clunky Transformers with his smooth, almost musical footage of Iron Man's armor and its thousands of pieces clicking into place.
0.75 A largely satisfying summer entertainment blending brains and geekiness in equal measure.
0.9 This is lotsa fun!
0.8 It's this balance between real world stakes and superhero surrealism that makes Favreau's film such a success.
0.875 Jon Favreau has directed Iron Man with a wit and intelligence to match Downey's.
0.75 The payoff of casting Downey is as big as the risk. He's not in the movie, he owns it in a way that makes it hard to imagine without him.
0.75 A witty and dapper speeding bullet of a film, able to appeal to nerds and civilians alike.
0.75 [It's] an absolute blast to watch, a consummate piece of popcorn entertainment made with wit and class, and it leaves you so pumped for a sequel that it is practically guaranteed to become a huge hit. The bar for the summer movie season has been set.
0.6 It's fantastic to see a superhero movie getting away from the navel-gazing to serve up overboard action with a knowing sense of humour.
0.8 Everything a summer movie should be, and more.
0.75 Iron Man is fresh and fast enough to remind you of why you liked comics to begin with.
0.8 It is light, rather than heavy metal, marked by invigorating war-machine FX and a smart and subtle acting performance, at least by the standards of this genre.
0.8 The movie rises and falls on the strength of Downey, and it rises pretty high.
0.875 One of the hippest, best-written and best-directed superhero movies ever -- a splendid way to kick off the summer movie season.
0.75 It breaks no new ground, but it plows the old ground vigorously.
0.5 Downey's unbeatable charisma makes these problems less troublesome than they would be otherwise, but wouldn't it be nice if they didn't exist at all?
0.75 Hollywood has unearthed an unlikely weapon of mass destruction: Robert Downey Jr.
0.75 Downey's richly human performance as a reformed rake who relies on his intelligence, feels both personal and genuinely fresh.
0.875 There's no rust on the first blockbuster of summer '08: Iron Man is an ironclad cinch to be a hit.
1.0 Iron Man is simply great escapism. It deserves to be the first blockbuster of the summer.
0.7 Frontloaded, [but] boasts a great look, abundant humor, and Robert Downey Jr. making the case for middle-aged, flawed superheroes.
0.875 Easily the best superhero film since "Batman Begins," which for my money is the best in the genre.
0.875 Downey absolutely owns this role. He's pitch perfect as Stark, infusing the character with more personality and comedic one-liners than there ever were in the comics.
0.875 Like every path to success, there is an origin story and Iron Man ranks as one of the most instantaneously satisfying of all of them.
0.7 When an action blockbuster comes along that actually bothers to create lively, memorable characters, you don't want to miss it.
0.8 This is everything you could possibly want from a superhero movie.
0.875 ...should make anyone who went gaga over Transformers finally understand why those metal emperors wore no clothes.
0.875 Fan boys looking for an action and special effects-filled popcorn spectacle will be thrilled by "Iron Man's" pyrotechnic treats. Discriminating audiences hoping for a film that features more acting than action will also be thrilled by the casting of Rober
0.625 The film is at its best when reveling in Downey's gift for letting bon mots dryly roll off his tongue, as well as his effortless blend of hedonistic insouciance and resolute intensity.
0.625 Not quite memorable enough to live up to the top superhero films but proficient enough to be satisfying, Iron Man suggests with a clever ending that better things are yet to come.
0.875 Iron Man kicks off summer on a blazing high note and practically dares the competition to measure up.
0.875 Fast, funny and deliriously entertaining.
0.75 Despite several adrenaline-pumping moments, Favreau and Downey stay focused on the real story -- about a man learning to take responsibility for his actions. For all its firepower and CGI slickness, that's what really makes Iron Man fly.
0.875 This is one summer blockbuster that succeeds on brains, not bombast.
0.875 Mainly it has Robert Downey Jr. The newly insurable actor, who has had his run-ins with various chemicals in the past, plays this louche playboy with a knowing glint in his eye."
0.75 Seeing Downey and Bridges duel is one of the film's primary delights.
0.7 Bloodied but unbowed, wounded but walking, Downey Jr.'s sly take on Marvel Comics' cold warrior Iron Man elevates everything about this film.
0.875 Over the years, there have been only a handful of exceptional superhero movies, and Iron Man is among them.

0.9 Easily the best Marvel Comics based movie yet -- Favreau, Downey and company have really nailed this one!
0.75 Saddled with a fairly typical superhero "origin story", director Jon Favreau compensates with some inspired choices: keeping the pace as fast as possible and casting Robert Downey Jr. as the man behind the mask.
0.7 Kudos to Iron Man for finding novel twists on an exhausted genre.
0.8 Iron Man is a lot of fun, especially for a superhero origin story, since they so often end up going awry.
0.9 Mr. Downey delivers the best popcorn flick performance since Johnny Depp first played pirate.
0.7 For Marvel, whose recent string of missteps have left fans doubting the comic giant, Iron Man is an excellent return to form and the likely start of another successful franchise.
0.6 In place is a talented cast, an interesting director, an established lead character, and a wealth of plots from the comics ready to be mined for future storylines. Despite Iron Man's problems, it will definitely leave you wanting more.
0.6 Light on both CGI and moral quandaries, [it posesses] neither the zip and sparkle of a Spider-Man nor the brooding existential subtexts of Batman Begins.
0.6 It's not sure where to go once the final Iron Man suit is constructed, and seems in a rush to get there, but Downey Jr and the supporting cast are so perfectly placed we're already looking forward to the bound-to-be-better sequel.
0.8 A n exceptionally well-made, incredibly entertaining and -- dare I say it -- marvelous superhero movie.
0.6 Audiences looking for grand escapist fare at cinemas this summer won't mind having spent their price of admission on it. Be sure to get some popcorn too.
0.4 We are treated to superb city landscapes but so much minor detail that you never know who is doing what to whom, or even why.
0.6 It's beautifully animated - the climactic sequence in Earth orbit is breathtaking - and its philosophical digressions are fascinating, if completely bananas.
0.4 The script is lousy and laughable. Anime fans may be able to take the talky portentousness, but the ideas are ridiculous.
0.4 We're in a post-9/11 world plagued with terror attacks. Is it an American corporate conspiracy? Or the work of a deity? Cue the obligatory second-half metaphysical blather.
0.4 The cyborgs' epic search for 'His Voice' quickly becomes a little tenuous and ridiculous, pushing the film into maddening and tedious territory.
0.8 One of the most ambitious and interesting movies of the last few years.
0.6 Terrific-looking action sequences alternate with less terrific expository chat. Despite the natter, it's all mildly baffling.
0.2 Ambitious, perhaps, but hardly entertaining.
0.4 A disappointingly dated and unpowered Manga update.
1.0 Ford, with his Star Wars cachet, was Blade Runner's top-line draw, but it's Hauer's movie all the way, his shimmering "replicant" providing the tonal touchstone for Ridley Scott's severally reworked masterpiece.
1.0 This remains an astonishing achievement: a Dystopian sci-fi epic that is also one of the best film noirs of recent times.
1.0 "Blade Runner is a film set 40 years hence, made in the style of 40 years ago," Ridley Scott said of his celebrated science-fiction noir. Perhaps that other-worldly "retrofitted" look is why it seems ageless, despite being set in 2019.
1.0 Scott's visionary thriller makes the acid rain/neon-drenched Los Angeles of 2019 a far colder, more violent and depressing place.
1.0 Another chance to savour its pure unhurried strangeness, beginning with that bizarre vista of 2019 LA, with four tall buildings mysteriously belching fire-plumes into the night like apocalyptic oil rigs.
0.6 It's a quest movie - where one thing leads mechanically to another to another to another. There are no twists. It's noir only in atmosphere and expressionist lighting schemes.
1.0 The single most immersive and tactile world ever created for the cinema.
1.0 Perhaps on its deepest level, "Blade Runner" explores ... a theme as old as Genesis and the myth of Prometheus, and iterated in "Paradise Lost," Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," and in Blake's arcane, visionary mythology.
