0.6 <|###|> Really quite fun. Up to a point.
0.6 <|###|> The plot may sound fairly simplistic but underneath the blood and guts there's a biting satire about rich cosseted students signing up to causes they hardly understand.
0.625 <|###|> The Green Inferno receives a palpable shot in the arm from the characters' initial arrival into the tribe's primitive camp...
0.75 <|###|> A fun and interesting twist on the travelogue sub-genre of horror ... far better than many horror movies with twice the budget.
0.7 <|###|> A very slow start threatens to derail The Green Inferno, but once the terror begins, it never lets up and Roth once again proves why he's a master of horror.
0.7 <|###|> if you want an absolutely brutal experience that's tough to endure, just like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, this is probably the movie for you.
0.625 <|###|> It's not to say there's not a lot wrong with the film, but rather to suggest that the chief criticisms of it being strange and "a mess" aren't among them.
0.6 <|###|> An often fascinating mess, but a mess all the same.
0.25 <|###|> There's the obese Brando pretending to be God while dressed in gauzy white robes like a demented pope
0.8 <|###|> Amazingly, Kilmer delivers an odder performance than Brando. Creepy retelling.
0.5 <|###|> In its final third, the movie goes to hell in more ways than Frankenheimer intended.
0.625 <|###|> The most exciting characters are killed off too early, and what we're left with is a Satan's "Seasme Street."
0.2 <|###|> I'm sure it looked good on paper. That and Kilmer's frighteningly apt mimicry of Brando's voice are about the only positive things I can say.
0.5 <|###|> The movie keeps switching focus without ever getting its bearings, and when Brando exits earlier than expected, there's little but mayhem to fall back on.
0.8 <|###|> Uneven; definitely has its moments.
1.0 <|###|> As good as The Ring is, it can't top the original for sheer, shivering terror.
0.8 <|###|> A sure, stealthy shocker which certainly primes you for the sequel.
0.6 <|###|> David Cronenberg could perhaps compete with Nakata but unfortunately only lesser mortals have attempted to replicate the feeling that Reiko has plunged into something with which even her psychic powers can't compete.
0.8 <|###|> Ring has indescribably disturbing moments that frightened me out of my wits. But like many of the Japanese horrors that followed, it sometimes has an elliptic and confusing storytelling style that can make plot-progression muddy.
0.6 <|###|> The original retains its power to chill, although in the age of the DVD and the download, the idea of a haunted video cassette seems positively archaic.
1.0 <|###|> The finale, too, still feels as twisted, bizarre and down-right nightmarish as it did all those years ago.
0.8 <|###|> Subtly expressive faces and spooky interiors are the order of the day in this original, powerful treat.
0.8 <|###|> A landmark in horror cinema, Japan's Ring is arguably the most chilling pieces of popular supernatural cinema of the 90s.
0.4 <|###|> Bog standard horror offering with a distinct lack of action or plot.
1.0 <|###|> A blockbuster in Japan, this restrained horror film crosses urban legend conventions with Asian ghost story traditions, and the results are truly spooky.
0.9 <|###|> It hit something primal in me, turning me into a quivering ball of nerves; my 'fight or flight' switch was turned to flight and then broken off.
0.8 <|###|> It's hard to fairly judge a film like RINGU when you've seen the remake first. Many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity, [yet] are worthwhile.
0.75 <|###|> Neither inferior nor superior to the Hollywood version.
0.8 <|###|> Good ol' urban legend stuff.
0.8 <|###|> Contando com uma premissa curiosa, o filme mergulha o espectador em um clima de forte suspense, culminando em um desfecho que certamente fica na memoria.
0.8 <|###|> contrasting the original Ringu with the current Americanized adaptation is akin to comparing The Evil Dead with Evil Dead II
0.8 <|###|> If it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with Ring, an indisputably spooky film; with a screenplay to die for.
0.625 <|###|> If nothing else, this movie introduces a promising, unusual kind of psychological horror.
0.875 <|###|> Even if it's been tailor made for Japanese schoolgirls, it still had me screaming like one.
0.6 <|###|> Girlhouse is just another nudie horror flick at first glance, but a strong finale finishes things off with a bloody, satisfying moneyshot.
0.7 <|###|> Girl House is an impressive first feature for Trevor Matthews. For a slasher film, there is suitable attention to detail and a reputable level of respect for all the characters.
0.25 <|###|> Puts the porn back in "torture porn." Pity the parents of these pretty young actresses.
0.5 <|###|> Fear Clinic is an ambitious project stitched together by unsteady hands, as the threads holding everything together threaten to unravel come the film's end.
