FAIR Really quite fun. Up to a point.
FAIR The plot may sound fairly simplistic but underneath the blood and guts there's a biting satire about rich cosseted students signing up to causes they hardly understand.
FAIR The Green Inferno receives a palpable shot in the arm from the characters' initial arrival into the tribe's primitive camp...
FAIR A fun and interesting twist on the travelogue sub-genre of horror ... far better than many horror movies with twice the budget.
FAIR A very slow start threatens to derail The Green Inferno, but once the terror begins, it never lets up and Roth once again proves why he's a master of horror.
FAIR if you want an absolutely brutal experience that's tough to endure, just like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, this is probably the movie for you.
FAIR It's not to say there's not a lot wrong with the film, but rather to suggest that the chief criticisms of it being strange and "a mess" aren't among them.
FAIR An often fascinating mess, but a mess all the same.
BAD There's the obese Brando pretending to be God while dressed in gauzy white robes like a demented pope
GOOD Amazingly, Kilmer delivers an odder performance than Brando. Creepy retelling.
BAD In its final third, the movie goes to hell in more ways than Frankenheimer intended.
FAIR The most exciting characters are killed off too early, and what we're left with is a Satan's "Seasme Street."
BAD I'm sure it looked good on paper. That and Kilmer's frighteningly apt mimicry of Brando's voice are about the only positive things I can say.
BAD The movie keeps switching focus without ever getting its bearings, and when Brando exits earlier than expected, there's little but mayhem to fall back on.
GOOD Uneven; definitely has its moments.
GOOD As good as The Ring is, it can't top the original for sheer, shivering terror.
GOOD A sure, stealthy shocker which certainly primes you for the sequel.
FAIR David Cronenberg could perhaps compete with Nakata but unfortunately only lesser mortals have attempted to replicate the feeling that Reiko has plunged into something with which even her psychic powers can't compete.
GOOD Ring has indescribably disturbing moments that frightened me out of my wits. But like many of the Japanese horrors that followed, it sometimes has an elliptic and confusing storytelling style that can make plot-progression muddy.
FAIR The original retains its power to chill, although in the age of the DVD and the download, the idea of a haunted video cassette seems positively archaic.
GOOD The finale, too, still feels as twisted, bizarre and down-right nightmarish as it did all those years ago.
GOOD Subtly expressive faces and spooky interiors are the order of the day in this original, powerful treat.
GOOD A landmark in horror cinema, Japan's Ring is arguably the most chilling pieces of popular supernatural cinema of the 90s.
BAD Bog standard horror offering with a distinct lack of action or plot.
GOOD A blockbuster in Japan, this restrained horror film crosses urban legend conventions with Asian ghost story traditions, and the results are truly spooky.
GOOD It hit something primal in me, turning me into a quivering ball of nerves; my 'fight or flight' switch was turned to flight and then broken off.
GOOD It's hard to fairly judge a film like RINGU when you've seen the remake first. Many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity, [yet] are worthwhile.
FAIR Neither inferior nor superior to the Hollywood version.
GOOD Good ol' urban legend stuff.
GOOD Contando com uma premissa curiosa, o filme mergulha o espectador em um clima de forte suspense, culminando em um desfecho que certamente fica na memoria.
GOOD contrasting the original Ringu with the current Americanized adaptation is akin to comparing The Evil Dead with Evil Dead II
GOOD If it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with Ring, an indisputably spooky film; with a screenplay to die for.
FAIR If nothing else, this movie introduces a promising, unusual kind of psychological horror.
GOOD Even if it's been tailor made for Japanese schoolgirls, it still had me screaming like one.
FAIR Girlhouse is just another nudie horror flick at first glance, but a strong finale finishes things off with a bloody, satisfying moneyshot.
FAIR Girl House is an impressive first feature for Trevor Matthews. For a slasher film, there is suitable attention to detail and a reputable level of respect for all the characters.
BAD Puts the porn back in "torture porn." Pity the parents of these pretty young actresses.
BAD Fear Clinic is an ambitious project stitched together by unsteady hands, as the threads holding everything together threaten to unravel come the film's end.
BAD Laughable exploitation film results in a complete waste of time and talent.
BAD One of those movies that's a nailbiter for a little kid, but laughable when revisted as an adult.
BAD The movie swarmed into local theaters yesterday; unfortunately, the insects and the people in this melange of ersatz science-fiction and dull adventure deserve one another.
BAD Teaming Collins with ants is pure Bert I. Gordon.
BAD We interrupt this soap opera to bring you... a monster movie!
BAD Bring on the DDT. A silly giant-bug opus with cheap special effects.
BAD What's scarier: ants or Bert I. Gordon movies?
BAD If you find it when you are flipping through channels at three in the morning, turn it off and try to get some sleep.
BAD Torturous vampire bloodbath is a waste for all.
BAD A tedious Blade rip-off. No suspense or scares, but lots of boredom.
BAD While Rise: Blood Hunter isn't a terrible film, it's a predictable one.
FAIR far from perfect, but it's better than most direct-to-video horror you'll find out there. Heck, it's better than some of the theatrical releases we've seen this year
FAIR ...a far more effective piece of work than one might've expected...
BAD It's a blood-red affair thrown together in a dash, a little number that will ultimately get the same kind of treatment from audiences as it did from those who made it: something you might cue up in the DVD player on a whim and forget just as easily.
BAD A dry and dreary little affair, one that's almost shamefully beholden to B-flicks that are a lot more energetic and a lot less intent on being taken so seriously.
BAD Many scenes are set in dark parking lots and dirty city streets, but you sense the locations were chosen because they were inexpensive. There is some pleasure to be had counting continuity mistakes.
FAIR [Director] Gutierrez sustains a heightened mood of sex and violence that, without breaking new ground, entertains in the way Gothic flicks do: a combination of cheap thrills and a good old-fashioned crusade against evil.
FAIR You can thank a capable cast led by the estimable Lucy Liu, and work by writer/director Sebastian Gutierrez that succeeds in making the formulaic seem fresh.
BAD There are worse things than waking up in a morgue. Like, say, waking up and realizing there's another hour of Rise: Blood Hunter to go.
GOOD It will offend those who are offended by the very title; it will probably thrill those who take one look at the title and immediately want to see the film.
FAIR The results are uneven and occasionally mind-bogglingly bad (which is partly the point), but they're never what you'd call dull.
FAIR And what, pray tell, is the Big JC doing wasting his time helping Canadians?
GOOD The basic premise alone is worth the price of admission for this one.
BAD If you can't make me petrified of a place called the "Suicide Forest," you've got some explaining to do.
FAIR What Van Sant's film does, tremendously well, is make the material foreign again.
BAD Psycho doesn't do much for Van Sant, and he doesn't do much for Psycho.
BAD Vaughn's Norman Bates is much inferior because he lacks the natural neurosis of Anthony Perkins.
BAD The movie doesn't stink. The performances are good, potentially great, especially Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates, but he owns a scene just for doing that psychotic giggle of his.
BAD Personally, I found the remake weaker than the original (which was only vaguely interesting anyway; then again, it's pretty much the same movie).
BAD franky it sucks
FAIR Gus Vant Sant has remade Alfred Hitchcock's classic slasher film with so much reverence and so little originality that it is not clear what the point is.
FAIR It's surprising to note that this film, mostly well-acted, is somewhat lacking on the technical side, which is what Hollywood usually does best these days.
FAIR Predictably, it's (almost) the exact same film, but I wouldn't say that it's a pointless enterprise.
BAD It's not so much that this movie didn't need to be made. The real tragedy is that a group of enormously talented people wasted several months of their lives when together they could have done something fresh and exciting and original.
FAIR Gus Van Sant assumiu um trabalho ingrato: quando as cenas funcionam, em seu filme, a responsabilidade e de Hitchcock. Quando falham, a culpa e sua.
BAD An utterly empty technical achievement.
FAIR What scared audiences then will almost certainly strike kids raised on the unholy trinity of Michael, Jason and Freddy as quaint and slow.
BAD Van Sant's pseudo-Xerox is flat, mannered and often downright boring!
BAD Es mejor que las nuevas generaciones vayan a la tienda de videos y renten la version original
BAD Vince Vaughn is probably the best person you can get to fill Anthony Perkins' shoes; he can be one of America's best film stars one day, and that is evident in the way he treats his character on screen.
BAD Whereas the original was fascinating and shocking, the reconstruction is bland and lifeless.
BAD Vince Vaughn's Norman Bates is about as terrifying as a tranquilized dachshund.
FAIR Less a remake and more a scene-by-scene reconstruction, with all of the original dialogue intact.
BAD It is only because of a few elements of original creativity that Van Sant and the rest should be saved from eternal film damnation.
FAIR This gutsy cinematic experiment is more than just a curiosity. It's an intelligent homage (at times even a spoof) and still a bit of a hand-wringer, even though pop culture has spoiled all the surprises.
BAD Having all of this distinctly '60s material played out by '90s performers in living color makes for a film that feels jarringly anachronistic...
GOOD Is this film better than the original? The answer is no, not quite, but to my shock, it is just about as good of a remake as could have possibly been expected.
FAIR There's nothing exactly wrong with Vaughn's performance, which is edgy and scary. Vaughn simply can't help the fact that physically, he is completely wrong for the role.
GOOD Vaughn, from the outset, seems like a loose cannon, a nut case, a psycho. Unlike Anthony Perkins who, at first, appeared as a shy mama's boy, Vaughn adds an extra layer of menace to his Norman that renders Van Sant's film a bit a-kilter.
FAIR The one actor who stood out from the pack was definitely the rising star of the year, Vince Vaughn, who took Anthony Perkins' superb original performance, and added his own macabre touch of surrealism.
FAIR Vaughn and Heche bring energy and freshness to the parts originated by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. Heche is so good, in fact, and so frisky and watchable in her role, that after her grisly demise in the shower you miss her for a long time.
FAIR Though some hard-core fans of the original may scoff at anything that tries to compete, Van Sant's version of Psycho is actually pretty good.
FAIR Since this is a virtual shot-by-shot, line-by-line remake of the original masterpiece, it's like watching a new version of a Shakespeare play. Think about it.
FAIR ...represents a significant improvement over its lackluster predecessor...
BAD The character development is as thin as shed snakeskin.
BAD This is a film that manages to take what should have been delirious camp fun and turn it into a struggle to keep any remote interest.
BAD Provides some unintentional laughs and genuine bursts of adrenalin, however hokey it gets and however Harry Potterish the snakes.
BAD It's fun to see the characters get eaten up. It's the people who remain alive and talking that may disturb the viewer.
BAD Not especially tedious, the snakes were OK, and I understood most of the conclusion. The only surprise, though, was that I made it to the end.
BAD Obviously the cast and crew don't care that this makes no sense--they got a great holiday in Fiji.
GOOD Despite a script that borders on banality ... and Strickland's sometimes distracting emoting, director Little and director of photography Stephen F. Windon do an exceptional job of creating tension.
BAD Se vou perder uma hora e meia de minha vida vendo uma cobra comer pessoas, quero, no minimo, que a refeicao seja composta por caras conhecidas.
BAD Even if it isn't worth the price of admission, it is at least a pretension-free flick.
FAIR ...a real popcorn film...
FAIR Surprisingly, Anacondas turns out to be much more entertaining than it has any right to be.
BAD It's predictable. It's clich&#233;. But it's fun to watch.
FAIR It took four screenwriters to cobble this together. That's reasonable. With the death of Ed Wood, it's not possible for any one person to come up with anything this screwy.
FAIR ...easily the best mainstream release of the summer... an example of first-rate B moviemaking.
BAD I never thought a film about giant snakes that eat people could be this atrociously dull.
BAD At best, it will come as a pleasant surprise to those going in with the lowest of preconceptions. At worst, it offers audiences a chance to get out of the August heat for 90 minutes.
BAD When the snakes do attack, there's not much originality or surprise to their methods. No one gets spun up and down like a yo-yo, or puked back up.
BAD More snakes does not a better movie make.
FAIR If you just want to see giant snakes eating people who talk too much and need to die because of sheer stupidity, this movie is for you.
FAIR The big snake is back and he's brought along some friends.
FAIR Dwight Little directs this exciting film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
BAD As someone said, the only way you should see this is drunk.
BAD Who knew the science field was so jam-packed with beautiful people?
BAD I can appreciate a good B-movie as much as the next guy, but even by the very relaxed standards of B-moviedom, "Anacondas 2" is a rather sad affair.
BAD The kind of sequel that should have gone directly to DVD shelves.
BAD How ridiculous is this? They depend on cellphones that even work in the remote jungle.
BAD The only surprise in this unintentionally funny scarefest is learning that the characters you hope get eaten first, darn the luck, make it to the finish.
BAD Stinky cheese.
BAD Supremely silly but undeniably fun.
BAD 'There's a way in. There's a way out.' He's right. It's behind you, right below the sign that says Exit. Just follow the stampede.
FAIR Wisely prods not only ordinary phobias about big, bad serpents but also universal terrors of the dark, of narrow spaces, of drowning, of falling, of spiders and much more.
BAD The sequel might have the formula down, but it lacks everything that made Anaconda fun.
BAD Tired dud of an over-the top violent action movie.
BAD The plot is such hooey...and the plot holes so gaping that End of Days proves more exasperating than enjoyable. [Blu-Ray]
FAIR Never rises to the realm of exciting.
GOOD Part of the degraded charm of End of Days is its buffet-table derivative approach.
BAD End of Days isn't complete waste of time but all those who watch it would probably agree that this film's days were numbered long time ago.
BAD A lot of fun, but not a great movie.
FAIR Loud, lurid, bloody and ridiculously entertaining.
FAIR Um filme de acao incessante que traz Arnold Schwarzenegger em uma das piores atuacoes de sua carreira.
BAD Displaying precisely the imagination that gave the world such epic achievements as The Star Chamber and The Relic, Hyams dusts off America's designated import and goes with Arnie Schwarzenegger his own self.
BAD An effort which will join True Lies and Raw Deal in the dustbin of Schwarzenegger history.
GOOD If you liked The Exorcist, The Omen, and Rosemary's Baby , don't miss this one.
BAD Arnold, Arnold, Arnold, what were you thinking when you signed on to do this?
FAIR The biggest problem here was the script.
BAD Isn't a bad movie by any means; it's just a reasonably silly one that, in one form or the other, has been overdone to death.
BAD ...a run-of-the-mill supernatural thriller.
BAD Arnie's batteries seem to be losing their juice.
BAD The movie is as bloodless as a cyborg, and it feels as if it has been assembled according to diagrams supplied by someone who studied every successful sci-fi action thriller and then multiplied the findings by 10.
FAIR This could be devilish fun, but director / cinematographer Peter Hyams slows the action to a ponderous crawl.
BAD Nothing but groans and yawns.
BAD ...suffers from an egregiously laid-back pace that ultimately negates its few positive attributes...
BAD In the end, the script lets the film down with its obvious twists, its naggingly illogical narrative and a general pointlessness.
BAD A final reel of arterial spray splatter empties itself in record time and when Gone finally gets going, it's gone too soon.
BAD You will be kept waiting for the twist that never comes in Ringan Ledwidge's derivative psycho-thriller, whose by-the-numbers plotting is as inevitable as roadkill.
FAIR If only it had taken the characters' lead and strayed further from the beaten track...
FAIR A potentially menacing first half is let down by a few cliches in the home stretch.
BAD Gimmicky sci-fi, outer space B-flick.
BAD Very bad special effects mar this only-average s-f excursion. Only the giant rat-bat-whatever creature has any flair.
BAD They don't make 'em like this anymore. It's easy to see why.
FAIR This is just about the one-billionth movie to lampoon the horror genre, but so what? It's hilarious.
BAD Given the talent involved, it's a project that sounds promising (if maybe more than slightly derivative), but it winds up an unfortunate misfire.
BAD The jaw drops at the drought of laughs in the horror spoof "Hell Baby," especially considering the massive amount of comic talent in front of and behind the cameras.
BAD I can't say I didn't laugh during Hell Baby. I just didn't laugh as much as I would have liked to, or as much as I expected to.
BAD Certainly isn't the worst horror comedy of all time (see Transylmania)... But most of it is still pretty bad.
BAD It soon becomes apparent that the filmmakers, many of whom worked together on "The State" and "Reno 911!", aren't committed to their film's main conceit.
BAD [It] rarely dares to be smart, settling instead for familiar gags that would have the Devil himself yawning.
BAD A film that's less than half as funny as its predecessor, and a sliver as clever as the original.
BAD This offensive, crass pastiche makes "Grown Ups 2" look like a paragon of wit and good taste.
BAD Garant and Lennon's attempts at humor are absolutely terrible. It's as though they have no idea what comedy is or how it works. This results in a series of gags that they must think are hilarious, but are actually extremely sad and cringe-worthy.
FAIR In the end, the level of delirium is addictive. Getting there, however, is a challenge which may or may not be worth your time.
BAD There are genre satires, and then there are dumb comedies that wish they could qualify for that status.
FAIR Its modest (if occasionally gross-out) stabs at genre parody rarely insult our intelligence and even allow for the kind of retro deadpan silliness Mel Brooks used to underline his louder punch lines.
BAD Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon's Hell Baby is a hit-or-miss affair with far more misses than hits.
BAD When you consider that Garant and Lennon make their living as screenwriters for hire, Hell Baby's shoddy script is an unholy mystery.
FAIR The filmmakers satirize the often obscenely meaningless ways in which people of a certain socioeconomic strata attempt to launder their white guilt.
FAIR Hell Baby is a devilish laugh-riot, providing hellishly indulgent comedy married with lighthearted slapstick comedy - as long as you're into Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant's typical "immature" style.
FAIR It's genuinely funny, a condition all too rare in horror-comedies, comedies, and movies written by Lennon and Garant.
BAD Marlon Wayans' A Haunted House no longer can own the title of the worst horror spoof of 2013.
BAD For every joke that works- about ten fall flat.
FAIR It doesn't reinvent the wheel after their anarchic sketch comedy show "The State," but funny is funny, and Hell Baby is very, very funny.
