0.4 <|###|> Immaculate execution in every detail of one poor conception after another... uninspired, arrogant, and lazy.

0.6 <|###|> It's Back to the Beach writ saucy.
0.5 <|###|> It's all enjoyable enough, but it's played so broadly that it loses whatever impact it might have had.

0.9 <|###|> Not since Rocky Horror has the film world produced such a vibrant farce of teen angst, violence, and sexual deviance.
0.8 <|###|> Wonderfully campy entertainment that doesn't ask anything of its viewers.
0.8 <|###|> The sort of movie that even today's superstars might love to slum around in.
0.625 <|###|> It's best to just relax and enjoy the Party.
0.8 <|###|> It definitively skewers the false innocence of American pop culture on the eve of the countercultural deluge.
