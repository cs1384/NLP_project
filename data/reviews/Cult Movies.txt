BAD Immaculate execution in every detail of one poor conception after another... uninspired, arrogant, and lazy.
FAIR Cool original camp. This is a fun little movie.
FAIR It's Back to the Beach writ saucy.
BAD It's all enjoyable enough, but it's played so broadly that it loses whatever impact it might have had.
GOOD Sharp satire. Great fun.
FAIR A funny tongue-in-cheek comedy, cinematic commentary and murder mystery all rolled in to one.
FAIR It may be fluff, but it's knowing, relatively enjoyable fluff.
BAD It's too much filmed theater to come alive fully on the screen.
FAIR A promising recipe for comedy that goes flat in the execution.
FAIR Has a great look, but its broad laughs at the expense of '50s and '60s cultural naivete aren't really all that clever.
FAIR An enjoyable, if weightless, romp.
GOOD Not since Rocky Horror has the film world produced such a vibrant farce of teen angst, violence, and sexual deviance.
GOOD Wonderfully campy entertainment that doesn't ask anything of its viewers.
GOOD The sort of movie that even today's superstars might love to slum around in.
FAIR It's best to just relax and enjoy the Party.
GOOD It definitively skewers the false innocence of American pop culture on the eve of the countercultural deluge.
BAD Laughable exploitation film results in a complete waste of time and talent.
BAD One of those movies that's a nailbiter for a little kid, but laughable when revisted as an adult.
BAD The movie swarmed into local theaters yesterday; unfortunately, the insects and the people in this melange of ersatz science-fiction and dull adventure deserve one another.
BAD Teaming Collins with ants is pure Bert I. Gordon.
BAD We interrupt this soap opera to bring you... a monster movie!
BAD Bring on the DDT. A silly giant-bug opus with cheap special effects.
BAD What's scarier: ants or Bert I. Gordon movies?
BAD If you find it when you are flipping through channels at three in the morning, turn it off and try to get some sleep.
FAIR Gory, scary, violent sci-fi is too intense for kids.
FAIR ...boasts a tongue-in-cheek, downright campy sensibility that ultimately pervades every aspect of the proceedings.
GOOD Insanely subversive...functions as a visually dazzling science-fiction action picture, a philosophical challenge, and a hilarious, incisive comedy. [Blu-Ray]
GOOD Paul Verhoeven's satiric, 1997, sci-fi, war-movie romance is admittedly an acquired taste.
FAIR Utter stupidities and other scientific impossibilities litter the script like trooper body parts . . . [yet] the film does something right
BAD What galls me is the film's marketing, moral and ideological cynicism.
FAIR Cut Paul Verhoeven some slack!
BAD Lacking the sophistication of the average comic book, it compensates with panoramic attack sequences, reminiscent of the Japanese swarm attacks in American war movies.
FAIR Repulsively thrilling and often downright hilarious.
FAIR A jaw-dropping experience, so rigorously one-dimensional and free from even the pretense of intelligence it's hard not to be astonished and even mesmerized by what is on the screen.
BAD It's a cynical wasteland from beginning to end.
BAD A nonstop splatterfest so devoid of taste and logic that it makes even the most brainless summer blockbusters look intelligent.
BAD The enjoyment you get from watching Starship Troopers is similar to the pleasure felt from a loud 'ZAP' from a bug zapper. And about as deep.
BAD This flick wallows in just about every moth-ridden cliche known to the film industry and relies almost entirely on naked teenage girls and recycled special effects for what it deems excitement.
FAIR Not the return to form for Verhoeven many have called it -- in the end, it is just a step in the right direction.
BAD In the hands of Verhoeven, the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made, a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale.
BAD Nobody objects to a simple gross-out proposition on the big screen. But here too, Starship Troopers doesn't quite make it.
BAD The action sequences are heavily laden with special effects, but curiously joyless.
FAIR It's a sci-fi gorefest, and a fun one at that.
GOOD The battle scenes are phenomenal, both for the realistic and clever special effects and for the humor.
GOOD Intellectually, I can't really condone that message, but I have to admit that this will be a guilty pleasure of mine for years to come.
GOOD It is pure Verhoeven -- broad, brash and ultraviolent, and all up there on the screen.
FAIR Enjoyable despite the little redemption it offers humankind, Troopers fits every Hollywood convention while simultaneously breaking each one.
FAIR May just be the bug movie to end all bug movies.
GOOD Terrific entertainment.
BAD As written by Ed Neumeier, who also wrote Verhoeven's much tighter Robocop, Starship Troopers never gets over its 180-degree swivel from teen-age love story to murderous destruction.
FAIR As a brainless bubblegum movie, it's an exhilarating adrenaline rush.
FAIR Just enjoy the fun of watching Neil Patrick Harris in his audition for Apt Pupil and roll with it, baby.
FAIR This is powerful entertainment that appeals to our most basic instincts.
GOOD Manages to be both fun and shocking -- sometimes in the same shot.
GOOD Director Paul Verhoeven is back in his subversively nimble RoboCop groove with the uproariously cheeky Starship Troopers.
FAIR Flawed but fun.
BAD Gimmicky sci-fi, outer space B-flick.
BAD Very bad special effects mar this only-average s-f excursion. Only the giant rat-bat-whatever creature has any flair.
BAD They don't make 'em like this anymore. It's easy to see why.
