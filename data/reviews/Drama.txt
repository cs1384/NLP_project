0.7 <|###|> Frozen River is bleak and uncompromising - and that's just how the Academy likes it.
0.875 <|###|> Melissa Leo's Oscar-nominated performance as a mother not above illegal business, but resolutely clinging to honesty and not giving into hypocrisy, is terrific. Hope comes from hard sacrifice in a finale proving sometimes possessions are our blessings.
0.8 <|###|> Actress Melissa Leo rightly earned an Oscar nomination for her part in this downbeat drama.
0.8 <|###|> Frozen River is a taut, suspenseful thriller; a troubling of borders both cultural and national; and testament to the virtues of communion, empathy and compassion.
0.8 <|###|> Original, sad, suspenseful and involving: the kind of work that helps independent American cinema retain its good name.
0.8 <|###|> Occasionally marred by contrivance and a crude internal logic that doesn't bear close scrutiny, 'Frozen River' works best as a knuckle-gnawing, blue-collar genre thriller.
0.8 <|###|> Leo and Upham give performances of great conviction and the film is bold and uncliched: especially the matter-of-fact treatment of guns.
0.6 <|###|> It's Leo, with her pained and battered magnetism - half-pleading, half screw-you - who shakes the film out of its occasional glibness, notching up the performance of her career in thrilling, hungry style.
0.8 <|###|> Everything about the film looks and feels authentic, from the desolate landscape dotted with trailers and fast-food joints to the people who populate a borderland that offers none of them much hope.
0.8 <|###|> A fascinating, understated look at the human condition.
0.8 <|###|> Cold yet never calculating, it's a fine film featuring a heart-rendingly knockout performance of steel and strength from Leo.
0.8 <|###|> Leo and Upham make an unlikely double act in a finely written, well-played film with a striking plot and setting. Hunt's clearly a name to watch; Leo, meanwhile, can look forward to finally getting the recognition, and roles, she deserves.
0.6 <|###|> As a quiet celebration of ordinary women's resourcefulness, the film is well-crafted, sensitively acted and modestly affecting.
0.6 <|###|> While there is much to admire, there is little to enjoy as downtrodden folk try to make money the hard way. At heart it is a sentimental drama that rarely connects.
0.8 <|###|> Frozen River will penetrate your core like a biting Arctic wind.
0.8 <|###|> A modest but thrilling drama.
0.8 <|###|> Frozen River represents one of the best examples of the new trend for austerity and social realism in American indie cinema.
0.8 <|###|> The surprising twists and turns in the final act are both powerful and haunting.
0.8 <|###|> This is that rarest of beasts - an indie thriller that tries to win over viewers not with crowbarred-in whimsy but with a gripping plot and two brilliant lead characters.
0.6 <|###|> Frozen River is a quirky drama driven by a couple of outstanding performances.
1.0 <|###|> Frozen River is a superbly written, genuinely moving drama with an unmissable central performance from Melissa Leo. Highly recommended and one of the best films of the year.
0.8 <|###|> Skating between thriller and character/social drama, Hunt has created a women's movie with backbone, fleshed out by terrifically steely performances from Leo and Upham, who manage to convey the intricacy of the women's decisions despite the sparse dialogu
0.7 <|###|> It is more conventionally melodramatic than its realist postures might at first suggest, but in the end Frozen River is kept from sinking into icy oblivion by the brittle strength of its central performances.
0.8 <|###|> The film's strength lies in the utter realism and the lack of sentimentality with which the characters and situations are presented, but it runs the risk of being so uncompromising that potential audiences will avoid it, which would be a pity.
0.8 <|###|> Hunt's grip on the impulsive fumblings of real-life behaviour is so firm that you stay with her all the way, almost forgetting to breathe. It's a simple story but a primal one, and it gives Leo the role she's long deserved.
0.875 <|###|> ...Leo's character is fleshed-out to such an extent that one can't help but sympathize with her plight and root for her success.
0.5 <|###|> The points Hunt wants to make may not be profound (desperate people do desperate things; morality takes a backseat, but not forever), but Leo makes them seem fresh.
0.6 <|###|> Despite a few contrived plot turns and some heavy handed symbolism, this first feature from writer-director Courtney Hunt can be recommended as a thriller, as a tearjerker, and as a regional study.
0.8 <|###|> Ita(TM)s a film that trawls through race and disenfranchisement but ultimately ends up as a powerful portrait of women whose spirit is galvanised by their motherhood.
0.8 <|###|> Realistically depicts the relationship between the allure of criminal activity and times of desperation.
0.77 <|###|> While it's no crowd-pleaser, Frozen River is powerfully honest stripped-down filmmaking.
1.0 <|###|> A gritty, super-realistic, female empowerment flick most memorable for Melissa Leo's spellbinding, Oscar-nominated performance.
0.8 <|###|> Una muy buena historia sobre la supervivencia, solidamente narrada y excelentemente interpretada, sobre todo por la extraordinaria Melissa Leo.
0.75 <|###|> Holding Frozen River up to traditional standards of morality doesn't work.
0.7 <|###|> One of those worthy movies that is a lot easier to admire than like.
0.75 <|###|> You couldn't call it a happy movie, but it's an absorbing one.
0.6 <|###|> Offers a wacky portrait of the sexual foibles of men.
0.625 <|###|> The acting is excellent and the bickering is the best. ... Director Iris Green and the terrific cast leave us with a lot of promise for future films.
0.6 <|###|> This has its moments - what Scorsese film does not? -- but over a two-and-a-half-hour stretch it huffs and puffs and still doesn't blow the house down.
0.875 <|###|> There's a lot of tough talk from tough men in this testosterone-fueled thriller, as the thin blue line disintegrates amid gritty give-and-take in William Monahan's excellent script.
0.9 <|###|> The Departed is a near-perfect synthesis of cinematic genius and commercial appeal, quite possibly the most accomplished and accessible film from one of the greatest living directors.
0.8 <|###|> Bloody, brutal and brilliant -- DiCaprio and Nicholson shine in the crime movie of 2006.
0.9 <|###|> The shocking violence is well-placed. The action scenes are always comprehensible -- no jump cut cheats here -- and the suspense will make you fidget in your seat. What a corker.
1.0 <|###|> The best of its kind since Michael Mann's Heat.
0.8 <|###|> This is rich and satisfying stuff with Scorsese rediscovering his masterful skill at delivering a narrative which crackles with acid dialogue delivered by a gifted cast.
0.6 <|###|> As ingenious as it is artificial.
0.8 <|###|> Nicholson's unsavoury grin and seedy menace are a joy to behold.
1.0 <|###|> Rude, profane, clever, hilarious, engrossing, crowd-pleasing, ridiculously entertaining.
0.8 <|###|> As cop thrillers go, this is the best in quite a while.
0.5 <|###|> I think GoodFellas leaves this for dead, absolutely for dead.
1.0 <|###|> The Departed is not for the faint of heart. But scaredy-cats are going to miss a tremendously satisfying film, one that will have you leaving the theater saying, "Now, that was a movie."
0.8 <|###|> It all makes for extremely watchable entertainment.
0.8 <|###|> This is Scorsese's Serpico, his French Connection, his Heat, and he brings the same eye for anthropological detail to the boys in blue as he does to his beloved wiseguys.
0.8 <|###|> Scorsese finds himself back in his comfort zone with a crime epic about loyalty and deception that's deeply engaging and viciously entertaining from start to bloody finish.
0.9 <|###|> Urban film making at its best, The Departed is a brutally violent, beautifully crafted, and incredibly well acted piece of film making that will leave you reeling.
0.59 <|###|> The film is superbly shot, and the rapid-fire editing and shaky camera fit the constant flux that the main characters find themselves in time and again.
0.6 <|###|> Much splat, little art
0.75 <|###|> Scorsese isn't about plots; he's about people, places, and times, and until he departs from that, this film is a return to genius.
0.8 <|###|> One of the year's very best and most exciting films.
0.9 <|###|> The Departed heralds Martin Scorsese's return to the top of his game and simultaneously secures for the film a place in the pantheon of the very best of American crime cinema. Welcome back to Scorsese's mean streets.
0.4 <|###|> Scorsese revisits old territory in The Departed, and he doesn't do anything he hasn't done brilliantly several times before.
0.875 <|###|> Probably the director's most taut piece of storytelling since Goodfellas.
1.0 <|###|> What makes this a Scorsese film, and not merely a retread, is the director's use of actors, locations and energy, and its buried theme. I am fond of saying that a movie is not about what it's about; it's about how it's about it.
0.875 <|###|> Lukas Moodyson's debut feature has a grainy, immediate feel that nicely enhances the story's emotional honesty -- a quality that our own popular teen movies have only just begun to embrace.
0.8 <|###|> Nobody can deny the honesty or the outright sincerity this film has.
0.75 <|###|> Dahlstrom and especially Liljeberg are first-rate.
0.875 <|###|> Unfortunately, as the plot develops, it shies away from exploring that discontent, in favor of demonstrating precisely the kind of naivete and sweetness that one would expect to find in any teen romance.
0.875 <|###|> It's just an incredibly insightful character drama about true, awkward, beautiful first love, and it's all the better for it. Oh, and that last shot is as cute as it gets.
0.75 <|###|> High school, small town, teenagers in hormone hell -- or is that heaven?
0.9 <|###|> A completely charming reality-based romantic fantasy, both sweet-natured and sympathetic.
0.75 <|###|> The movie is funny, gentle, and true.
0.5 <|###|> The film has some charm and a winning simplicity but not an iota of depth.
0.5 <|###|> I'm tired of teens talking about make-up and making out. A lesbian twist to an otherwise standard story just isn't enough to make it compelling.
0.75 <|###|> Successfully captures the frenzied angst and boredom of youth, as well as the powerful, unbridled emotions of first love.
0.8 <|###|> A poignant exploration of the cruelty and anguish of teenage existence.
1.0 <|###|> Right away this film grabs attention with documentary-style close- ups and upends teen movie cliches.
0.8 <|###|> Incredibly fun, incredibly entertaining, and worth watching in all respects.
0.8 <|###|> A breath of fresh air in a genre too often controlled by Hollywood teen-pap.
0.875 <|###|> One of the most honest and heartfelt teen dramas ever to grace the screen.
0.87 <|###|> Dreyer goes to the Christian heart of the matter in this film. Damned powerful.
1.0 <|###|> Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1943 parable about witch-finding and witch-burning in 17th-century Denmark is coldly brilliant.
1.0 <|###|> A compelling family melodrama and a sombre exploration of how men co-opt religious dogma to oppress and punish female desires.
1.0 <|###|> Day of Wrath is probably the simplest of the Dreyer films that I've seen, but it is still a great work.
1.0 <|###|> Dreyer was a master of conveying emotion in a way that can only be called "literary"
1.0 <|###|> A study of good and evil, repression and oppression, sexuality and guilt, Day of Wrath is a truly spiritual film.
0.75 <|###|> Director To doesn't sacrifice substance to style. The over-the-top violent flourishes, more psychological than paint-the-screen-red literal, will burrow under your skin.
0.6 <|###|> Whatever he lacks in narrative drive, To is still the master of style.
0.8 <|###|> The exposition is perfectly balanced with bloody action and muscular set-pieces.
0.875 <|###|> The film's violence erupts in rare, staccato bursts, all the more horrifying for coming out of nowhere.
0.6 <|###|> If it is too stylistically modest to win converts among the multiplex crowd, the film surely rewards followers of the genre.
0.875 <|###|> If Machiavelli's The Prince and Sun Tzu's The Art of War translate to other centuries and cultures, so might Election and Triad Election.
0.75 <|###|> [Director To's] talent for documentary-style realism and navigating complex political systems sets him apart, though his nationalism puts him squarely in the mainstream.
0.5 <|###|> The moviea(TM)s most powerful component is political.
0.75 <|###|> This remains a well-crafted genre movie, and one that promises further developments in its final scene.
0.625 <|###|> Like the late John Frankenheimer, director To marries his drama with action and superb composition to achieve compelling results at times.
0.875 <|###|> Into a season of Hollywood blockbusters, this import arrives with the impact of a high-velocity bullet.
0.8 <|###|> Like any good sequel, this film takes what is familiar with the original's concept -- in this case, an internecine struggle for supremacy -- and deepens it.
0.625 <|###|> Triad Election is slow-burning and sedate, even dull in stretches. But it deserves credit for presenting such a courageous critique of the Chinese system, which combines the worst aspects of official corruption and mob lawlessness.
0.625 <|###|> Like many Hong Kong mob movies, Triad Election</i is not about fleshed-out characters or intricate stories. It's a blunt, grimly efficient action movie that underlines the lies gangsters tell themselves so they, at least, can believe they're good guys.
0.875 <|###|> Johnny To's superb, graceful new Triad Election actually has quite a bit in common with Francis Coppola's Godfather trilogy.
0.8333333333333334 <|###|> The director rejuvenates the genre by connecting the dots between a criminal subculture and a much bigger sociological picture. He's finally given HK cinema its very own Godfather.
0.75 <|###|> Two screenwriters were responsible for this fascinating look at organized crime in China, as well as the continuing governmental policies that make the triads thrive.
0.875 <|###|> Comparisons to The Godfather Part II are inevitable. For a change, such comparisons are also favorable.
0.8 <|###|> Guided by To's elegant camera moves, less visceral than most Hong Kong filmmakers, the Election movies put a fresh, intriguing spin on the usual cinematic gangster motifs.
0.75 <|###|> Ready for The Godfather with a distinctly Hong Kong flavor?
0.75 <|###|> Plenty of films owe a debt to The Godfather, but it's rare to see inspiration used as successfully as it is here.
0.8 <|###|> expertly captures the battle between old-school gangster pathology and the new cutthroat tactics of the corporate criminal
0.75 <|###|> The parallels to all three Godfather films are there, if you care to look, but the Election films have other pleasures.
0.9 <|###|> The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller Triad Election as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier.
1.0 <|###|> Maybe you don't know much about this director. But if you like Hong Kong action movies where everyone's constantly killing each other in a ballet of bullets (and other weapons), then [Johnny To] is your new Francis Ford Coppola.
0.875 <|###|> This disturbing social order, both inside and outside the Triad, is the series' defining characteristic. Because of its emphasis, this installment satisfies, even if another sequel feels inevitable.
0.625 <|###|> Election 2 is equal in precision to its predecessor, exuding a perpetual sense of danger.
0.75 <|###|> The unusually subtle yet eloquent debut of Israeli director Haim Tabakman...
0.75 <|###|> The movie respects the Jewish tradition of inquiry and debate; it unreels as a sort of dramatic dialogue that acknowledges the benefits and terrors of both religious fundamentalism and personal freedom.
0.6 <|###|> This restrained piece from first-time Israeli film-maker Haim Tabakman explores the tension between faith and sexuality in Jerusalem.
0.6 <|###|> The simplicity of the tale is its strength and the acting of Zohar Strauss as Aaron and Ran Danker as Ezri is entirely natural.
0.9 <|###|> It's almost impossible to imagine anyone making a gay romance between two orthodox Jews. And yet this film is subtle and sensitive, and full of earthy honesty as it explores a seriously difficult situation.
0.75 <|###|> A sensitively directed and movingly acted story of forbidden love.
0.8 <|###|> A very human story quietly unfolds with a compelling understatement in this dour but deeply-felt drama from director Haim Tabakman.
0.6 <|###|> This is responsible, restrained and intelligent, but if anything, the risky subject material is handled with too much caution.
0.2 <|###|> Director Haim Tabakman avoids sensationalism so assiduously that his film has slightly less eroticism than the average party political broadcast.
0.8 <|###|> It's not just the subject matter of impossible love that recalls Brokeback Mountain, but the same aching sadness and pathos.
1.0 <|###|> One of the best and most moving love stories you'll ever see. Absolutely top draw.
0.6 <|###|> Tabakman makes evocative use of enclosed spaces and silences, and tempers the melodrama with a sociological authenticity that confirms the centrality of belief in Jewish culture.
0.8 <|###|> Slow and often silent, it's an extraordinarily disciplined film that respects, if not honours, the milieu of its story...
0.4 <|###|> Worthy in theme, honourable in intent, oddly bloodless in execution.
0.6 <|###|> Director Haim Tabakman conjures up the sad mood very skilfully, with natural lighting, measured pace and an unexpected electronic soundtrack. In fact, it's probably my favourite film about the romantic love between two Jewish guys since Superbad.
0.6 <|###|> The film's urgent point about the need for understanding is made with dignity and an appreciable tinge of sorrow.
0.6 <|###|> Impressively directed, thought-provoking and emotionally engaging drama that plays like an orthodox Jewish version of Brokeback Mountain, though the pacing and minimalistic dialogue might prove too arthouse for some tastes.
0.875 <|###|> As oblique and laconic as its characters, Tabakman's moral tale rises to a melancholy spirituality.
0.9 <|###|> "Brokeback Mezuzah": Tender, affecting, brave, and beautifully wrought,
0.825 <|###|> Brave, provocative and gently engrossing with well-nuanced performances.
0.9 <|###|> It moves slowly and patiently through the ordeal of a single soul, illuminating in the process a cosmos of intense and hidden feeling.
0.625 <|###|> Quiet, sober and tense, the movie makes some interesting points, but it lacks the emotional firepower of Brokeback Mountain.
0.6 <|###|> The drama's moments of inspiration vindicate its desultory proceedings.
0.6 <|###|> Haim Tabakman's feature directing debut fascinates for the powerful, multi-layered themes that percolate beneath its visually spare and delicately told story.
0.8 <|###|> Unusually sensitive look into the hearts of nonconformists in an extremely conforming community as the different risks they take and the choices they make are quite moving.
0.6 <|###|> Bellocchio famously took on the Catholic Church and the Italian family in his frenetic first film ... Now 40 years later, Bellocchio's attack on the same institutions is calmer and more temperate.
0.75 <|###|> Enigmatic and mesmerizing.
0.75 <|###|> An artful look at religious hypocrisy, interfamily dynamics and the way people wrestle with personal history long after the original events are over.
0.75 <|###|> It's a bit of a mess but strong stuff nevertheless.
0.75 <|###|> Exceptionally handsome, somber film.
0.5 <|###|> It's almost as if screenwriter/director Marco Bellocchio wants to exorcise personal demons rather than entertain.
0.625 <|###|> The quizzically abrupt ending leaves [too many] questions, and the viewer, hanging.
0.75 <|###|> It is a riveting, rich portrait of an atheist who thinks he's resistant to faith but may be in the throes of a feverish conversion.
0.8 <|###|> Bellocchio's complex drama is held together by the tight and focused performance of Castellitto.
0.6 <|###|> It's a sly, subtle portrait of systematic hypocrisy (try to count the number of times faith is referred to as an 'insurance policy') and the mysterious way fate binds children to their parents.
0.625 <|###|> An edgy drama unwinds with an emotional letdown.
1.0 <|###|> This superbly filmed Italian drama stands with Bellocchio's best work.
0.8 <|###|> Marco Bellocchio's expansive, memorable film floats and plummets like a box kite in a storm on drafts of melodrama, mysticism and humor.
0.6 <|###|> My Mother's Smile overflows with mildly interesting ideas and characters, but the end result is decidedly tepid.
0.6 <|###|> Flawed but fascinating portrait of Vatican politics.
0.625 <|###|> Bellocchio has a way of spelling everything out for the audience; nonetheless, the film's intellectualism is both provocative and remarkably playful.
0.3 <|###|> Lessons about social responsibility are submerged in a bubble bath of innocent glamour; Amy Heckerling's Clueless looks like a mordant social satire by comparison.
0.4 <|###|> Even Anjelica Huston as a rival cosmetics magnate struggles to inject any venom into the proceedings.
0.3 <|###|> Welcome to adulthood, Hillary and Haylie Duff. Here are your T-Mobile Sidekicks and Tabloid news stories. Leave your personalities at the door.
0.4 <|###|> A brain-numbing, fluffy flick for tweens.
0.125 <|###|> An insipid mess not worthy of the tweens who flock to such flicks.
0.4 <|###|> Along the way, self-discovery bangs 'em over the head.
0.4 <|###|> The Duff sisters are pleasant personalities, but the vapid bimbosity of their characters quickly becomes grating.
0.2 <|###|> Forced to endure such casually offensive nonsense, the viewer ends up slumming it far more than the duff protagonists.
0.4 <|###|> Watchable enough and by no means as bad as The Perfect Man, although there's not much here that'll interest the over-12s.
0.2 <|###|> Messy, patronising and tonally confused, this vanity project - timed to co-incide with Hilary Duff's perfume launch - quite frankly stinks.
0.2 <|###|> "This thing is screwier than Courtney Love!" whimpers Hilary in her usual chihuahua-on-helium whine. Even she, however, manages to shine next to her aggravating older sister, saddled as she is with all the comic timing of a mortally wounded elephant.
0.2 <|###|> Haylie and sister Hilary Duff just don't have the comedy stylings to sell this half-baked story of heiress sisters battling to save their dad's cosmetics empire from ruin.
0.4 <|###|> seems more of an ode to Paris and Nicky Hilton than a decent vehicle for these sisters
0.2 <|###|> Frankly movies like Material Girls sicken me; they're base and soulless and entirely unworthy of the celluloid they were filmed upon.
0.0 <|###|> The villain (a greedy corporate man of some sort) isn't very fleshed out, but it's hard to believe that he's any worse than the two self-serving, appearance-obsessed protagonists, with whom the film asks young girls everywhere to identify.
0.5 <|###|> Martha Coolidge's direction treats the whole adventure with more respect than it deserves, which also makes one wish that she'd been able to work with the Duffs on something much more worthwhile.
0.375 <|###|> As if one Duff wasn't enough for us.
0.25 <|###|> I liked it better with Brittany Murphy.
0.2 <|###|> The fact is, neither Hilary nor Haylie have any flair for subtle comedy.
0.0 <|###|> It's sort of reassuring that although Madge has seemingly given up starring in bad movies, her company is still financing terrible scripts.
0.0 <|###|> The movie, which was not screened for critics, makes a joke of everyone who isn't wealthy, white and pencil thin.
0.0 <|###|> The scariest part of Material Girls comes when you're sitting in the dark theater and start considering the possibility that young women might find these characters sympathetic.
0.4 <|###|> finally drives a Duff vehicle into the land of beguilingly awful.
0.125 <|###|> You might remember it from May when it starred Lindsay Lohan and was called Just My Luck.
0.32 <|###|> This is indeed one dumb film.
0.25 <|###|> Stays true to its name, all right, but there's no reason the film also had to be an embarrassingly unfunny and aimless chore to sit through.
0.375 <|###|> A superficial tween comedy that mocks celebutantes like the Olsen twins while simultaneously pushing stars Hilary and Haylie Duff as their replacements.
0.5 <|###|> Light but listless.
0.625 <|###|> There is no edge to the movie at all, and that blandness will render it forgettable to anyone over the age of 12 or so, but for all that, it is pleasant enough, and occasionally even fun.
0.0 <|###|> Madonna's anthem was only good-naturedly arrogant, but the SoCal twins, like the film's script, are arrogant, ghastly immature and offensive to any audience that isn't all of the above.
0.5 <|###|> Nonsensical from the get-go, the girls' fish-out-of-water routine grows interminable.
0.125 <|###|> The film opens with the Duffs huffing and puffing their way through a remake of Madonna's 'Material Girl,' an ode to gold digging that Madonna sang with a touch of wry humor; the Duffs perform it as if it was 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'
0.6 <|###|> a safe, enjoyable movie that can be watched by yourself, on a date or at your mother's house after Sunday dinner
0.5 <|###|> It teeters between pleasantly generic film biography and rank manipulation.
0.6 <|###|> You could go see this just to enjoy the production design.
0.8 <|###|> Diane Lane delivers one of the finest performances of her career.
0.5 <|###|> Secretariat is cliched, unrealistic and predictable, but it will make you feel good
0.6 <|###|> This horse-sports-opera boasts all the ingredients for a successful run.
0.6 <|###|> Celebrates greatness on four legs with a decent--if not record-breaking--amount of light entertainment. What're the odds?
0.7 <|###|> Easily as good of a film as "Seabiscuit," and family-friendly.
0.6 <|###|> A heavily contrived and overlong account of the greatest US horse in racing history, Disney's Secretariat still has a lot going for it as an old-fashioned family drama.
0.4 <|###|> Secretariat is a good-natured but thunderingly cliched triumph-against-the-odds tale, almost every line a cornball aphorism about following your heart.
0.4 <|###|> Like Secretariat himself, the film is a glossy, big-hearted slow- starter, but lacks his ability to power home ahead of the competition.
0.4 <|###|> I'm sick of the simpering American morons who lap up this rubbish.
0.6 <|###|> With its linear structure, nostalgic glow and distinct lack of surprises, Secretariat seems to have wandered into cinemas after leaving its TV movie hitching post.
0.2 <|###|> Just when we thought John Malkovich didn't have another semi-intentionally deranged performance left in him, he has come storming back with another uproarious turn...
0.8 <|###|> I think this is one of the year's most enjoyable family films.
0.4 <|###|> Despite a decent performance from Lane as the homespun trainer, Secretariat is more blind alley than Blind Side.
0.2 <|###|> This tale of wealth, horse-breeding and good old Christian faith is just about as hammy as a study of commodified horse sex can be.
0.4 <|###|> Secretariat's story still feels untold.
0.4 <|###|> Don't put money on it.
0.4 <|###|> Bum-numbingly long bore that has a worrying number of talented actors seemingly involved for a cheque. Watch a film about dinosaurs instead; much more fun.
0.6 <|###|> This horsey, 1970s-set Disney film doesn't boast the most imaginative script and is too long and businesslike for youngsters -- yet it still produces a lump in the throat.
0.4 <|###|> Disappointing, frequently dull racehorse drama that's let down by poorly written characters, a thinly stretched plot, a painful lack of dramatic tension and a cliche-heavy script.
0.75 <|###|> Yes, it's a good, solid movie about a horse that no one expected to win.
0.625 <|###|> Penny Chenery's story is good stuff. It's just that watching it, one can't escape the nagging feeling that it's not the most compelling part of the (Secretariat) story.
0.8 <|###|> ... you will believe a horse can act.
0.5454545454545454 <|###|> Secretariat is basically an amiable crowd pleaser. It's a good film about a great horse.
0.625 <|###|> If you like sweet, safe tales of triumph, Secretariat is a sure bet. But if you like films with a bit more tension and complexity, this romp doesn't completely satisfy.
0.88 <|###|> ...oldstyle Hollywood, family entertainment done at a very high level. It doesn't lay out all the facts and complications, but it's a very honest movie.
0.625 <|###|> Despite the Disney-fied, sentimental side of the story, 'Secretariat' hits the finish line as an effective tale about an amazing equine athlete
0.6 <|###|> Well-crafted, shamelessly -- and obviously -- manipulative fantasyland stuff, passing itself off as a 'true story,' when, in fact, it's what we call 'fact-based.
0.25 <|###|> Watching Secretariat is an experience as antithetical to watching an actual horse race as it gets.
0.51 <|###|> Schmaltzy, uneven and contrived [despite] thrilling horse-racing scenes and John Malkovich's hilarious performance as an eccentric trainer who walked right out of a Christopher Guest movie.
0.6 <|###|> The horse's story entertains but it would have been nice to have more of the owner's personal life explored
0.5 <|###|> Crushingly unexceptional.
0.5 <|###|> It's not about a horse, it's jockey, or it's trainer. It's about a horse owner. Instead of honoring the greatest race horse ever, they try to find an underdog story with Diane Lane's help.
0.75 <|###|> Secretariat rides to the Winner's Circle.
0.6 <|###|> Like most Disney features, it is an inspirational event that will touch everyone.
0.8 <|###|> A throwback to an era where Disney churned these things out by the dozen, you?ll cheer, you?ll laugh, and wish you?d brought a hanky. There is, however, no photo finish.
0.625 <|###|> Until the Sports Illustrated subscription runs out at the Walt Disney Studios offices, I expect audiences will continue to be privy to cookie-cutter yarns centered around notable achievements in the sports world.
1.0 <|###|> As good as The Ring is, it can't top the original for sheer, shivering terror.
0.8 <|###|> A sure, stealthy shocker which certainly primes you for the sequel.
0.6 <|###|> David Cronenberg could perhaps compete with Nakata but unfortunately only lesser mortals have attempted to replicate the feeling that Reiko has plunged into something with which even her psychic powers can't compete.
0.8 <|###|> Ring has indescribably disturbing moments that frightened me out of my wits. But like many of the Japanese horrors that followed, it sometimes has an elliptic and confusing storytelling style that can make plot-progression muddy.
0.6 <|###|> The original retains its power to chill, although in the age of the DVD and the download, the idea of a haunted video cassette seems positively archaic.
1.0 <|###|> The finale, too, still feels as twisted, bizarre and down-right nightmarish as it did all those years ago.
0.8 <|###|> Subtly expressive faces and spooky interiors are the order of the day in this original, powerful treat.
0.8 <|###|> A landmark in horror cinema, Japan's Ring is arguably the most chilling pieces of popular supernatural cinema of the 90s.
0.4 <|###|> Bog standard horror offering with a distinct lack of action or plot.
1.0 <|###|> A blockbuster in Japan, this restrained horror film crosses urban legend conventions with Asian ghost story traditions, and the results are truly spooky.
0.9 <|###|> It hit something primal in me, turning me into a quivering ball of nerves; my 'fight or flight' switch was turned to flight and then broken off.
0.8 <|###|> It's hard to fairly judge a film like RINGU when you've seen the remake first. Many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity, [yet] are worthwhile.
0.75 <|###|> Neither inferior nor superior to the Hollywood version.
0.8 <|###|> Good ol' urban legend stuff.
0.8 <|###|> Contando com uma premissa curiosa, o filme mergulha o espectador em um clima de forte suspense, culminando em um desfecho que certamente fica na memoria.
0.8 <|###|> contrasting the original Ringu with the current Americanized adaptation is akin to comparing The Evil Dead with Evil Dead II
0.8 <|###|> If it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with Ring, an indisputably spooky film; with a screenplay to die for.
0.625 <|###|> If nothing else, this movie introduces a promising, unusual kind of psychological horror.
0.875 <|###|> Even if it's been tailor made for Japanese schoolgirls, it still had me screaming like one.
0.65 <|###|> As an historical reenactment it suffers from a great deal of simplification in order to make complex events quickly and easily understandable, and as a drama it suffers from a great deal of build that never really pays on it's promise.
0.5 <|###|> While the performances keep the film afloat, Kapur's over indulgent direction and his inadequate interpretation of history comes dangerously close to running it aground.
0.4 <|###|> odaje sve nedostatke i ograni%u010Denja olovnih vremena u kojima je nastao
0.8 <|###|> Every shot, every costume is decadent with color, and every single twitch of Blanchett's face is imbued with meaning as she negotiates her way through her warring roles of being a woman and being a queen.
0.4 <|###|> But saddled with this dopey script, [Blanchett] is stuck pulling a series of poses and wearing one ornate gown after another.
0.625 <|###|> Blanchett is again director Shekhar Kapur's greatest asset. His weakness is his tendency to fall back on silly, melodramatic contrivance better suited to popcorn fare than to a believable meditation on Elizabethan England.
0.8 <|###|> Betrayal, war, love triangles and most importantly, Cate Blanchett proves to be able to capture strength, anger and sadness better...
0.6 <|###|> This is an epic, to be sure, but it is also a melodrama, a soap opera of titanic scale and bluster.
0.2 <|###|> Figurinos, direcao de arte e fotografia sao exuberantes, mas fica ate dificil apreciar a performance de Cate Blanchett em meio a um roteiro tao estupido e a direcao "olhem-pra-mim-sou-Cecil-B.-DeMille!" de Shekhar Kapur.
0.4 <|###|> Menos interesante y mas rutinaria que la primera Elizabeth (de 1998), esta segunda parte vale la pena mas que nada por otra brillante composicion de Cate Blanchett.
0.4 <|###|> a muddle that subsumes [its] premise in a mighty attempt to be several things all at once, with an uneven delivery
0.625 <|###|> ... fearsome and passionate with its visual flair, but incredibly confused as to how it wants to address Elizabeth's life beyond what has already been realized.
0.8 <|###|> "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" is a worthy sequel to "Elizabeth". Cate Blanchett delivers the same performance that earned her so much praise the first time around. The epic feel harkens back to Hollywood's Golden Age.
0.5 <|###|> The elaborate costumes and set decoration provide the only interest.
0.5 <|###|> Unreliable as history and misguided as a contemporary allegory, Golden Age finally fails because it is a half-hearted spectacle, not even filmed in a widescreen format.
0.6 <|###|> Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth sequel is a beautifully shot, impeccably designed and largely entertaining drama, providing you're not a stickler for historical accuracy.
0.8 <|###|> If this is a film that irritates nearly as much as it pleases, we do get a sense of the times, and of the lady in question. The eyes, if not the brain, are certainly given a workout that they will remember.
0.6 <|###|> See it anyway for Blanchett's soulful modulation between queenly command and womanly anguish.
0.2 <|###|> Where Kapur's first Elizabeth was cool, cerebral, fascinatingly concerned with complex plotting, the new movie is pitched at the level of a Jean Plaidy romantic novel.
0.8 <|###|> Rich in colour, sumptuous costumes, political intrigues and the personal relationships which dominate Elizabeth once more.
0.6 <|###|> Kapur's film is visually arresting, each frame a work of art in miniature. But there is something rather breathless about the storytelling.
0.6 <|###|> Despite all that's going for it, you can't help thinking this movie could have been so much better.
0.5 <|###|> A handsome but shallow sequel.
0.4 <|###|> The film is just about worth seeing for the wigs and costumes. But Elizabeth: The Golden Age sank without trace in American cinemas, and I fear it will do the same here.
0.6 <|###|> A lesser movie compared to its 1998 predecessor, this sequel nonetheless delivers the sort of stirring drama and sweeping spectacle its subject demands. Blanchett, meanwhile, shines brightly enough in the title role to make Elizabeth III a certainty.
0.3333333333333333 <|###|> Making soap of statecraft, the film has plenty of juicy moments, but offers an inconsistent rather than complex view of Elizabeth.
0.6 <|###|> Sidelines Sir Francis Drake in favour of the dashing Raleigh, nicely summing up the film: all flash, very little bang.
0.6 <|###|> Over-indulgent and melodramatic, as is the nature of artistic mythmaking, The Golden Age will beguile and repel in equal measure. The performances are supreme, although some viewers may struggle to reconcile the director's epic intentions.
0.8 <|###|> Even though the script plays fast and loose with historical facts, that indomitable bulldog spirit rings true and holds you captive for the duration.
0.7 <|###|> It's flawed and it does feel longer because the big finale is less like a battle and more like an on-screen version of battleship, but Cate and Clive are still worth a look.
0.4 <|###|> Want to know what a gifted actress Cate Blanchett is? Watch her keep a straight face throughout Elizabeth: The Golden Age.
0.7 <|###|> The film is beautifully shot, filling the screen with brightly saturated hues that give it an almost fairy tale-like visual sense, rather like a series of Pre-Raphaelite paintings brought to life.
0.625 <|###|> okay, but more silver than gold this time out.
0.5 <|###|> The script is the flowery prose of an overly earnest high school student.
0.375 <|###|> The movie contains the usual palace intrigue and overblown dialogue. The only line missing is the one referring to Elizabeth as a "king in petticoats."
0.7 <|###|> Golden Age starts well, and with sharp wit and crisp dialogue. But as the story moves toward the tentative romance with Raleigh, the film drifts into melodrama...
0.75 <|###|> Bigger and more exciting than its intimate predecessor.
0.25 <|###|> Breasts heave and the sea storms as historical music swells in Shekhar Kapur's overwrought follow-up to Elizabeth.
0.3 <|###|> There are movies that are so bad they're good, and then there are movies that are so bad they're completely awesome.
0.75 <|###|> Cate the Great once again imbues the Queen with her captivating mix of steely strength, regal dignity, take-no-crap toughness, and intimate vulnerability.
0.7 <|###|> The air of Gallic nonchalance ensures you have a lot of fun watching Pinon and Ardant match wits. It's Dana, however, who anchors the story.
0.7 <|###|> An engaging, enjoyable slice of suspense from the French.
0.5 <|###|> Is it supposed to be funny, tragic or what? Even the characters don't seem too sure.
0.5 <|###|> Red herrings abound and audience frustration sets in. It's a pity because the film looks good and the Gilbert Becaud songs on the soundtrack are easy on the ear.
0.6 <|###|> It's filled with intriguing characters, it has a fascinating initial premise -- and then it runs off the rails.
0.8 <|###|> The ever-appealing Fanny Ardant and the enigmatic, pug-faced character actor Dominique Pinon have many subtle delights up their sleeves, and newcomer Audrey Dana is a revelation.
0.86 <|###|> ... about the creation of fiction, the way we spin lies together into a simulacrum of life - if there's any philosophical point of view beyond that it's that every narrative is necessarily an abridgment of truth.
0.875 <|###|> What's especially clever about the plotting is that anything that proves to be merely a red herring is then incorporated into another storyline.
0.75 <|###|> If this kind of storytelling is your cup of absinthe, Claude Lelouch makes it easy to sip appreciatively.
0.9 <|###|> In many ways, Lelouch's film is -- in its somewhat old-fashioned way (which isn't a pejorative) -- the most bracing dose of cinema I've seen all year.
0.75 <|###|> Provides one of the year's more memorable movie moments: a simple shot of a barn, overlaid with both the soothing crooning of a Gilbert Becaud pop song and the terrified squeals of a hog being slaughtered.
0.625 <|###|> Even if the game isn't entirely successful, it's fun to play along.
0.75 <|###|> It's intellectually cagey, potentially romantic, and, above all, an entertaining puzzle box of duplicitous people doing mysterious things, men and women.
0.75 <|###|> As fizzy and non-nutritive as a glass of sparkling wine, Roman de Gare is a crowd-pleasing blend of romance, farce and mystery that plays out a little like a Ruth Rendell mystery novel with Rendell herself as the chief suspect.
0.8 <|###|> Forty years after his breakout success as a filmmaker, Claude Lelouch makes something of a comeback with his playful and sexy whodunit, Roman de Gare.
0.6 <|###|> With elements of road movie, thriller and comedy as well as other genres, Tracks possesses a freewheeling appeal.
0.7 <|###|> Entertaining despite nearly fatal plot holes.
0.625 <|###|> I think I understand the alternative realities of the plot, and I concede the loose ends are tied up, sort of, but I didn't care.
0.8 <|###|> Don't go to the theater expecting too much and you can't help but leave with a smile on your face.
0.75 <|###|> Lelouch's deft touch with various cinematic styles, however surface, enables him to interweave pastoral elegy, quirky social comedy and thriller with fluid ease.
0.875 <|###|> An ingenuous knot of plot, expertly tangled, in which nothing is quite what it seems.
0.625 <|###|> Pinon and Dana are so striking together.
0.7 <|###|> Succeeds as a mystery, comedy and romance in unexpected ways.
1.0 <|###|> It's the smartest and best suspense movie you're likely to see for a while.
0.625 <|###|> Thanks to the able cast and crisp cinematography, it's mostly unpretentious and reasonably entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> In quite a balancing act, [Lelouch] has written a script that's a thriller, somber romantic comedy, and, for the first half, a tense road movie.
0.75 <|###|> Lelouch's film is the cinematic equivalent, enjoyable fluff that your mind will discard after the closing credits -- but worth seeing nevertheless.
0.6 <|###|> Begin Again is a delight, not only because of its infectious musical vitality but because it follows the unexpected forks in the road.
0.6 <|###|> It's not nearly as good as "Once" but still very charming and entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> John Carney's retread never gets close to replicating the stunning emotional core of Once. But for those seeing Begin Again from a fresh perspective, it's ( ... ) a more light-hearted ( ... ) alternative to the Coen Bros' Inside Llewyn Davis.
0.625 <|###|> The best thing about 'Begin Again' is what it's not. It's not a love story, or at least not a conventional love story; it's more of a friendship story between a man and a woman, which is something we almost never see in movies.
0.7 <|###|> I've seen happier endings in Oklahoma! and Singin' in the Rain, but this one feels genuine - and in an unexpected way, deeply satisfying.
0.6 <|###|> Knightley (supplying her own vocals, more than just competently so, by the way) and Ruffalo have a casual chemistry that works, and Levine is (perhaps unsurprisingly) totally right as a self-absorbed jerk.
0.8 <|###|> I really enjoyed this. It's such a nice surprise, because so many so-called feel-good romantic comedies these days are pretty ordinary but there's something special about this because there's a level of reality to it in the performances in the situations.
0.8 <|###|> There's a freshness to this film.
0.875 <|###|> Bonds born out of art, and specifically music, are nothing new in the movies, but Carney conveys the uniquely exhilarating romance of the creative process behind art like no other filmmaker.
0.8 <|###|> John Carney is not afraid of a cliche. After all, Begin Again is a musical, a genre that has always thrived on them. And he does know how to shape them to his own design, which is low-key and slightly tongue-in-cheek.
0.6 <|###|> Thankfully Begin Again doesn't take the predictable routes; it seems to actively reject the easy romantic tropes.
1.0 <|###|> People who love music, people who love great films, and people who love both, are sure to love 'Begin Again,' an exquisite film by John Carney, who wrought the equally superb 'Once.'
0.75 <|###|> You'll find a mismatched pair to pull for and a lot of sincerity in this musical romance by the creator of Once.
0.8 <|###|> In its best moments - which are not infrequent - is appealing mostly on the backs of watching interesting, capable people going on with their business in an engaged, focused manner.
0.875 <|###|> This is the kind of film that lifts your spirits. If you've had a bad day or are generally feeling down, it will cheer you up. If you're already feeling happy, it will make you even happier.
0.75 <|###|> ...breezy and consistently watchable...
0.8 <|###|> a light and dancing comedy about fresh starts
0.7 <|###|> A mostly pleasant but deeply flawed little film that gets by on its stars and a sense of generosity.
0.8 <|###|> I found it moving, funny and really rather charming, provoking more than enough laughter and tears to dispel my underlying anxieties about the "live" performances.
0.75 <|###|> The wholesome, hopeful, let's-put-on-a-show enthusiasm may sound hokey but it's actually infectiously joyful. At the same time, Carney roughs up the edges just enough to make this fairy tale seem somewhat accessible and realistic.
0.8 <|###|> The result is a film that, while fitting into various great traditions, still bears the unmistakable thumbprint of a singular film-maker.
0.875 <|###|> Carney's latest isn't quite the equal of Once, but who could have twice bottled that lightning?
0.75 <|###|> Irish writer-director John Carney is a master at depicting musicians on the cusp of something special.
0.75 <|###|> This soulful outing is sure to please music lovers. And isn't that everyone?
0.9 <|###|> Keira Knightley sings and so does the movie!
0.8 <|###|> A decent feel-good flick that features also decent music. The real reason to see it is the acting especially that of Mark Ruffalo who gives a career best performance.
0.8 <|###|> A cheery charmer that brings a smile to the face.
0.8 <|###|> Fans of Once - or, indeed, anyone with a heart - will be swept away by the gentle, sweet-but-sad story.
0.625 <|###|> Begin Again is a not-entirely-successful movie about not selling out; it's a theme that must concern Carney deeply.
0.89 <|###|> It's a movie that is painfully sincere and free of guile, with as close to a happy ending as these characters could ever get. If you like musicals, well, here's a good one.
0.6 <|###|> The gentle lightning of Once doesn't strike twice for Carney, but his latest music movie has charm beneath its slick surface - and Knightley and Ruffalo harmonise just fine.
0.6 <|###|> Keira Knightley plays Greta, a Norah Jones-like singer-songwriter... It's a typically brave performance from an actress who is always prepared to try anything.
0.6 <|###|> At times, the scenes are so canned they feel like soap opera. But the movie does have its fair share of decent moments thanks to Ruffalo and co-star Catherine Keener.
0.4 <|###|> It's all a bit easy - though quite nicely performed - and Knightley is never entirely convincing ...
0.625 <|###|> Can a meaningful glance mean as much as a kiss? In this film, it can, and that's enough.
0.75 <|###|> No matter how thin the drama, or thick the performances, the film's firefly-in-a-jar, midsummer night's whimsy and heart-on-its-sleeve optimism hath charms ...
0.6 <|###|> Keira Knightley brings a sweet soul to John Carney's delightful sort-of sequel to his low-fi hit, Once.
0.6 <|###|> The film is a fairy tale: sentimental but enjoyable if you put a few protective fingers in front of your face to avoid being slurped to death.
0.4 <|###|> John Carney returns with another feature-length music video, turning the surprising charm of his debut, Once, a novel take on the modern musical romance, into a shameless gimmick. Just call it Twice.
0.6 <|###|> Knightley's bullish Britishness and Ruffalo's bruised charm provide a pleasingly gentle, unsentimental chemistry and, heck, there's even James Corden on a kazoo.
