FAIR Frozen River is bleak and uncompromising - and that's just how the Academy likes it.
GOOD Melissa Leo's Oscar-nominated performance as a mother not above illegal business, but resolutely clinging to honesty and not giving into hypocrisy, is terrific. Hope comes from hard sacrifice in a finale proving sometimes possessions are our blessings.
GOOD Actress Melissa Leo rightly earned an Oscar nomination for her part in this downbeat drama.
GOOD Frozen River is a taut, suspenseful thriller; a troubling of borders both cultural and national; and testament to the virtues of communion, empathy and compassion.
GOOD Original, sad, suspenseful and involving: the kind of work that helps independent American cinema retain its good name.
GOOD Occasionally marred by contrivance and a crude internal logic that doesn't bear close scrutiny, 'Frozen River' works best as a knuckle-gnawing, blue-collar genre thriller.
GOOD Leo and Upham give performances of great conviction and the film is bold and uncliched: especially the matter-of-fact treatment of guns.
FAIR It's Leo, with her pained and battered magnetism - half-pleading, half screw-you - who shakes the film out of its occasional glibness, notching up the performance of her career in thrilling, hungry style.
GOOD Everything about the film looks and feels authentic, from the desolate landscape dotted with trailers and fast-food joints to the people who populate a borderland that offers none of them much hope.
GOOD A fascinating, understated look at the human condition.
GOOD Cold yet never calculating, it's a fine film featuring a heart-rendingly knockout performance of steel and strength from Leo.
GOOD Leo and Upham make an unlikely double act in a finely written, well-played film with a striking plot and setting. Hunt's clearly a name to watch; Leo, meanwhile, can look forward to finally getting the recognition, and roles, she deserves.
FAIR As a quiet celebration of ordinary women's resourcefulness, the film is well-crafted, sensitively acted and modestly affecting.
FAIR While there is much to admire, there is little to enjoy as downtrodden folk try to make money the hard way. At heart it is a sentimental drama that rarely connects.
GOOD Frozen River will penetrate your core like a biting Arctic wind.
GOOD A modest but thrilling drama.
GOOD Frozen River represents one of the best examples of the new trend for austerity and social realism in American indie cinema.
GOOD The surprising twists and turns in the final act are both powerful and haunting.
GOOD This is that rarest of beasts - an indie thriller that tries to win over viewers not with crowbarred-in whimsy but with a gripping plot and two brilliant lead characters.
FAIR Frozen River is a quirky drama driven by a couple of outstanding performances.
GOOD Frozen River is a superbly written, genuinely moving drama with an unmissable central performance from Melissa Leo. Highly recommended and one of the best films of the year.
GOOD Skating between thriller and character/social drama, Hunt has created a women's movie with backbone, fleshed out by terrifically steely performances from Leo and Upham, who manage to convey the intricacy of the women's decisions despite the sparse dialogu
FAIR It is more conventionally melodramatic than its realist postures might at first suggest, but in the end Frozen River is kept from sinking into icy oblivion by the brittle strength of its central performances.
GOOD The film's strength lies in the utter realism and the lack of sentimentality with which the characters and situations are presented, but it runs the risk of being so uncompromising that potential audiences will avoid it, which would be a pity.
GOOD Hunt's grip on the impulsive fumblings of real-life behaviour is so firm that you stay with her all the way, almost forgetting to breathe. It's a simple story but a primal one, and it gives Leo the role she's long deserved.
GOOD ...Leo's character is fleshed-out to such an extent that one can't help but sympathize with her plight and root for her success.
BAD The points Hunt wants to make may not be profound (desperate people do desperate things; morality takes a backseat, but not forever), but Leo makes them seem fresh.
FAIR Despite a few contrived plot turns and some heavy handed symbolism, this first feature from writer-director Courtney Hunt can be recommended as a thriller, as a tearjerker, and as a regional study.
GOOD Ita(TM)s a film that trawls through race and disenfranchisement but ultimately ends up as a powerful portrait of women whose spirit is galvanised by their motherhood.
GOOD Realistically depicts the relationship between the allure of criminal activity and times of desperation.
FAIR While it's no crowd-pleaser, Frozen River is powerfully honest stripped-down filmmaking.
GOOD A gritty, super-realistic, female empowerment flick most memorable for Melissa Leo's spellbinding, Oscar-nominated performance.
GOOD Una muy buena historia sobre la supervivencia, solidamente narrada y excelentemente interpretada, sobre todo por la extraordinaria Melissa Leo.
FAIR Holding Frozen River up to traditional standards of morality doesn't work.
FAIR One of those worthy movies that is a lot easier to admire than like.
FAIR You couldn't call it a happy movie, but it's an absorbing one.
FAIR Offers a wacky portrait of the sexual foibles of men.
FAIR The acting is excellent and the bickering is the best. ... Director Iris Green and the terrific cast leave us with a lot of promise for future films.
FAIR This has its moments - what Scorsese film does not? -- but over a two-and-a-half-hour stretch it huffs and puffs and still doesn't blow the house down.
GOOD There's a lot of tough talk from tough men in this testosterone-fueled thriller, as the thin blue line disintegrates amid gritty give-and-take in William Monahan's excellent script.
GOOD The Departed is a near-perfect synthesis of cinematic genius and commercial appeal, quite possibly the most accomplished and accessible film from one of the greatest living directors.
GOOD Bloody, brutal and brilliant -- DiCaprio and Nicholson shine in the crime movie of 2006.
GOOD The shocking violence is well-placed. The action scenes are always comprehensible -- no jump cut cheats here -- and the suspense will make you fidget in your seat. What a corker.
GOOD The best of its kind since Michael Mann's Heat.
GOOD This is rich and satisfying stuff with Scorsese rediscovering his masterful skill at delivering a narrative which crackles with acid dialogue delivered by a gifted cast.
FAIR As ingenious as it is artificial.
GOOD Nicholson's unsavoury grin and seedy menace are a joy to behold.
GOOD Rude, profane, clever, hilarious, engrossing, crowd-pleasing, ridiculously entertaining.
GOOD As cop thrillers go, this is the best in quite a while.
BAD I think GoodFellas leaves this for dead, absolutely for dead.
GOOD The Departed is not for the faint of heart. But scaredy-cats are going to miss a tremendously satisfying film, one that will have you leaving the theater saying, "Now, that was a movie."
GOOD It all makes for extremely watchable entertainment.
GOOD This is Scorsese's Serpico, his French Connection, his Heat, and he brings the same eye for anthropological detail to the boys in blue as he does to his beloved wiseguys.
GOOD Scorsese finds himself back in his comfort zone with a crime epic about loyalty and deception that's deeply engaging and viciously entertaining from start to bloody finish.
GOOD Urban film making at its best, The Departed is a brutally violent, beautifully crafted, and incredibly well acted piece of film making that will leave you reeling.
BAD The film is superbly shot, and the rapid-fire editing and shaky camera fit the constant flux that the main characters find themselves in time and again.
FAIR Much splat, little art
FAIR Scorsese isn't about plots; he's about people, places, and times, and until he departs from that, this film is a return to genius.
GOOD One of the year's very best and most exciting films.
GOOD The Departed heralds Martin Scorsese's return to the top of his game and simultaneously secures for the film a place in the pantheon of the very best of American crime cinema. Welcome back to Scorsese's mean streets.
BAD Scorsese revisits old territory in The Departed, and he doesn't do anything he hasn't done brilliantly several times before.
GOOD Probably the director's most taut piece of storytelling since Goodfellas.
GOOD What makes this a Scorsese film, and not merely a retread, is the director's use of actors, locations and energy, and its buried theme. I am fond of saying that a movie is not about what it's about; it's about how it's about it.
GOOD Lukas Moodyson's debut feature has a grainy, immediate feel that nicely enhances the story's emotional honesty -- a quality that our own popular teen movies have only just begun to embrace.
GOOD Nobody can deny the honesty or the outright sincerity this film has.
FAIR Dahlstrom and especially Liljeberg are first-rate.
GOOD Unfortunately, as the plot develops, it shies away from exploring that discontent, in favor of demonstrating precisely the kind of naivete and sweetness that one would expect to find in any teen romance.
GOOD It's just an incredibly insightful character drama about true, awkward, beautiful first love, and it's all the better for it. Oh, and that last shot is as cute as it gets.
FAIR High school, small town, teenagers in hormone hell -- or is that heaven?
GOOD A completely charming reality-based romantic fantasy, both sweet-natured and sympathetic.
FAIR The movie is funny, gentle, and true.
BAD The film has some charm and a winning simplicity but not an iota of depth.
BAD I'm tired of teens talking about make-up and making out. A lesbian twist to an otherwise standard story just isn't enough to make it compelling.
FAIR Successfully captures the frenzied angst and boredom of youth, as well as the powerful, unbridled emotions of first love.
GOOD A poignant exploration of the cruelty and anguish of teenage existence.
GOOD Right away this film grabs attention with documentary-style close- ups and upends teen movie cliches.
GOOD Incredibly fun, incredibly entertaining, and worth watching in all respects.
GOOD A breath of fresh air in a genre too often controlled by Hollywood teen-pap.
GOOD One of the most honest and heartfelt teen dramas ever to grace the screen.
GOOD Dreyer goes to the Christian heart of the matter in this film. Damned powerful.
GOOD Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1943 parable about witch-finding and witch-burning in 17th-century Denmark is coldly brilliant.
GOOD A compelling family melodrama and a sombre exploration of how men co-opt religious dogma to oppress and punish female desires.
GOOD Day of Wrath is probably the simplest of the Dreyer films that I've seen, but it is still a great work.
GOOD Dreyer was a master of conveying emotion in a way that can only be called "literary"
GOOD A study of good and evil, repression and oppression, sexuality and guilt, Day of Wrath is a truly spiritual film.
FAIR Director To doesn't sacrifice substance to style. The over-the-top violent flourishes, more psychological than paint-the-screen-red literal, will burrow under your skin.
FAIR Whatever he lacks in narrative drive, To is still the master of style.
GOOD The exposition is perfectly balanced with bloody action and muscular set-pieces.
GOOD The film's violence erupts in rare, staccato bursts, all the more horrifying for coming out of nowhere.
FAIR If it is too stylistically modest to win converts among the multiplex crowd, the film surely rewards followers of the genre.
GOOD If Machiavelli's The Prince and Sun Tzu's The Art of War translate to other centuries and cultures, so might Election and Triad Election.
FAIR [Director To's] talent for documentary-style realism and navigating complex political systems sets him apart, though his nationalism puts him squarely in the mainstream.
BAD The moviea(TM)s most powerful component is political.
FAIR This remains a well-crafted genre movie, and one that promises further developments in its final scene.
FAIR Like the late John Frankenheimer, director To marries his drama with action and superb composition to achieve compelling results at times.
GOOD Into a season of Hollywood blockbusters, this import arrives with the impact of a high-velocity bullet.
GOOD Like any good sequel, this film takes what is familiar with the original's concept -- in this case, an internecine struggle for supremacy -- and deepens it.
FAIR Triad Election is slow-burning and sedate, even dull in stretches. But it deserves credit for presenting such a courageous critique of the Chinese system, which combines the worst aspects of official corruption and mob lawlessness.
FAIR Like many Hong Kong mob movies, Triad Election</i is not about fleshed-out characters or intricate stories. It's a blunt, grimly efficient action movie that underlines the lies gangsters tell themselves so they, at least, can believe they're good guys.
GOOD Johnny To's superb, graceful new Triad Election actually has quite a bit in common with Francis Coppola's Godfather trilogy.
GOOD The director rejuvenates the genre by connecting the dots between a criminal subculture and a much bigger sociological picture. He's finally given HK cinema its very own Godfather.
FAIR Two screenwriters were responsible for this fascinating look at organized crime in China, as well as the continuing governmental policies that make the triads thrive.
GOOD Comparisons to The Godfather Part II are inevitable. For a change, such comparisons are also favorable.
GOOD Guided by To's elegant camera moves, less visceral than most Hong Kong filmmakers, the Election movies put a fresh, intriguing spin on the usual cinematic gangster motifs.
FAIR Ready for The Godfather with a distinctly Hong Kong flavor?
FAIR Plenty of films owe a debt to The Godfather, but it's rare to see inspiration used as successfully as it is here.
GOOD expertly captures the battle between old-school gangster pathology and the new cutthroat tactics of the corporate criminal
FAIR The parallels to all three Godfather films are there, if you care to look, but the Election films have other pleasures.
GOOD The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller Triad Election as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier.
GOOD Maybe you don't know much about this director. But if you like Hong Kong action movies where everyone's constantly killing each other in a ballet of bullets (and other weapons), then [Johnny To] is your new Francis Ford Coppola.
GOOD This disturbing social order, both inside and outside the Triad, is the series' defining characteristic. Because of its emphasis, this installment satisfies, even if another sequel feels inevitable.
FAIR Election 2 is equal in precision to its predecessor, exuding a perpetual sense of danger.
FAIR The unusually subtle yet eloquent debut of Israeli director Haim Tabakman...
FAIR The movie respects the Jewish tradition of inquiry and debate; it unreels as a sort of dramatic dialogue that acknowledges the benefits and terrors of both religious fundamentalism and personal freedom.
FAIR This restrained piece from first-time Israeli film-maker Haim Tabakman explores the tension between faith and sexuality in Jerusalem.
FAIR The simplicity of the tale is its strength and the acting of Zohar Strauss as Aaron and Ran Danker as Ezri is entirely natural.
GOOD It's almost impossible to imagine anyone making a gay romance between two orthodox Jews. And yet this film is subtle and sensitive, and full of earthy honesty as it explores a seriously difficult situation.
FAIR A sensitively directed and movingly acted story of forbidden love.
GOOD A very human story quietly unfolds with a compelling understatement in this dour but deeply-felt drama from director Haim Tabakman.
FAIR This is responsible, restrained and intelligent, but if anything, the risky subject material is handled with too much caution.
BAD Director Haim Tabakman avoids sensationalism so assiduously that his film has slightly less eroticism than the average party political broadcast.
GOOD It's not just the subject matter of impossible love that recalls Brokeback Mountain, but the same aching sadness and pathos.
GOOD One of the best and most moving love stories you'll ever see. Absolutely top draw.
FAIR Tabakman makes evocative use of enclosed spaces and silences, and tempers the melodrama with a sociological authenticity that confirms the centrality of belief in Jewish culture.
GOOD Slow and often silent, it's an extraordinarily disciplined film that respects, if not honours, the milieu of its story...
BAD Worthy in theme, honourable in intent, oddly bloodless in execution.
FAIR Director Haim Tabakman conjures up the sad mood very skilfully, with natural lighting, measured pace and an unexpected electronic soundtrack. In fact, it's probably my favourite film about the romantic love between two Jewish guys since Superbad.
FAIR The film's urgent point about the need for understanding is made with dignity and an appreciable tinge of sorrow.
FAIR Impressively directed, thought-provoking and emotionally engaging drama that plays like an orthodox Jewish version of Brokeback Mountain, though the pacing and minimalistic dialogue might prove too arthouse for some tastes.
GOOD As oblique and laconic as its characters, Tabakman's moral tale rises to a melancholy spirituality.
GOOD "Brokeback Mezuzah": Tender, affecting, brave, and beautifully wrought,
GOOD Brave, provocative and gently engrossing with well-nuanced performances.
GOOD It moves slowly and patiently through the ordeal of a single soul, illuminating in the process a cosmos of intense and hidden feeling.
FAIR Quiet, sober and tense, the movie makes some interesting points, but it lacks the emotional firepower of Brokeback Mountain.
FAIR The drama's moments of inspiration vindicate its desultory proceedings.
FAIR Haim Tabakman's feature directing debut fascinates for the powerful, multi-layered themes that percolate beneath its visually spare and delicately told story.
GOOD Unusually sensitive look into the hearts of nonconformists in an extremely conforming community as the different risks they take and the choices they make are quite moving.
FAIR Bellocchio famously took on the Catholic Church and the Italian family in his frenetic first film ... Now 40 years later, Bellocchio's attack on the same institutions is calmer and more temperate.
FAIR Enigmatic and mesmerizing.
FAIR An artful look at religious hypocrisy, interfamily dynamics and the way people wrestle with personal history long after the original events are over.
FAIR It's a bit of a mess but strong stuff nevertheless.
FAIR Exceptionally handsome, somber film.
BAD It's almost as if screenwriter/director Marco Bellocchio wants to exorcise personal demons rather than entertain.
FAIR The quizzically abrupt ending leaves [too many] questions, and the viewer, hanging.
FAIR It is a riveting, rich portrait of an atheist who thinks he's resistant to faith but may be in the throes of a feverish conversion.
GOOD Bellocchio's complex drama is held together by the tight and focused performance of Castellitto.
FAIR It's a sly, subtle portrait of systematic hypocrisy (try to count the number of times faith is referred to as an 'insurance policy') and the mysterious way fate binds children to their parents.
FAIR An edgy drama unwinds with an emotional letdown.
GOOD This superbly filmed Italian drama stands with Bellocchio's best work.
GOOD Marco Bellocchio's expansive, memorable film floats and plummets like a box kite in a storm on drafts of melodrama, mysticism and humor.
FAIR My Mother's Smile overflows with mildly interesting ideas and characters, but the end result is decidedly tepid.
FAIR Flawed but fascinating portrait of Vatican politics.
FAIR Bellocchio has a way of spelling everything out for the audience; nonetheless, the film's intellectualism is both provocative and remarkably playful.
BAD Lessons about social responsibility are submerged in a bubble bath of innocent glamour; Amy Heckerling's Clueless looks like a mordant social satire by comparison.
BAD Even Anjelica Huston as a rival cosmetics magnate struggles to inject any venom into the proceedings.
BAD Welcome to adulthood, Hillary and Haylie Duff. Here are your T-Mobile Sidekicks and Tabloid news stories. Leave your personalities at the door.
BAD A brain-numbing, fluffy flick for tweens.
BAD An insipid mess not worthy of the tweens who flock to such flicks.
BAD Along the way, self-discovery bangs 'em over the head.
BAD The Duff sisters are pleasant personalities, but the vapid bimbosity of their characters quickly becomes grating.
BAD Forced to endure such casually offensive nonsense, the viewer ends up slumming it far more than the duff protagonists.
BAD Watchable enough and by no means as bad as The Perfect Man, although there's not much here that'll interest the over-12s.
BAD Messy, patronising and tonally confused, this vanity project - timed to co-incide with Hilary Duff's perfume launch - quite frankly stinks.
BAD "This thing is screwier than Courtney Love!" whimpers Hilary in her usual chihuahua-on-helium whine. Even she, however, manages to shine next to her aggravating older sister, saddled as she is with all the comic timing of a mortally wounded elephant.
BAD Haylie and sister Hilary Duff just don't have the comedy stylings to sell this half-baked story of heiress sisters battling to save their dad's cosmetics empire from ruin.
BAD seems more of an ode to Paris and Nicky Hilton than a decent vehicle for these sisters
BAD Frankly movies like Material Girls sicken me; they're base and soulless and entirely unworthy of the celluloid they were filmed upon.
BAD The villain (a greedy corporate man of some sort) isn't very fleshed out, but it's hard to believe that he's any worse than the two self-serving, appearance-obsessed protagonists, with whom the film asks young girls everywhere to identify.
BAD Martha Coolidge's direction treats the whole adventure with more respect than it deserves, which also makes one wish that she'd been able to work with the Duffs on something much more worthwhile.
BAD As if one Duff wasn't enough for us.
BAD I liked it better with Brittany Murphy.
BAD The fact is, neither Hilary nor Haylie have any flair for subtle comedy.
BAD It's sort of reassuring that although Madge has seemingly given up starring in bad movies, her company is still financing terrible scripts.
BAD The movie, which was not screened for critics, makes a joke of everyone who isn't wealthy, white and pencil thin.
BAD The scariest part of Material Girls comes when you're sitting in the dark theater and start considering the possibility that young women might find these characters sympathetic.
BAD finally drives a Duff vehicle into the land of beguilingly awful.
BAD You might remember it from May when it starred Lindsay Lohan and was called Just My Luck.
BAD This is indeed one dumb film.
BAD Stays true to its name, all right, but there's no reason the film also had to be an embarrassingly unfunny and aimless chore to sit through.
BAD A superficial tween comedy that mocks celebutantes like the Olsen twins while simultaneously pushing stars Hilary and Haylie Duff as their replacements.
BAD Light but listless.
FAIR There is no edge to the movie at all, and that blandness will render it forgettable to anyone over the age of 12 or so, but for all that, it is pleasant enough, and occasionally even fun.
BAD Madonna's anthem was only good-naturedly arrogant, but the SoCal twins, like the film's script, are arrogant, ghastly immature and offensive to any audience that isn't all of the above.
BAD Nonsensical from the get-go, the girls' fish-out-of-water routine grows interminable.
BAD The film opens with the Duffs huffing and puffing their way through a remake of Madonna's 'Material Girl,' an ode to gold digging that Madonna sang with a touch of wry humor; the Duffs perform it as if it was 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'
FAIR a safe, enjoyable movie that can be watched by yourself, on a date or at your mother's house after Sunday dinner
BAD It teeters between pleasantly generic film biography and rank manipulation.
FAIR You could go see this just to enjoy the production design.
GOOD Diane Lane delivers one of the finest performances of her career.
BAD Secretariat is cliched, unrealistic and predictable, but it will make you feel good
FAIR This horse-sports-opera boasts all the ingredients for a successful run.
FAIR Celebrates greatness on four legs with a decent--if not record-breaking--amount of light entertainment. What're the odds?
FAIR Easily as good of a film as "Seabiscuit," and family-friendly.
FAIR A heavily contrived and overlong account of the greatest US horse in racing history, Disney's Secretariat still has a lot going for it as an old-fashioned family drama.
BAD Secretariat is a good-natured but thunderingly cliched triumph-against-the-odds tale, almost every line a cornball aphorism about following your heart.
BAD Like Secretariat himself, the film is a glossy, big-hearted slow- starter, but lacks his ability to power home ahead of the competition.
BAD I'm sick of the simpering American morons who lap up this rubbish.
FAIR With its linear structure, nostalgic glow and distinct lack of surprises, Secretariat seems to have wandered into cinemas after leaving its TV movie hitching post.
BAD Just when we thought John Malkovich didn't have another semi-intentionally deranged performance left in him, he has come storming back with another uproarious turn...
GOOD I think this is one of the year's most enjoyable family films.
BAD Despite a decent performance from Lane as the homespun trainer, Secretariat is more blind alley than Blind Side.
BAD This tale of wealth, horse-breeding and good old Christian faith is just about as hammy as a study of commodified horse sex can be.
BAD Secretariat's story still feels untold.
BAD Don't put money on it.
BAD Bum-numbingly long bore that has a worrying number of talented actors seemingly involved for a cheque. Watch a film about dinosaurs instead; much more fun.
FAIR This horsey, 1970s-set Disney film doesn't boast the most imaginative script and is too long and businesslike for youngsters -- yet it still produces a lump in the throat.
BAD Disappointing, frequently dull racehorse drama that's let down by poorly written characters, a thinly stretched plot, a painful lack of dramatic tension and a cliche-heavy script.
FAIR Yes, it's a good, solid movie about a horse that no one expected to win.
FAIR Penny Chenery's story is good stuff. It's just that watching it, one can't escape the nagging feeling that it's not the most compelling part of the (Secretariat) story.
GOOD ... you will believe a horse can act.
BAD Secretariat is basically an amiable crowd pleaser. It's a good film about a great horse.
FAIR If you like sweet, safe tales of triumph, Secretariat is a sure bet. But if you like films with a bit more tension and complexity, this romp doesn't completely satisfy.
GOOD ...oldstyle Hollywood, family entertainment done at a very high level. It doesn't lay out all the facts and complications, but it's a very honest movie.
FAIR Despite the Disney-fied, sentimental side of the story, 'Secretariat' hits the finish line as an effective tale about an amazing equine athlete
FAIR Well-crafted, shamelessly -- and obviously -- manipulative fantasyland stuff, passing itself off as a 'true story,' when, in fact, it's what we call 'fact-based.
BAD Watching Secretariat is an experience as antithetical to watching an actual horse race as it gets.
BAD Schmaltzy, uneven and contrived [despite] thrilling horse-racing scenes and John Malkovich's hilarious performance as an eccentric trainer who walked right out of a Christopher Guest movie.
FAIR The horse's story entertains but it would have been nice to have more of the owner's personal life explored
BAD Crushingly unexceptional.
BAD It's not about a horse, it's jockey, or it's trainer. It's about a horse owner. Instead of honoring the greatest race horse ever, they try to find an underdog story with Diane Lane's help.
FAIR Secretariat rides to the Winner's Circle.
FAIR Like most Disney features, it is an inspirational event that will touch everyone.
GOOD A throwback to an era where Disney churned these things out by the dozen, you?ll cheer, you?ll laugh, and wish you?d brought a hanky. There is, however, no photo finish.
FAIR Until the Sports Illustrated subscription runs out at the Walt Disney Studios offices, I expect audiences will continue to be privy to cookie-cutter yarns centered around notable achievements in the sports world.
GOOD As good as The Ring is, it can't top the original for sheer, shivering terror.
GOOD A sure, stealthy shocker which certainly primes you for the sequel.
FAIR David Cronenberg could perhaps compete with Nakata but unfortunately only lesser mortals have attempted to replicate the feeling that Reiko has plunged into something with which even her psychic powers can't compete.
GOOD Ring has indescribably disturbing moments that frightened me out of my wits. But like many of the Japanese horrors that followed, it sometimes has an elliptic and confusing storytelling style that can make plot-progression muddy.
FAIR The original retains its power to chill, although in the age of the DVD and the download, the idea of a haunted video cassette seems positively archaic.
GOOD The finale, too, still feels as twisted, bizarre and down-right nightmarish as it did all those years ago.
GOOD Subtly expressive faces and spooky interiors are the order of the day in this original, powerful treat.
GOOD A landmark in horror cinema, Japan's Ring is arguably the most chilling pieces of popular supernatural cinema of the 90s.
BAD Bog standard horror offering with a distinct lack of action or plot.
GOOD A blockbuster in Japan, this restrained horror film crosses urban legend conventions with Asian ghost story traditions, and the results are truly spooky.
GOOD It hit something primal in me, turning me into a quivering ball of nerves; my 'fight or flight' switch was turned to flight and then broken off.
GOOD It's hard to fairly judge a film like RINGU when you've seen the remake first. Many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity, [yet] are worthwhile.
FAIR Neither inferior nor superior to the Hollywood version.
GOOD Good ol' urban legend stuff.
GOOD Contando com uma premissa curiosa, o filme mergulha o espectador em um clima de forte suspense, culminando em um desfecho que certamente fica na memoria.
GOOD contrasting the original Ringu with the current Americanized adaptation is akin to comparing The Evil Dead with Evil Dead II
GOOD If it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with Ring, an indisputably spooky film; with a screenplay to die for.
FAIR If nothing else, this movie introduces a promising, unusual kind of psychological horror.
GOOD Even if it's been tailor made for Japanese schoolgirls, it still had me screaming like one.
FAIR As an historical reenactment it suffers from a great deal of simplification in order to make complex events quickly and easily understandable, and as a drama it suffers from a great deal of build that never really pays on it's promise.
BAD While the performances keep the film afloat, Kapur's over indulgent direction and his inadequate interpretation of history comes dangerously close to running it aground.
BAD odaje sve nedostatke i ograni%u010Denja olovnih vremena u kojima je nastao
GOOD Every shot, every costume is decadent with color, and every single twitch of Blanchett's face is imbued with meaning as she negotiates her way through her warring roles of being a woman and being a queen.
BAD But saddled with this dopey script, [Blanchett] is stuck pulling a series of poses and wearing one ornate gown after another.
FAIR Blanchett is again director Shekhar Kapur's greatest asset. His weakness is his tendency to fall back on silly, melodramatic contrivance better suited to popcorn fare than to a believable meditation on Elizabethan England.
GOOD Betrayal, war, love triangles and most importantly, Cate Blanchett proves to be able to capture strength, anger and sadness better...
FAIR This is an epic, to be sure, but it is also a melodrama, a soap opera of titanic scale and bluster.
BAD Figurinos, direcao de arte e fotografia sao exuberantes, mas fica ate dificil apreciar a performance de Cate Blanchett em meio a um roteiro tao estupido e a direcao "olhem-pra-mim-sou-Cecil-B.-DeMille!" de Shekhar Kapur.
BAD Menos interesante y mas rutinaria que la primera Elizabeth (de 1998), esta segunda parte vale la pena mas que nada por otra brillante composicion de Cate Blanchett.
BAD a muddle that subsumes [its] premise in a mighty attempt to be several things all at once, with an uneven delivery
FAIR ... fearsome and passionate with its visual flair, but incredibly confused as to how it wants to address Elizabeth's life beyond what has already been realized.
GOOD "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" is a worthy sequel to "Elizabeth". Cate Blanchett delivers the same performance that earned her so much praise the first time around. The epic feel harkens back to Hollywood's Golden Age.
BAD The elaborate costumes and set decoration provide the only interest.
BAD Unreliable as history and misguided as a contemporary allegory, Golden Age finally fails because it is a half-hearted spectacle, not even filmed in a widescreen format.
FAIR Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth sequel is a beautifully shot, impeccably designed and largely entertaining drama, providing you're not a stickler for historical accuracy.
GOOD If this is a film that irritates nearly as much as it pleases, we do get a sense of the times, and of the lady in question. The eyes, if not the brain, are certainly given a workout that they will remember.
FAIR See it anyway for Blanchett's soulful modulation between queenly command and womanly anguish.
BAD Where Kapur's first Elizabeth was cool, cerebral, fascinatingly concerned with complex plotting, the new movie is pitched at the level of a Jean Plaidy romantic novel.
GOOD Rich in colour, sumptuous costumes, political intrigues and the personal relationships which dominate Elizabeth once more.
FAIR Kapur's film is visually arresting, each frame a work of art in miniature. But there is something rather breathless about the storytelling.
FAIR Despite all that's going for it, you can't help thinking this movie could have been so much better.
BAD A handsome but shallow sequel.
BAD The film is just about worth seeing for the wigs and costumes. But Elizabeth: The Golden Age sank without trace in American cinemas, and I fear it will do the same here.
FAIR A lesser movie compared to its 1998 predecessor, this sequel nonetheless delivers the sort of stirring drama and sweeping spectacle its subject demands. Blanchett, meanwhile, shines brightly enough in the title role to make Elizabeth III a certainty.
BAD Making soap of statecraft, the film has plenty of juicy moments, but offers an inconsistent rather than complex view of Elizabeth.
FAIR Sidelines Sir Francis Drake in favour of the dashing Raleigh, nicely summing up the film: all flash, very little bang.
FAIR Over-indulgent and melodramatic, as is the nature of artistic mythmaking, The Golden Age will beguile and repel in equal measure. The performances are supreme, although some viewers may struggle to reconcile the director's epic intentions.
GOOD Even though the script plays fast and loose with historical facts, that indomitable bulldog spirit rings true and holds you captive for the duration.
FAIR It's flawed and it does feel longer because the big finale is less like a battle and more like an on-screen version of battleship, but Cate and Clive are still worth a look.
BAD Want to know what a gifted actress Cate Blanchett is? Watch her keep a straight face throughout Elizabeth: The Golden Age.
FAIR The film is beautifully shot, filling the screen with brightly saturated hues that give it an almost fairy tale-like visual sense, rather like a series of Pre-Raphaelite paintings brought to life.
FAIR okay, but more silver than gold this time out.
BAD The script is the flowery prose of an overly earnest high school student.
BAD The movie contains the usual palace intrigue and overblown dialogue. The only line missing is the one referring to Elizabeth as a "king in petticoats."
FAIR Golden Age starts well, and with sharp wit and crisp dialogue. But as the story moves toward the tentative romance with Raleigh, the film drifts into melodrama...
FAIR Bigger and more exciting than its intimate predecessor.
BAD Breasts heave and the sea storms as historical music swells in Shekhar Kapur's overwrought follow-up to Elizabeth.
BAD There are movies that are so bad they're good, and then there are movies that are so bad they're completely awesome.
FAIR Cate the Great once again imbues the Queen with her captivating mix of steely strength, regal dignity, take-no-crap toughness, and intimate vulnerability.
FAIR The air of Gallic nonchalance ensures you have a lot of fun watching Pinon and Ardant match wits. It's Dana, however, who anchors the story.
FAIR An engaging, enjoyable slice of suspense from the French.
BAD Is it supposed to be funny, tragic or what? Even the characters don't seem too sure.
BAD Red herrings abound and audience frustration sets in. It's a pity because the film looks good and the Gilbert Becaud songs on the soundtrack are easy on the ear.
FAIR It's filled with intriguing characters, it has a fascinating initial premise -- and then it runs off the rails.
GOOD The ever-appealing Fanny Ardant and the enigmatic, pug-faced character actor Dominique Pinon have many subtle delights up their sleeves, and newcomer Audrey Dana is a revelation.
GOOD ... about the creation of fiction, the way we spin lies together into a simulacrum of life - if there's any philosophical point of view beyond that it's that every narrative is necessarily an abridgment of truth.
GOOD What's especially clever about the plotting is that anything that proves to be merely a red herring is then incorporated into another storyline.
FAIR If this kind of storytelling is your cup of absinthe, Claude Lelouch makes it easy to sip appreciatively.
GOOD In many ways, Lelouch's film is -- in its somewhat old-fashioned way (which isn't a pejorative) -- the most bracing dose of cinema I've seen all year.
FAIR Provides one of the year's more memorable movie moments: a simple shot of a barn, overlaid with both the soothing crooning of a Gilbert Becaud pop song and the terrified squeals of a hog being slaughtered.
FAIR Even if the game isn't entirely successful, it's fun to play along.
FAIR It's intellectually cagey, potentially romantic, and, above all, an entertaining puzzle box of duplicitous people doing mysterious things, men and women.
FAIR As fizzy and non-nutritive as a glass of sparkling wine, Roman de Gare is a crowd-pleasing blend of romance, farce and mystery that plays out a little like a Ruth Rendell mystery novel with Rendell herself as the chief suspect.
GOOD Forty years after his breakout success as a filmmaker, Claude Lelouch makes something of a comeback with his playful and sexy whodunit, Roman de Gare.
FAIR With elements of road movie, thriller and comedy as well as other genres, Tracks possesses a freewheeling appeal.
FAIR Entertaining despite nearly fatal plot holes.
FAIR I think I understand the alternative realities of the plot, and I concede the loose ends are tied up, sort of, but I didn't care.
GOOD Don't go to the theater expecting too much and you can't help but leave with a smile on your face.
FAIR Lelouch's deft touch with various cinematic styles, however surface, enables him to interweave pastoral elegy, quirky social comedy and thriller with fluid ease.
GOOD An ingenuous knot of plot, expertly tangled, in which nothing is quite what it seems.
FAIR Pinon and Dana are so striking together.
FAIR Succeeds as a mystery, comedy and romance in unexpected ways.
GOOD It's the smartest and best suspense movie you're likely to see for a while.
FAIR Thanks to the able cast and crisp cinematography, it's mostly unpretentious and reasonably entertaining.
FAIR In quite a balancing act, [Lelouch] has written a script that's a thriller, somber romantic comedy, and, for the first half, a tense road movie.
FAIR Lelouch's film is the cinematic equivalent, enjoyable fluff that your mind will discard after the closing credits -- but worth seeing nevertheless.
FAIR Begin Again is a delight, not only because of its infectious musical vitality but because it follows the unexpected forks in the road.
FAIR It's not nearly as good as "Once" but still very charming and entertaining.
FAIR John Carney's retread never gets close to replicating the stunning emotional core of Once. But for those seeing Begin Again from a fresh perspective, it's ( ... ) a more light-hearted ( ... ) alternative to the Coen Bros' Inside Llewyn Davis.
FAIR The best thing about 'Begin Again' is what it's not. It's not a love story, or at least not a conventional love story; it's more of a friendship story between a man and a woman, which is something we almost never see in movies.
FAIR I've seen happier endings in Oklahoma! and Singin' in the Rain, but this one feels genuine - and in an unexpected way, deeply satisfying.
FAIR Knightley (supplying her own vocals, more than just competently so, by the way) and Ruffalo have a casual chemistry that works, and Levine is (perhaps unsurprisingly) totally right as a self-absorbed jerk.
GOOD I really enjoyed this. It's such a nice surprise, because so many so-called feel-good romantic comedies these days are pretty ordinary but there's something special about this because there's a level of reality to it in the performances in the situations.
GOOD There's a freshness to this film.
GOOD Bonds born out of art, and specifically music, are nothing new in the movies, but Carney conveys the uniquely exhilarating romance of the creative process behind art like no other filmmaker.
GOOD John Carney is not afraid of a cliche. After all, Begin Again is a musical, a genre that has always thrived on them. And he does know how to shape them to his own design, which is low-key and slightly tongue-in-cheek.
FAIR Thankfully Begin Again doesn't take the predictable routes; it seems to actively reject the easy romantic tropes.
GOOD People who love music, people who love great films, and people who love both, are sure to love 'Begin Again,' an exquisite film by John Carney, who wrought the equally superb 'Once.'
FAIR You'll find a mismatched pair to pull for and a lot of sincerity in this musical romance by the creator of Once.
GOOD In its best moments - which are not infrequent - is appealing mostly on the backs of watching interesting, capable people going on with their business in an engaged, focused manner.
GOOD This is the kind of film that lifts your spirits. If you've had a bad day or are generally feeling down, it will cheer you up. If you're already feeling happy, it will make you even happier.
FAIR ...breezy and consistently watchable...
GOOD a light and dancing comedy about fresh starts
FAIR A mostly pleasant but deeply flawed little film that gets by on its stars and a sense of generosity.
GOOD I found it moving, funny and really rather charming, provoking more than enough laughter and tears to dispel my underlying anxieties about the "live" performances.
FAIR The wholesome, hopeful, let's-put-on-a-show enthusiasm may sound hokey but it's actually infectiously joyful. At the same time, Carney roughs up the edges just enough to make this fairy tale seem somewhat accessible and realistic.
GOOD The result is a film that, while fitting into various great traditions, still bears the unmistakable thumbprint of a singular film-maker.
GOOD Carney's latest isn't quite the equal of Once, but who could have twice bottled that lightning?
FAIR Irish writer-director John Carney is a master at depicting musicians on the cusp of something special.
FAIR This soulful outing is sure to please music lovers. And isn't that everyone?
GOOD Keira Knightley sings and so does the movie!
GOOD A decent feel-good flick that features also decent music. The real reason to see it is the acting especially that of Mark Ruffalo who gives a career best performance.
GOOD A cheery charmer that brings a smile to the face.
GOOD Fans of Once - or, indeed, anyone with a heart - will be swept away by the gentle, sweet-but-sad story.
FAIR Begin Again is a not-entirely-successful movie about not selling out; it's a theme that must concern Carney deeply.
GOOD It's a movie that is painfully sincere and free of guile, with as close to a happy ending as these characters could ever get. If you like musicals, well, here's a good one.
FAIR The gentle lightning of Once doesn't strike twice for Carney, but his latest music movie has charm beneath its slick surface - and Knightley and Ruffalo harmonise just fine.
FAIR Keira Knightley plays Greta, a Norah Jones-like singer-songwriter... It's a typically brave performance from an actress who is always prepared to try anything.
FAIR At times, the scenes are so canned they feel like soap opera. But the movie does have its fair share of decent moments thanks to Ruffalo and co-star Catherine Keener.
BAD It's all a bit easy - though quite nicely performed - and Knightley is never entirely convincing ...
FAIR Can a meaningful glance mean as much as a kiss? In this film, it can, and that's enough.
FAIR No matter how thin the drama, or thick the performances, the film's firefly-in-a-jar, midsummer night's whimsy and heart-on-its-sleeve optimism hath charms ...
FAIR Keira Knightley brings a sweet soul to John Carney's delightful sort-of sequel to his low-fi hit, Once.
FAIR The film is a fairy tale: sentimental but enjoyable if you put a few protective fingers in front of your face to avoid being slurped to death.
BAD John Carney returns with another feature-length music video, turning the surprising charm of his debut, Once, a novel take on the modern musical romance, into a shameless gimmick. Just call it Twice.
FAIR Knightley's bullish Britishness and Ruffalo's bruised charm provide a pleasingly gentle, unsentimental chemistry and, heck, there's even James Corden on a kazoo.
FAIR They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but it can make for some awfully dull films. The line between inspiration and imitation is fine crossed repeatedly. Pride and Glory isn't the worst offender, just the latest.
BAD No button remains unpushed, no shred of scenery remains unshredded and no F-bomb remains unuttered.
FAIR Pride and Glory doesn't add anything to the generic crooked-cop procedural that we haven't seen with more verve in better movies.
FAIR This predictable police corruption story with an A-list cast explores themes of family and honesty as two cop brothers uncover the dirt on their brother-in-law's violent activity, while senior cop Dad tries to keep things under control.
FAIR Uma pena que o filme jamais consiga escapar realmente do lugar comum, implodindo de vez em seu terrivel terceiro ato.
BAD Hard to watch, hard to listen to and hard to follow.
BAD The actors in Pride and Glory do their best with this cliched material, but the film is so grim, ugly and miserable that it's difficult to sympathise with even the most positive characters.
FAIR Director and co-writer Gavin O'Connor is the son of a former New York policeman, and displays a strong grasp of the familial and fraternal ties that bind his characters together.
FAIR While its kinetic appeal does have a numbing - if temporary effect - on your critical faculties, television has been much more successful in claiming this territory as its own.
BAD Relentlessly dour, filled with unsympathetic characters, and made out of cardboard melodrama. It's the last of those sins that is unforgivable. [Blu-ray]
BAD ...only skims the surface of its characters and offers nothing new in the way of corrupt law enforcement.
FAIR Elevated by superb performances, led by Edward Norton and a very chilling Colin Farrell.
BAD What's especially lamentable is that this movie strands yet another exemplary turn by Edward Norton, who once again is superior to the material surrounding him.
BAD Pride and Glory is a bleak, boring and hopelessly familiar corrupt cop story that simply does not work despite the determined, top-of-their-game efforts of O'Connor and Norton, not to mention Colin Farrell, Jon Voight and others.
FAIR A well-acted and tightly structured piece that would be more impactful if there weren't a feeling that we've seen it before.
BAD Bloody, violent and increasingly derivative, 'Pride and Glory' betrays its initial promise as a small-scale, 'Godfather'-esque social tapestry with crude plotting, variable acting and an all-too-guessable storyline and conclusion.
BAD Solid yet unremarkable, Pride And Glory will never win points for originality. With committed turns from Norton and Farrell, it does enough - just - to keep you interested. But this is one film that neither covers itself in pride or glory.
BAD A detonation of flatulent, macho-sentimental gibberish is what this ugly and violent film positively farts out of the screen at you.
BAD But, hackneyed, unconvincing and ultimately preposterous, Pride and Glory should be made to hand in its badge.
GOOD It doesn't quite pack the wallop that O'Connor intended, a daft fight near the end may evoke laughs and it probably won't be storming the Academy, but don't be shocked if you enjoy this as much as Marty's Oscar victor.
BAD Here's an excruciatingly dated and derivative New York cop movie.
FAIR After similar but much better fare such as Martin Scorsese's The Departed and The Wire TV series, we've come to expect an awful lot from our bent copper dramas and, while satisfactory, Pride And Glory just isn't in the same league.
BAD When Noah Emmerich, who plays Tierney's NYPD brother, said "this s*** ends now", the Sneak thought "glory be" - only for the story to drag on for another 20 minutes.
FAIR This bad-apple cop drama is the kind of movie that Sidney Lumet used to make in the Seventies and Eighties, and it hasn't evolved a great deal since.
BAD However skilful Gavin O'Connor is as a film-maker - and there are some striking sequences here - we've seen this corrupt cop thriller a hundred times before.
FAIR Watchable cop thriller with strong performances and suitably gritty direction, but the climax gets bogged down in some embarrassingly awful cliches.
BAD If cop movie cliches are a crime against cinema, Pride and Glory should be under arrest.
BAD Christmas is definitely cancelled in this over-acted, over-here movie. Presumably the tinsel was CGI'd in to complement the season of its release.
BAD passionate performances in a story that is a series of letter-perfect cliches
GOOD A dramatic, tense story of mixed loyalties in an NYPD family with standout performances by Norton, Farrell, Voight, Emmerich, and Ehle.
GOOD Relentlessly grim, appropriately abrasive and beautifully filmed, "Pride and Glory" recalls Sidney Lumet's heyday. It proves there's still meat left on the bones of bad-cop thrillers, but it wisely doesn't offer a Handi-Wipe after its final course.
BAD It's a tale you've seen a good 100 times before, and if only 85 of those 100 are actually better than Pride and Glory, the other 15 aren't any worse.
FAIR I'm not sure how many times the F bomb gets dropped, but it's more than you'll hear it in the average R-rated drama.
BAD Pride and Glory: Cops arrested by cliches.
FAIR Run of the mill cop drama elevated only by the acting of the supporting cast - Jennifer Ehle is heartbreaking
BAD Norton and Farrell are both too good to have been shortchanged by this been-there-done-that script.
FAIR That noise you hear is the soundtrack of We Own the Night, which is playing next door in the multiplex of your memory. Yes, there are undeniable similarities between the two pictures.
BAD Marijuana legalization is a hot button issue, ripe for boundary-pushing humor. Don't Legalize It oddly pulls back at the very moment when it should be charging forward with all its might.
BAD Given how established their roles are, Don't Legalize It could really use some sort of narrative pull, but it is mostly just content to stand in the middle and watch everyone circle in their fitfully funny ruts.
BAD It gets as stale as pot left too long in the freezer.
FAIR You've got to take your toque off to a dumb movie that is clever enough to try to rook Ottawa politicians into doing the right thing for the wrong reason.
BAD It's tolerable because director Mike Clattenburg, who created the series, overlays the stumblebum ineptitude with a layer of affection.
GOOD ...a crazed road trip to Chuckleville.
GOOD Excellent updating of the classic drama
GOOD Not nearly as good as the original, but still an incredible film.
GOOD Nowhere near the original, but still worthy of high praise.
FAIR This remake is worth viewing for the strength of the script and the fine performances.
BAD Where's the media attention and the constant attempts to take advantage of the poor girl? Even the lackluster Nell got that right.
BAD Cool! clearly aspires to be in the tradition of lost-boys masterpieces Los Olvidados and Pixote, but is too exploitative to succeed as a cautionary tale and too cautious to succeed as an exploitation picture.
GOOD Here, finally, Clark takes the skankiness out of teen sex, making it into a romantic idyll.
FAIR Because the filmmakers cook up an equal number of touching sequences to match their disturbing ones, their portrait of disturbed America comes through clearly and effectively.
BAD well-shot, but it is the only good thing that could be said about KEN PARK
FAIR Ken Park leads viewers, fans, and detractors to wonder, "What the hell is this guy doing?"
BAD Pornografia infantil disfarcada de "arte".
FAIR Less a film than a moment in time--at least that's what Ken Park's dreamy bookends would have you believe.
BAD Parental figures are one-dimensional. Behavior becomes extreme and absurd, making the film laughable.
BAD The film is fascinating, but sort of like watching a road accident.
BAD The worst film I've seen since... Well, "Bully".
GOOD Makes Happiness look like Dumbo.
GOOD A savage attack on American comfort.
GOOD functions equally well as revenge drama, moral fable, and no-holds-barred condemnation of dog-eat-dog capitalism
FAIR Dassin's film emerges as a rather searing, wide-reaching indictment of the necessary evils of doing business in the United States
GOOD Dassin swathes Thieves' Highway's long-haul boys in claustrophobic compositions and menacing darkness.
GOOD Nothing is put together for you, but all the pieces of the puzzle are there for you to create what you want. It's refreshing to see a movie that is completely out of the box, and doesn't follow any present forumla. THE WALL is a great rock opera.
GOOD Visually stunning and disturbing, an essential midnight movie.
GOOD A stunning portrayal of a slide from isolation into madness. And the music rocks, too--bonus.
BAD One of Alan Parker's few truly bad movies.
GOOD Visually stunning yet strangely forced tale.
FAIR dated and self-aggrandizing but a watershed
BAD Good music. Sick imagery.
GOOD A midnight movie classic!
FAIR Late Phases is a fun werewolf flick with a sweet, climactic last stand.
BAD Damici gives his memorable protagonist enough life to hold it together more often than it would have otherwise. He's great here. The movie around him, not so much.
BAD Late Phases transforms from laughably non-frightening horror film to self-serious family drama and back again, all the while remaining ferociously, ravenously boring.
FAIR Adrian Garcia Bogliano ends up merely toying with the death-steeped concerns of his characters, and taking the furious and bitter perspective that powers the narrative's ponderous dramatic core for granted.
BAD It's probably best to think of the film as an extended music video, a watershed moment for movie sound tracks, and not much more.
FAIR ...there is so much good music involved...it easily distracts one's mind from the clunky histrionics.
BAD The musical performances are memorable, everything else is forgettable
BAD Bland Prince vehicle that takes itself far too seriously.
FAIR intriguingly well-told story
BAD Those who are looking for a two-hour music video with a coherent story will not be disappointed.
GOOD The performers have a bit of a wink behind their performances, and so the artificiality meshes together neatly.
BAD Purple Rain shares a trump card--its set list--with casual Prince fans, who are advised to reach for the soundtrack album instead.
FAIR Purple Rain's gazillion-selling soundtrack album has more or less eclipsed the film in pop culture history books.
FAIR Short people of Hollywood...DANCE!
GOOD it isn't much of a movie, but it's one hell of a show
GOOD A classic '80s rock movie, whose soundtrack was perhaps the best album of the decade.
FAIR Prince is one of the most talented musicians of our time. His movie doesn't quite reflect that, but it's in Minneapolis, so it's cool.
FAIR So-so picture that is most notable for the terrific musical sequences featuring Prince and his band.
FAIR You'll have a rockin' good time!
BAD Where are all those people who called this "the Citizen Kane of rock movies" hiding?
FAIR Just as the relationships at the core of this drama, The Yellow Handkerchief is one big compromise. Make do with the lackluster parts and receive something uniquely pleasant.
FAIR A well-acted little film, The Yellow Handkerchief captures the loneliness of these characters and the sparks of hope they harbor, despite everything.
FAIR This uplifting film is an indie gem with a wonderful payoff that will bring you to tears. The acting is superlative and makes this emotionally moving experience good to the last drop.
BAD When The Yellow Handkerchief finally hooks into the meat of Hamill's source story, the narrative tension puts enough wind in the film's sails to arrive at its corny but sentimentally satisfying conclusion.
BAD The only positive thing about the aimless film The Yellow Handkerchief is the idea that William Hurt may be ready for his Jeff Bridges moment.
FAIR The unhurried direction of Udayan Prasad and the unafraid choices of the sure-footed cast keep this character-driven drama afloat.
FAIR The Yellow Handkerchief is a love story. Two, really. At its center is the sweetly fractured ticking of a broken heart on the mend.
FAIR The story arc of Handkerchief is entirely predictable, and the direction is pedestrian. But its pleasures are to be found in the graceful acting of Hurt and Bello...
FAIR This modest but moving indie ensemble piece puts three estimable actors in a convertible, sets them on a long drive to post-Katrina Louisiana and lets the character dynamics do the rest.
FAIR The Yellow Handkerchief is a surprisingly moving drama -- a throwback to the small, character-driven indies of yesteryear.
FAIR Even Stewart, an untutored colt of an actress who can toggle between natural grace and utter haplessness, finds her groove here.
FAIR You don't need an original story for a movie. You need original characters and living dialogue.
BAD Sluggish. Torpid. Boring.
BAD Prasad's take on the well-traveled folk tale (it didn't originate with Hamill -- he was just smart enough to put it down on paper) won't win any Oscars...
FAIR The sleepy scenery and charming performances -- Stewart escapes her vampires and reminds everyone what the fuss used to be about -- keep The Yellow Handkerchief from blowing it.
FAIR With tired eyes, a hesitant stoop and thinning hair, William Hurt makes only occasional appearances in films these days, but he's forgotten nothing about the kind of niche acting that informed his early work and won him a coveted Best Actor Oscar.
GOOD Kristen Stewart, just 17 at the time the movie was shot (several months before filming began on the first "Twilight" picture), navigates the swells of teenage confusion with precocious confidence.
BAD Director Udayan Prasad knows how to maximize tight spaces and closed-up characters, but Stewart underwhelms with her churlish pout and Southern twang, while Redmayne is simply annoying.
FAIR The romantic drama earns solid marks for atmosphere, moving shots of post-Katrina New Orleans and acting-few do sad-and-wise better than William Hurt-but each theme is hit a bit too hard and predictably.
GOOD Subtly powerful road trip film OK for most teens.
GOOD A road movie about three travelers in post-Katrina Louisiana and their quest to avoid a bleak and dark future.
GOOD Erin Dignam's episodic script, brimming with humor and honest emotion -- and the pitch-perfect direction of Udayan Prasad -- thankfully avoids manipulating the audience at every turn.
FAIR William Hurt, who specializes in playing high-strung, upscale neurotics, brings his formidable skills to The Yellow Handkerchief.
FAIR a refreshingly dimensional four-character ensemble piece
BAD Well-shot and well-acted, but also so consistently lightweight that it risks disappearing from the screen as you watch it.
BAD A wispy story of revelation that's blessed with gorgeously photographed Southern discomfort, and beset by on-the-nose dialogue and awkward time-shifting.
BAD The film fails to provide Kristen Stewart the courtesy of a role with scene-stealing potential.
GOOD [Arthur] Cohn has assembled a quartet of gifted actors who are captivating under Prasad's perceptive direction.
FAIR Yellow Handkerchief is just another quiet character piece that may make its way to theaters in limited release, but won't cause any waves.
FAIR Lots of fun....sexy, slick and surprisingly novel
GOOD Thrilling, touching adventure for animal lovers.
GOOD A lovely and unjustly forgotten family film.
FAIR Somehow makes the story of orphaned geese entertaining.
GOOD Story of a girl and her geese is complex entertainment for kids and grown-ups.
GOOD From bumbling infants to majestic adults, a flock hasn't been this charismatic onscreen since Hitchcock went bird-watching.
GOOD It's a genuine delight and a definite thumbs aloft for kids of about six upwards.
FAIR Beautiful looking and well acted, but lacking in the kind of tension that marks a well-told tale.
FAIR Jon Favreau's charismatic and convincing performance as the boxing legend is enough to recommend this biopic.
BAD Rocky Marciano was a knockout of a fighter to say the least. It's too bad Winkler's movie about him carries no particular punch
FAIR Every bit as cornball as it sounds.
GOOD If you have been with Jesse and Celine through the twists and turns, slips and stumbles of their romantic journey then their long, flowing, deceptively gripping conversations ripple with the realities of life.
GOOD Maybe we'll see more of them in another nine years. But if not, if things end here in this perfect trilogy, then that's enough to consider it as perhaps the greatest cinematic love story of all time.
GOOD The movie's funny at times and difficult at others, and ends absolutely perfectly. The best of the three.
GOOD Delpy and Hawke talk and talk and talk but it is all fascinating.
GOOD Like the Up series, a return to visit old friends
GOOD Making a movie with nothing more than smart dialogue and fine performances is a dying art, but Linklater, Hawke and Delpy remind us that it's a skill worth saving.
GOOD Before Midnight feels like the natural extension of the series, and will be everything fans of it could have hoped for.
FAIR The trouble with those first two film was their souffle-light scenarios...Here, however, things are much juicier as infidelity, commitment, divorce, resentment and all the other soul-sapping things that clock in when you hit your 40s come into play.
GOOD ...in the surprising third act, the film comes together as a plausible horror show of how good intentions and real affection can give way to vicious, realistic psychic combat. (
FAIR ...Before Midnight bears too few similarities to its thoroughly superior predecessors.
GOOD The release of each sequel is becoming an event, so it's particularly great to see Before Midnight not only meeting expectations but raising the bar.
FAIR Before Midnight is no romance. It's a horror movie.
GOOD Takes its traditional romantic tale into more insightful territories.
GOOD Hawk and Delpy know just how to get under your skin. Their onscreen alter egos fit like a glove, and witnessing their ageing, nagging, toying love is a true privilege.
GOOD What lifts Linklater's trilogy above your average dialogue-heavy indie is not just the intelligence of the conversation but its frankness and humor.
GOOD The 'Before' trilogy is a vacation for me. I am taken away, and it is never for long enough. I genuinely feel lucky to have these movies.
GOOD I'm not sure this is the end of Richard Linklater's 'Before' trilogy. It's perfection just as it is, but then again, Linklater has nine more years to work on the sequel.
GOOD Loving words mix with personal attacks, the magic moments with the unintended slights, as we witness the occasional desperation of imperfect people doing the best they can when life moves beyond meet-cute and courtship. That's authentic.
GOOD Linklater and his players bring an end to the fantasy and welcome the thrilling ups and bitter downs of reality to this love story.
GOOD The duo, clearly so comfortable in their characters' skin, indulge in intelligent banter, sharp humour and emotional truths.
GOOD So much better written than contemporary novels, this film is a literary as well as cinematic achievement to cherish. For grown-ups.
GOOD None of the films is faultless in itself, but, tinted with complementary tones, the complete cycle comes as close to perfection as any trilogy in cinema history.
GOOD It's been 18 years since Hawke, Delpy and Linklater introduced us to Jesse and Celine, and their story just gets richer, funnier and more punchy each time we see them. In 1995's Before Sunrise, they were idealistic 23-year-olds.
FAIR Hawke and Delpy are as believably real as any screen couple can ever be.
GOOD This is one of the few sequels for which the cliche 'eagerly awaited' is truly applicable.
GOOD Predictably, it's just as great as the first two.
FAIR By the end, Before Midnight inches towards a dawn of charm. But it's a troubled trip.
GOOD As an organic experiment in collaboration between actors and director, it is a triumph, co-created and co-owned by Delpy, Linklater and Hawke.
GOOD Hawke and Delpy, who are both credited on the script too, have never found co-stars to bounce off more nimbly or bring out richer nuances in their acting.
GOOD The performances and dialogue are wonderfully naturalistic; a reminder that the best special effects are often the cheapest.
GOOD Before Midnight is about the nature of long-term relationships, and the way love deepens and grows but also finds itself subject to the complications of maturity. Smart, insightful, and poignant.
GOOD For those who witnessed Jesse and Celine's tentative getting together as inter railing students almost twenty years ago, it's reassuring to see them still in love.
GOOD Brilliantly directed, superbly written and impeccably acted, this is a thoroughly enjoyable, thought-provoking and emotionally engaging drama that perfectly complements the previous two films.
GOOD It remains as engaging, illuminating, honest and funny as its predecessor; here's hoping we revisit Jesse and Celine in another decade or so.
FAIR Harris and Phifer's chemistry lends the inevitable tragedies some genuine punch.
GOOD "Paid In Full" is not the kind of movie that George W. Bush will ever see.
FAIR Stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation.
FAIR For a rapsploitation film to target and frown upon the darker forces of its nature is certainly a good sign for the maturation of the genre.
BAD The story is familiar from its many predecessors; like them, it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay.
FAIR If you saw it on TV, you'd probably turn it off, convinced that you had already seen that movie.
FAIR This familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences, though it's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times.
BAD Harris is supposed to be the star of the story, but comes across as pretty dull and wooden.
BAD A standard, run-of-the-mill drug drama.
BAD Needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance.
BAD Bottom-rung New Jack City wannabe.
FAIR Rings true, from the smooth dialogue to the unaffected performances of the central actors.
FAIR The movie is ambitious, has good energy and is well-acted, but tells a familiar story in a familiar way.
BAD In this bird's-eye-view of the drug trade circa 1986, there's something missing: the buyers.
BAD A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood, this movie strives to be more, but doesn't quite get there. Good performances keep it from being a total rehash.
FAIR Bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness.
FAIR Instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western, it's an unpretentious, sociologically pointed slice of life.
FAIR Suffers from a flat script and a low budget.
BAD It's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick.
FAIR An intelligent crime drama, not because of the criminal activity it dramatizes but because of its powerful examination of the forces that drive criminals.
FAIR Though filmed partly in Canada, Paid in Full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the Reagan years.
FAIR It's good, hard-edged stuff, violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done, morally alert and street-smart.
FAIR ...does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters' choices, good and ill, that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought.
FAIR Paid in Full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of Goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks.
FAIR Uneven script, but strong performances by a powerhouse cast.
FAIR A strained but nevertheless involving little personal drama about a delinquent's alleged murderous deed. Schroeder's suspense piece is arbitrary but satisfying thanks to the reliable leads.
BAD Despite Meryl Streep, Liam Neeson and the usually estimable Edward Furlong, this nonevent huffs and puffs to attain even the level of an ordinary motion picture.
BAD fares poorly when constrained to the screen
GOOD A slight yet profound exploration of generational choices and our fear of living our parents' lives.
GOOD Sweet and fiercely humane, Song's layered family portrait is decidedly Buddhist: silent when it needs to be and steadfast about approaching inevitable tragedy with care and patience.
FAIR Death hangs over Song Fang's first feature, Memories Look at Me, but it's neither with grimness nor overt tragedy.
FAIR Watching Memories's like listening to the secrets of this family's history.
GOOD Muscular if overwrought drama with great performances.
FAIR Loose, rambling and sometimes rudderless as it is, "The Indian Runner" has a fundamental honesty that gives it real substance.
FAIR Penn surrounds his brothers with supporting characters who are so well-realized, I'll remember them as long as I remember the leads.
GOOD There has never been a picture like David O. Selznick's production of Gone With the Wind.
GOOD Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh create their own sizzle as Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara in a lavish four-hour epic that juxtaposes scenes of jaw-dropping majesty with moments of elegant intimacy and playful verbal jousting.
GOOD No one watches Gone with the Wind for historical accuracy. What keeps us coming back is four-hours of epic romance in gorgeous Technicolor.
FAIR Too clumsy a thing to be taken seriously, with its romanticisation of slavery and its problematic approach to rape, Gone With The Wind is nevertheless a work of considerable power.
GOOD Running to nearly four hours and boasting at least three directors, this epic American Civil War romantic drama is more of a symbol of the Hollywood studio system than a mere movie.
FAIR The performances of eternally glittering movie stars Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable ... exist in a league of their own, demanding rapt attention in scene after scene.
GOOD Ginormous in both scale and emotional wallop, MGM's epic is still a cinematic event to be savoured.
GOOD Brimming with colour and passion, it pulls its emotional kick from tremendous performances, not least from Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable as the love-hate lovers.
FAIR The golden standard for classic Hollywood bombast, this one.
FAIR If ever the phrase, "They don't make 'em like they used to" could fit a film, this is it.
GOOD The epic film that to this day stands as the benchmark against which all other epics are judged.
GOOD Gone with the Wind is still dated, but it's a dynamite kind of antiquity.
GOOD It's impossible not to be carried away by the rich arterial force of this storytelling.
GOOD Grand old Hollywood at its most magnificent and melodramatic. Say what you like about the soapy characterisation and plotting, the spectacle flattens all in its wake.
GOOD A lost Hollywood art: the epic melodrama.
GOOD Terrificly acted, staged and designed, Gone WIth the Wind remains one of the greatest period epics ever filmed.
GOOD Despite the star power of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, Wind has lost some of its bluster, yet it survives as a glorious Technicolored window into America's dusty, bygone past.
GOOD It's so full of iconic moments of plotting and dialog that a feature film could be edited just out of the most quotable moments.
GOOD ...producer David O. Selznick's crowning achievement and a film that stands up as one of the screen's finest classics.
GOOD One of the classic films that defined American cinema, Gone With the Wind is a rare example of a collaboration involving hundreds of talents and egos that turned out great.
GOOD Never, never bores me. Glabe is fabulous!
FAIR Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara remain the greatest pairing of irresistible force and immovable object in Hollywood romance.
GOOD Treat yourself to one of the greatest cinematic experiences ever created.
GOOD The brilliant epitome of corporate filmmaking.
GOOD Often, older movies are a bit naive and unthreatening, but this movie is surprisingly fierce and somber.
GOOD Mind-boggling for the first time in a theater. Too bad that many, like me, see it first on TV.
GOOD It could be -- and should be -- viewed from a dozen different perspectives, but it is, above all, a story about adapting to the most challenging circumstances possible.
GOOD Clear an evening and indulge yourself in one of the few films that can justifiably be called an epic.
GOOD The best remembered and most publicized film in Hollywood's flamboyant history, the biggest of David O. Selznick's grand obsessions, and quite probably the most beloved movie of all time.
GOOD The passionate saga of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, played out against the flaming red backdrop of the Civil War, generates enough romance, historic drama and deep emotion to fuel a dozen great films.
GOOD Everything about it is big.
GOOD Victor Fleming's 60-year-old movie looks like it was shot this year.
FAIR What it loses in novelty and subtlety it makes up for in its earnest depiction of love and individual human decency in the face of societal cruelty.
FAIR Dealing with the Balkan wars, this ambitious and compassionate art film interweaves three stories (one set in London) that contrast the calm beauty of the Macedonian landscape with the harowing violence that erups within its borders.
FAIR Unfortunately not the masterpiece I hoped for, but still a thought-provoking trio of intertwined stories set in the war-torn Balkans.
GOOD Impecable.
FAIR Ostensibly a courtroom drama, Black or White is actually one of the most sensitive and intelligent introspections of American race relations in quite some time.
BAD Although the script lacks nuance or any real tension, Binder uses Costner effectively.
BAD It isn't enough that the movie's heart and soul are in the right place. It needed edge and art to throw a punch.
BAD Not the film America deserves, and it is also not the film America needs. But we got it anyway.
FAIR The script, written by director Binder, tries to say too much, and in doing so, loses some of its charm.
BAD We are left with a movie that raises more questions that it satisfactorily addresses.
FAIR Sorting through prejudices and nuances of racial perception occasionally takes Black or White into intriguing territory...[more often] a rather mushily obvious, TV-movie-style courtroom drama built on straw-man arguments.
BAD A family drama that shies away from any serious examination of racism in America
BAD A movie that means well but lacks the conviction and cultural awareness necessary for anything substantial.
FAIR Great cast reveals rough and sentimental journey; Jillian Estel as Eloise is amazing
BAD Binder's script is a big-screen soap opera, which he attempts to offset with often out-of-place humor.
FAIR Another subtle reminder of how much racial bigotry matters...
FAIR For the first two acts, Mike Binder casts an honest look at these characters' pride and prejudices. Too bad its last act hinges more on incident and surprise than illumination or self-reflection. It mars an otherwise admirably tough-minded drama.
BAD Its heart may be in the right place but the film's script lacks the nuance and subtlety that could really elevate this drama.
FAIR Kevin Costner's and Octavia Spencer's confrontational scenes are "Black or White's" strong suits.
FAIR Oh, the bathos! The loony wrongheadedness of the screenplay!
FAIR It's far from ground-breaking in its social statements, but Black or White is still a solid comedy/drama buoyed by good performances all around.
BAD A discussion is better than none, but the conversation can be improved.
BAD Black Or White asks the right questions, but never gets around to answering them, instead finding itself caught up in stereotypes and cutesy storytelling that often feels like a Hallmark message.
FAIR Black or White is far from perfect, but it's an ideal way to kick off a healthy discussion on race in America.
BAD Even when well-intentioned - which I believe this movie is - broad, sweeping, can't-we-all-just-get-along moralizing only opens the door for cringe-worthy moments, which this movie has plenty of.
FAIR Binder tackles some very tough material here in a very thoughtful way, even if it falls a little off-balance.
BAD Black or White seems manufactured to show why an alcoholic white man is always better than triflin' ass black people.
BAD Kevin Costner scowls and darts around the dubious thin line between "racism" and un-sugarcoated "truthfulness" that only anti-P.C. wingnuts actually believe exists.
FAIR Despite the best of intentions, a career-best performance from Kevin Costner, and outstanding work by Octavia Spencer and child actor Jillian Estell, "Black or White" succumbs to some of the same stereotypes it tries to dispel.
FAIR Black Or White is a good movie constantly fluctuating back and forth from clunky to complex.
FAIR It may be helpful - or vexing - to think of "Black or White" as the great grandchild of "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"
FAIR It's often painful, and not in a good way; it's painful because of the roads it doesn't explore, the shortcuts it takes, and the special pleading it can't stop itself from indulging in.
BAD No one seems to want to talk about [race], so Binder finds ways to force them to. Every time, those methods feel forced and unearned.
FAIR Sometimes flawed material can be saved by great performances and good intentions.
FAIR The film is by no means perfect and its goals are undermined by a sloppy climax and conclusion but it avoids preaching while providing fodder for thought.
BAD Kevin Costner gives everything he's got to the role, but writer-director Mike Binder, who worked beautifully with Costner on 2005's The Upside of Anger, finds himself on the downside of juggling stereotypes.
BAD The title suggests there are no easy answers. So why does everything feel so tidy?
GOOD Epic, intimate and gripping.
FAIR The mountaineers climb for reasons that have little to do with nationalism - reasons the film clumsily attempts to articulate in words. It's far more successful conveying those inspirations with stunning images of them scaling daunting heights.
FAIR It's Kolja Brandt's gloriously edge-of-the-seat/seat-of-the-pants cinematography (much of the film was shot on location) that really packs a natural wallop.
FAIR The images of the Eiger are both majestic and harrowing, and the action is as exciting as in any mountain-climbing movie to date.
GOOD I have no idea if anything beyond the essentials is accurate. A good deal of it feels more like a 1930s movie than a 1930s event
GOOD A straightforward, wickedly suspenseful Man vs. Nature saga of the type that rarely gets made any more.
FAIR Philipp Stolzl worked in the same dangerous conditions as the original climbers, and we can feel the chill and peril in our bones. It's a shame, then, that the screenwriter, unlike the camera crew and the characters, was afflicted with such timidity.
FAIR There's no subtext and not much character development, but those aren't really missed.
FAIR The romantic subplot is underwritten and overwrought. More compelling is ... the impressively harrowing mountain footage.
BAD Some of the plotting (credited to four screenwriters) is too conventional and convenient, and the clunky running time is a problem - two-plus hours of this material is too much.
FAIR With knuckles alternately white from suspense and black from frostbite, the alpinists get progressively harder to tell apart. But the most compelling character, for all its brutal enormity, always was the mountain.
FAIR The word "gripping" doesn't do it justice.
GOOD This white-knuckle adventure is a literal and metaphoric cliff-hanger that gets a spectacular foothold on an unforgiving mountain.
FAIR Some of the shots must have been made on sets. None of that matters. I was on the side of that mountain all the way.
FAIR Most of the action is set on the Eiger's north face, and because this true story is not well known in this country, I was gripped by the very real surprises that occurred there.
FAIR Although about 30 minutes too long, it is still interesting with phenomenal cinematography. It's an exhausting sit, but bring your parka.
FAIR The film puts us on the cruelly beautiful mountain alongside the climbers as they inch up treacherous limestone crags and unstable ice fields. The fear of falling is palpable.
FAIR Five writers were responsible for the script, and the characters consequently have one or two generic characteristics and no inner life of their own; they've been committeed to death.
FAIR You don't have to be a Nazi to be totally mesmerized by the intense drama on the Eiger: the nimble ascent, the calamities that befall our noble climbers, and the pitiable disasters.
FAIR Kolja Brandt's cinematography is stunning, but can't rescue the end from some wince-inducing "Ain't no mountain high enough" heroics.
GOOD Stolzl makes the smallest details loom large.
GOOD Ssuspenseful, meticulously crafted, harrowing and thrilling. It's an incredible true story about courage and the power of the human spirit.
FAIR It is impossible not to put yourself in the boots of the mountaineers clinging to a sheer, icy rock face during a blizzard that threatens to send them into oblivion.
BAD Kolja Brandt's hand-held cinematography and Philipp Stolzl's direction keep the suspense level high. Unfortunately, somebody decided to insert a superfluous love story involving a completely fabricated female photojournalist.
BAD for all the tension-fraught, high-altitude rappelling and cliffhanging, the screenplay has little to counterweigh its commitment to historical truth
FAIR Cleverly playing on the genre's propagandistic ties to the Third Reich, the film reflects the tragic arc of National Socialism in each ominous crevasse and in every grandiloquent gesture.
FAIR Slogs through an hour of frequently rote exposition until it hits its riveting groove when the rappelling and piton-hammering take over.
GOOD A well-crafted, visceral piece of historical filmmaking.
BAD It's the snow-bound scenery that really steals the show.
GOOD Brilliantly shot, utterly convincing footage of young men inching up a vertical rock face proves nerve-racking and a worthy tribute to the true-life bravery of 1930s climbers. It's gripping and fascinating in equal measure.
FAIR Stolzl captures the period idealism and propaganda perfectly. The terrific footage of the climb is an almost unendurably tense watch.
FAIR Stolzl films their harrowing ordeal out on the "Murderwall" with tremendous skill, but the rest of his movie is lumpen to say the least.
BAD Let's hope Richard Gere never has to make another one this cheesy after his comeback in "Arbitrage."
FAIR I may have seen some things coming in the story, but it was nonetheless interesting to watch things play out.
FAIR You have to admire Brandt and Haas for taking such a gamble, but unfortunately it doesn't quite pay off.
FAIR It is a flawed film, but one that accomplishes what it sets out to do: entertain, if in fits and starts, for an hour and a half.
BAD the ineffectiveness of the final half hour ultimately ensures that The Double ends on a disappointingly anticlimactic note.
FAIR The type of professionally assembled star programmer a big studio would once release wide to a decent return in an off-peak season.
BAD With nothing resembling a character worth rooting for, the fact that the plot of The Double just gets sillier and sillier makes it one of the most annoying films of the year.
BAD Brandt's thriller doesn't have much of a connection to the present, let alone reality.
BAD Questionable motives and unbelievable decisions are relatively small potatoes compared with the Sputnik-size plotholes.
BAD Like a stripper who gets naked too quickly, the lukewarm spy thriller "The Double" lays out its big plot twist early in the movie - and soon finds, shivering, that it has nowhere else to go.
FAIR The title "The Double" doesn't refer to baseball, but it could. The thriller may not hit it out of the park, but it's a solid double.
BAD When the story starts to fall apart you're left wondering if the film was worth all the money and effort that went into making it.
BAD It's simply not very good.
BAD Here is a movie constructed from basic parts at the Used Screenplay Store, with a character plugged in whenever one is required.
BAD Generic, formulaic fumble, misjudging its revelations and overestimating their impact.
BAD Not only does The Double's outdated theme feel out of leftfield, it's unexplained and without reason.
BAD It soon devolves into a mess of slit throats and competing motives. Everyone, it seems, has a plot - except the screenwriters.
BAD What can you say about a dull spy thriller that gives away its big "secret'' both in its trailer and the film's title?
BAD If these characters ever had a motivation for their extreme behavior, it disappeared in rewrites.
BAD A tedious, impenetrable cat-and-mouse game involving Russian double and triple agents.
BAD There's a sanded-off, textbook creativity to "The Double" that forsakes rich cloak-and-dagger textures for generic twists, hackneyed flashbacks and telegraphed moments of peril.
BAD Despite similarities, this film is several rungs down the ladder from Salt and lacks the charisma of a lead like Angelina Jolie to pull you past nagging silliness.
BAD Movie packaging at its worst.
BAD ...hopelessly silly.
BAD Like a Training Day for spy thrillers, The Double provocatively pairs Gere and Grace as a gray-green odd couple, only to unravel as the double-crossed absurdities pile up and the duo start trading bad Russian accents in a private Mexican standoff.
BAD Rarely has Mr. Gere walked through any movie with so little energy and so much indifference.
BAD Too silly to be confusing and too flaccid to reach potboiler status, the convoluted spy-thriller The Double is a tossed-off theatrical release that lands with a resounding thud.
BAD I would be amazed to hear even the most ardent Sparks fan defend it as anything more than rubbish.
BAD The Best of Me turns into a half-baked dramatic thriller, with violent confrontations, gunfights, plenty of nasty characters and one big scary action scene.
BAD There's something heavy-handed, even for Sparks, in the telling of the couple's story, particularly when it comes to Dawson's family: they are leering, brutal embodiments of evil who function as handy plot devices.
FAIR A rather typical Nicholas Sparks adaptation...
BAD The Best Of Me, like all Sparks' work, would rather kill his characters and leave a beautiful corpse than have them continue a real, scarred relationship.
BAD Dawson is called a "white trash piece of (poo)" by his own daddy, which is rich, because daddy -- a low-rent bayou criminal with a mean dog on a chain, a shanty tramp on his lap and jet-black dye on his hair -- actually is a white trash piece of (poo).
BAD Welcome the latest Nicholas Sparks adaptation: always the same, always a bit different (but mostly the same).
FAIR You can sneer, but I don't care - the heart wants what it will, and my heart wants Sparks. So there.
BAD Like a hack tunesmith that keeps rewriting the same melodies over and over again, hoping his legion of fans don't notice the ruse, we've heard this Sparks song before.
BAD The film is a huge letdown due to the script. The third act is so much a nonsensical head scratcher that it takes away the alluring romance fans wanted to walk away with.
BAD The Best of Me is quite possibly the worst Nicholas Sparks adaptation ever committed to film.
BAD The worst Nicholas Sparks film of the nine based on his novels, this is the epitome of disingenuous, manufactured and manipulative. The salt on the wound of an already bleeding heart is that the young adults outshine our artificial "A"-list lovebirds.
BAD "I never thought a movie would make me long for the gritty realism of 'The Notebook.'"
BAD Weepy Nicholas Sparks melodrama is cliche-ridden, violent.
FAIR A syrupy, sentimental soap opera tailor-made for fans of the Nicholas Sparks franchise.
BAD It's a very silly film.
BAD Bad boy meets good girl, families get in the way and tragedy follows before the emotionally-contrived ending.
BAD The sunlight is golden, the accent's rural (this one's set in Louisiana), people die, sagacious letters are read aloud.
BAD By the standards of other Sparks productions, this is buoyed up well enough by the cast to float along, and everyone's making the best of a fairly blah job.
BAD At a certain point ... the coincidences and tragic incidents start to pile up at a startling rate and nothing can be taken seriously.
BAD I don't know much about Nicholas Sparks novels but do know movies based on them. They pretty much suck. What makes this one different is sucking at a higher level.
BAD There's a fine line separating a film that puts its own spin on a proven formula and one that becomes a caricature of itself. The Best of Me treads all over that line.
BAD Predictability is The Best of Me's greatest sin. The screenplay might has well have been a game of Mad Libs, where plot devices are lifted straight out of previous Sparks books and shoehorned into this bland narrative.
BAD Cynical and lazy, The Best of Me feels as if it's assembled from parts of other, better weepies.
BAD Interminably long, dragging out its molasses heart through what seem like three different endings.
FAIR The Best of Me isn't too bad for the majority of its time-crossing story, which means the movie is better than the majority of movies based upon Sparks' work.
BAD As the drama unfolds the ludicrousness of J Mills Goodloe and Will Fetters's script intensifies and the dramatic punches are more liable to provoke howls of laughter than tears of sadness.
BAD "The Best of Me" is content to remain a by-the-numbers excursion into tough-to-swallow soap opera theatrics. At this point, even Nicholas Sparks himself should know better.
BAD Like traditional pornography, The Best of Me has no purpose other than to get a specific reaction...
FAIR We've seen this story told in similar fashion so many times in the past. I only wish we could have had it delivered in a fresher, less cliche-filled package.
BAD Much of the dialogue for this terminally mawkish tearjerker sounds as if it has been taken directly from a Dolly Parton or Whitney Houston song.
BAD The latest gaseous emission from the Sparks melodrama machine.
BAD Even permitting that the movie's setup counts almost by default as one of Nicholas Sparks's more complicated scenarios, that makes his failure to draw up compelling, flawed, human characters all the more conspicuous.
BAD Isn't fate a funny thing? Especially when Nicholas Sparks makes it up.
BAD The Best of Me is not the worst adaptation of Nicholas Sparks, but audiences can certainly choose better.
BAD It has a perverse integrity, playing every winsome stare and I'm-gonna-take-my-shirt-off moment with total sincerity.
FAIR the film offers Americans an empathetic glimpse of the country we revolted against all those years ago.
GOOD About more than Bosnia: it's about the immigrant experience; it's about tolerance; it's about making a difference; it's about learning to make the best of what one has.
FAIR People who actually recall 1942 will more greatly appreciate the waves of nostalgia that bathe this affectionate coming-of-age drama, set on a tiny island off New England.
FAIR In the early hijinks phase, the film seems like a dry run for Porky's, but it later gets into the business of fluttering curtains, walks on sandy beaches and longing glances.
GOOD "Summer Of '42" is an unforgettable meditation on sexual awakening and loss during WWII.
FAIR "Summer of '42" is a memory movie, written, directed and acted with such uncommon good humor that I don't think you'll be put off by its sweet soft-focus, at least until you start analyzing it afterwards.
GOOD One of the cinematic coming-of-age stories that started a trend.
FAIR Nostalgic coming-into-manhood fantasy.
FAIR Nostalgia is used as a distancing device -- to keep us safely insulated from the boy's immediate grief, love, and passion.
BAD Dates very badly indeed
FAIR It's apparent in every scene that this is a highly personal film for screenwriter Raucher, and the nostalgia is so palpable that it nearly slides off the screen.
BAD Lacking the faith in God and Hollywood kitsch that motivated Cecil B. DeMille, Ridley Scott's modern-day Bible epic is much less gripping than any movie with plagues of frogs and boils ought to be.
FAIR There's no arguing the immensity of it or the beauty of its visual images. But what's around the many show-stopping moments is too generic to send us out of the theater properly awestruck, reverent and wowed.
BAD I found myself longing for the clarity of Darren Aronofsky's recent Noah, which acknowledged the insane implications of its story by putting rock monsters (fallen angels!) on the screen.
FAIR Exodus: Gods and Kings is by no means a perfect film. But it's a very good film with exceptional devotion to craft, which is more than can be said for many other Bible-themed movies, which often favor accuracy over artistry.
BAD It's a story that has been told and retold for thousands of years, but this po-faced, dutifully spectacular retelling barely lingers in the memory beyond the end credits.
BAD Walk on the bland side in a comic book of biblical proportions.
BAD This sour Moses - whose visions come after a biff on the head - emerges as a certifiable lunatic who gets lucky with a few meteorological, geographical and zoological anomalies.
FAIR Despite the always-commanding Bale as Moses, the emotional side of this story is lacking.
FAIR Ridley Scott's biblical epic "Exodus: Gods and Kings" is by turns fascinating and infuriating, exciting and tedious, head-scratching and inspiring.
BAD Yes, there is spectacle, although the initially promising parting of the Red Sea is almost drowned by waves of climactic silliness.
FAIR The excitement is dampened by a draggy middle where Moses gets married and a tedious epilogue, but Scott's keen ability to explain scripture miracles in credible terms is this biblical blockbuster's major asset.
FAIR Ultimately, it's a determinedly un-ironic biblical epic which may have no time for laughs but shows a keen capacity to tell a decent story well.
BAD The assortment of four credited writers charged with getting Exodus whipped into shape did an alarmingly terrible job of it.
BAD It's sad to say that the most interesting aspects of this film don't actually occur on the screen.
FAIR From a visual perspective, Scott has created a picture that, at times, can take your breath away, but he loses sight of the more intimate, idiosyncratic elements that should elevate and humanise this narrative.
FAIR In a world still being torn apart by religious conflict, the film does have a resonance beyond the grand visual sweep that Scott can always be relied upon to deliver.
BAD Just another disappointingly so-so Scott production - more Kingdom of Heaven than Gladiator.
FAIR Exodus feels like a missed opportunity.
GOOD Trust Ridley Scott to give us a bold, revisionist take on the foundation story of three major world religions.
FAIR Whether it's Ramses losing half his army in a horrific landslide or vast, sweeping panoramas of the Pharaoh's Egypt in all its blood-built glory, Exodus is an entertainment of the first order.
BAD the film's racial issues only make it seem that much leaden, unimaginative, and old-fashioned
FAIR Scott once seemed divine. Look on [Exodus], ye mighty, and despair.
FAIR Aside from impressive 21st century digital effects, this new take on the Moses story pales in comparison to Cecil B. DeMille's iconic 1956 version, The Ten Commandments, which is far more resonant and intensely dramatic.
FAIR It's in the spectacle elements that Scott's film thrives, and of his recent big-budget mediocrities, Exodus is probably the best.
BAD How do you screw up the parting of the Red Sea? How does Ridley Scott?
BAD Production Stands Tall, Story Washed Out
BAD Exodus frequently feels like it is running down a checklist of scenes and events rather than telling a natural story.
BAD The film's emotional component hinges on Moses leaving his wife and young son for a long and dangerous journey. But what you'll remember best is all the smiting.
BAD His direction snaps to life in the big moments, which have an energy and drive missing from the rest of the movie.
BAD Even Christian Bale's noteworthy performance can't save the fact that Exodus: Gods and Kings never finds a proper pace thanks to its offbeat storytelling.
GOOD 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' is spectacular.
FAIR Ridley Scott only barely manages to pull this off by playing the spectacle card with 'Exodus: Gods and Kings.'
BAD Galifianakis [is] able to turn on a dime; balancing his disarming humour with moments of anguished outbreaks. His is one of the best supporting performances of recent memory; equally funny and heartbreaking. If only I could say the same of the movie.
FAIR For all its problems, though, the film is easy-going, frequently channels into a sweet-natured tone and is able to raise a few chuckles.
BAD It may not be One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but it's also not Patch Adams.
BAD It's also a kind of two-dimensional romance, a kind of flippant look at life on a mental ward, and (...) kind of made me want to give Zach Galifianakis a hug.
FAIR It's Kind of a Funny Story lacks substance, but after you've spent a short time in this ward, you have to agree with Craig: These crazies aren't so bad.
FAIR Wavering between affecting dramedy and goofy asylum- com, this is an enjoyable but superficial placebo that soft-soaps the realities of psychological disorder.
BAD [A] flimsy, box-ticking quirk fest.
BAD As a self-help sitcom, it feels both glib and icky. Glicky?
BAD In the end, like the instantly-forgettable title, it's kind of neither one thing nor the other and certainly no match for the likes of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or even Girl, Interrupted.
BAD No it's not. It's kind of a rubbish story.
BAD As disposable as a paper cup and, for such promising directors, a serious regression.
GOOD It's a fine teen film - and how often do you see those words in the same sentence?
FAIR A pleasant movie, but no more.
BAD It kind of isn't.
GOOD In the end, the title of the film contains an irony that may be lost on the filmmakers: this is kind of a funny story, no more, no less.
BAD Has a genuine understanding of the protagonist, but ends up betraying him.
FAIR It's a neat comedy without being a neat and tidy comedy.
FAIR The journey is aided immeasurably by the casting of Keir Gilchrist as young Craig. He has dark, sensitive eyes and a probity about him that wins you to his side.
GOOD Here is the most uplifting, quirky film I've seen in a long time. It brought me joy.
FAIR Writing and directing partners Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have come up with a smart little film, a gentle drama with both an embraceable tone and a refreshing optimism.
FAIR Even though the film is somewhat mopey, it's also packed with great moments.
FAIR kind of funny, kind of touching, kind of moving, kind of odd, kind of quirky, and kind of lots of other thing, but, it's never fully anything
BAD The people most out of touch with reality are not those onscreen, but the people behind the camera who think this film is a reflection of coping with depression.
FAIR Enjoyable comedy/drama with an engaging script, appealing characters, a superb soundtrack and terrific central performances from Keir Gilchrist and Zach Galifianakis.
BAD The title of 'best movie ever set in a mental hospital' remains firmly secure with 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'
GOOD ...sort of upper-middle class Precious, an emo flick for self-indulgent white kids who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf.
FAIR Low-key adolescent angst, marred by the type of brief fantasy shots and sequences (the characters as rock stars, lip-synching 'Under Pressure') that have become a let's-go-for-an-easy-laugh crutch for filmmakers.
FAIR Zach G.is the next Bill Murray.
FAIR It's a less anguished, much funnier 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'...
FAIR ...able to honestly juggle mental illness and a sense of hope.
GOOD A rich and unusual film that really defies categorization.
FAIR The writing-directing team of Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden have created a solid mix of serious, darker scenes and flights of fancy.
FAIR The acting is strong, with Galifianakis doing an especially good job as the likeable Bobby.
FAIR Is that the best approach to take about a subject as heady as mental illness, especially at a time when there are more kids on Zoloft than Flintstones? chewables?
BAD Where?s Nurse Ratched when you really need her?
FAIR Call it "Cuckoo Light" with a PG 13-appropriate amount of angst and just enough laughs and creativity to keep your attention.
FAIR It?s no "One Flew Over the Cuckoo?s Nest," but this little dramedy about life in a Brooklyn psych ward has its small charms.
FAIR Contrived though the situation may sound, Akers orchestrates it with style
FAIR A rollicking paean to the musical that owes as much to Hollywood as it does to Bollywood.
GOOD Wristcutters: A Love Story is like a suicidal Wizard of Oz.
BAD It is a staggeringly awful road movie, not much enlivened by the presence of Tom Waits as a wizened participant.
FAIR The purgatorial premise is pleasingly eccentric but, in the end, Wristcutters falls victim to its washed-out mood, and limps bloodlessly to a close.
BAD A dreary, self-consciously quirky indie flick that seems to go on forever, despite an economical running time.
BAD Veering from witty to occasionally trite, Wristcutters: A Love Story has plenty of originality on its side, but never manages to be more than the sum of its self-consciously quirky parts.
FAIR A little self-consciously kooky but with an ace soundtrack that combines gypsy punksters Gogol Bordello with real-life plug-pullers this sure beats putting your head in the oven.
FAIR Dark subject matter, but Goran Dukic's film is whimsical and determinedly optimistic about life.
FAIR For the better part of the journey this a bizarrely uplifting yarn - razor sharp, you might say.
BAD Opportunities to comment on the ethical grey areas of suicide are mostly squandered and, as the pointless digressions begin to pile up, your mind begins to drift from the action on screen.
GOOD Enjoyably quirky black comedy that's clearly destined to become a cult movie amongst the Gothic contingent.
FAIR Despite being occasionally hilarious, director Goran Dukic should have toned down the wackiness.
BAD Another indie director more interested in style than substance.
BAD If you're going to make a comedy about suicide, you'd better make sure the jokes land. There are people out there who could use a laugh.
FAIR It has 'midnight movie' written all over it.
FAIR Wristcutters is a small film of ambitions nicely scaled to the performances and story. Who knew that affectless characters could be so oddly affecting?
FAIR Wristcutters opens with what proves to be its best scene, one that could stand alone as a brilliant short subject.
GOOD The vision of life after death varies between the religious and the non-religious, the optimists and the pessimists and the believers and non-believers. There are few after-life stories, though, as unique and humorous as this.
FAIR All this sounds rather grim, and indeed it is -- but this backward Heaven Can Wait is also, thanks to [director] Dukic's inventive imagination, surprisingly involving and ultimately sweet.
FAIR Wristcutters is a cut above most low-budget American indies, with something original to say about the human condition and an artful way of saying it.
BAD Goran Dukic's film starts off seeming hip and funky and dark, but almost immediately runs out of steam. It feels like a short carelessly padded to feature length.
BAD The future of Wristcutters as a cult favorite is less assured. Rather than benefiting from repeated viewings, the movie's charm is pretty much spent after the first half hour.
FAIR We witness the birth of a new genre, the Post-Slasher Movie.
FAIR Croatian filmmaker Goran Dukic's debut feature turns out to be a sweetly grim lark: a road film through Limbo.
FAIR ...more whimsical and charming than you would ever expect from a picture about suicide.
FAIR Though it goes a bit wonky toward the end and seems to travel a very long way to drive home a rather simple point, Wristcutters: A Love Story remains a wonderfully evocative experience.
BAD Almost 40 years ago Easy Rider established that road trips can make great independent films. Or at least cheap ones. But when booking a room inside the pearly gates, cheap may not be exactly what you're looking for.
BAD Screenwriter/director Goran Dukic can't quite decide on a tone. The film is at times lighthearted, almost effervescent, and then it's so dark that it becomes depressingly bleak.
FAIR Wristcutters is quite a bit darker than most mainstream romantic comedies. As you might not expect, it's also quite a bit more inventive and far wittier than most mainstream romantic comedies.
GOOD Goran Dukic, working from a short story by Etgar Kiret, has fashioned a life-after-death that is both somber and silly.
BAD The witless Wristcutters holds all the fascination of a train wreck. Youa(TM)ll stay in your seat just to see if ita(TM)ll get any worse, and you wona(TM)t be disappointed.
BAD Immature ideas amateurishly executed ...
FAIR The mumblecore dialogue can be annoying, but along with the excellent score, it actually serves this tense haziness well.
FAIR A slow but sure essay on the strengths and weaknesses of love and possession.
FAIR Takal has a gift for dialogue and for character, the latter especially strong when it comes to Genevieve.
BAD As the narrative lugubriously sticks to the documented events, we are served nothing more than a filmed transcript.
BAD It's well-constructed and acted, but mainly just left me feeling like I needed a shower after an exercise in voyeurism surrounding an event that's still hard to watch.
BAD Even if you can forgive [director] Piddington's mangling of the basics, you will find it hard to overlook his frantic use of slo-mo, a wobbly camera, freeze frames, double exposures and a close-up of a single eye.
FAIR Though the psychic space Piddington and Ball create is certainly a terrifyingly claustrophobic place to be, it's also stultifying and banal in the way other people's crazed obsessions become after a very short while.
BAD The only revelations in The Killing of John Lennon are those we could have picked up ourselves, assuming we cared enough to do so.
FAIR Only slightly better than Chapter 27, it's questionable whether even the most morbidly curious John Lennon fan might have any interest in sitting through nearly two hours of this creepy lunatic.
FAIR Piddington does a beautiful balancing act, creating a movie that works both on the level of suspense and as a detailed factual chronicle.
FAIR Andrew Piddington's devastating re-enactment of events leading up to, including and immediately after the murder is taken from interviews, depositions and court transcripts.
BAD Piddington never dares to diagnose Chapman's rage, settling for Wikipedia-style objectivity dressed in the more fatuous-than-provocative manner of Robinson Devor's Zoo.
BAD Charting Chapman's relationship with The Catcher in the Rye to being quizzed after the murder, this is an engrossing study - but paper thin.
BAD It features actor Jonas Ball looking more or less like the famed police mugshot, lumbering about with Chapman's own interminable (but avowedly authentic) prison-diary ramblings recited in voiceover.
BAD The makers of this tasteless and generally bleak recreation of Chapman's life in the three months before the killing just didn't get it. The man who shot the ex-Beatle deserves to rot unforgotten in his six by ten, not have films made about him.
FAIR There's a feeling of eerie otherworldliness and the murder itself is relished in detail, however the film does lack overall impact
BAD Chapman was on a simple, skewed quest for infamy. And he got it. One gathers he'd be chuffed to see this film. And that's the biggest issue of all.
GOOD Unlike shabby exploitation docu-dramas such as Bundy, this is an honest meditation on the warped assassin and his motives and assumes the tension of a thriller as the appointed time approaches.
GOOD A transfixing recreation of the events that shocked the world.
BAD Tense until the murder, but Piddington assumes we all care as much about Chapman as he does.
GOOD Piddington has pulled off a delicate balancing act, presenting Chapman as an explosive by-product of our celebrity-obsessed times, while resisting the temptation to validate Chapman's own elaborate self-mythologising.
FAIR not mean to be taken seriously
BAD [The characters] aren't people; they're mere objects to stick in front of the flowing lava.
BAD Movie bombs L.A. with lava, audience with stupidity
BAD The special effects are impressive and the acting by Jones and Heche is good, although their roles didn't require much skill or inspiration.
FAIR The film, about a volcano erupting in downtown Los Angeles, is helped immeasurably by veteran actor Tommy Lee Jones, who has enough charm and charisma to rescue just about any movie. He needs it all to save this one.
FAIR On its own escapist terms, Volcano dishes up a textbook serving of low-I.Q., high-energy entertainment.
FAIR The action, the effects and tough-as-nails Tommy Lee provide a worthwhile thrill ride -- even if the last drop wasn't as big as you thought it would be.
FAIR gives us the bare minimums needed for a story and then lets the lava flow
FAIR The coast may be toast, but it's the lava, covering everything like a malevolent tide of melted butter, that makes this a disaster picture that's tastier than usual.
BAD There's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone.
BAD I don't want to pay $7.50 to watch a movie imitate CNN.
BAD Oh, there's nothing like a natural disaster to bring people together!
BAD Hundreds of screen technicians obviously slaved on the effects -- and for what? A dopey subplot about a bogus arrest. Soap opera involving Jones' injured daughter.
BAD Volcano is an embarrassment, albeit one of the so-bad-it's-kinda-good variety.
GOOD These things can be done well or badly, and Volcano goes full steam ahead.
FAIR More about spectacle than suspense, a very impressive production which is easier to enjoy from a detached distance than it is to get caught up in.
BAD Like the substantially better Twister, this film insists on a thunderous, exhausting pace that inevitably becomes deflating.
BAD Volcano is an absolutely standard, assembly-line undertaking; no wonder one of the extras is reading a paperback titled "Screenwriting Made Easy."
BAD A ridiculous script and mediocre special effects mar this ludicrous disaster pic.
FAIR Memorable? Hardly, but the main actors are worth seeing, and that first act has so much promise it almost makes you want to forgive them for blowing the second.
FAIR This is one of the best pure disaster movies ever made (not that it has much competition). Congratulations to director Mick Jackson for a job well done.
BAD A host of characters is introduced in the opening scenes, but Volcano doesn't know what to do with them. It can't make us care.
FAIR The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest doesn't exactly give the Millennium trilogy the explosive send-off it deserves, and stacked against the other two movies in the series, it's perhaps the weakest story of the three.
GOOD This film ends up being more of a courtroom drama, and yet it's almost as equally thrilling as the first film in the series.
FAIR Unlike its two predecessors, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest boasts a briskly-paced opening half hour that proves effective at immediately drawing the viewer into the movie...
FAIR For me the most deadening aspect of these films is the presence of Michael Nykvist as Blomqvist; he seems to have a personality by-pass, and remains expressionless at all times, no matter what's going on.
BAD The best thing that can be said about the excruciatingly dull, badly made closing chapter in this punishingly bad Swedish crime trilogy is that it really whets the appetite for the upcoming American version.
GOOD Seeing the first two films -- The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played with Fire -- will make the third film more satisfying.
BAD Lisbeth Salander, played by Noomi Rapace, spends most of the story constrained -- first in the hospital, then in prison. What fun is that?
BAD The third and final entry in Stieg Larsson's enormously successful series is perhaps the least thrilling, but it's easily the most satisfying.
GOOD Finale of dark subtitled Swedish trilogy still very violent.
FAIR Semi-satisfying, if you can keep up.
GOOD The gap between this and Dragon Tattoo is pretty big -- this won't be on my '10 Best' list and Tattoo might -- but as the rest of the story, it does nicely.
FAIR While the events are fascinating and entertaining, the film itself is less emotionally involving or viscerally thrilling.
BAD Much of it still plays like bad Thomas Harris...
GOOD A pick-up after the second film, if not as assured as the first. Rapace sets a high watermark for Rooney Mara in David Fincher's remakes.
BAD One final course of Europudding that may leave audiences feeling less satisfied than simply tired and bloated.
BAD A more apt title would be 'The Girl Who Sat Quietly in a Dimly Lit Room'.
BAD This is the most disappointing end to a trilogy since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3.
FAIR Anyone who has invested in the trilogy will savour the mixture of dread and anticipation as the cat-and-mouse game reaches a stirring conclusion.
BAD A bunch of evil old men get their comeuppance in 'The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,' but the girl who messes with their nest does hardly anything at all.
BAD The third and worst of Stieg Larsson's trilogy is poorly directed, under-energised and unthrilling.
GOOD A compelling mix of 70s-style conspiracy thriller, courtroom procedural and psychological drama...
GOOD The powerful performances by the leads, unobtrusive direction that is exemplified in a beguiling courtroom clash, and Larsson's deftly interwoven fabric of treachery and compassion all ensure that we are left yearning for more.
BAD As well as being conventional, The Girl Who Kicked is also confusing, dull and grubby (do we really need to see examples from a child-porn site?).
BAD Is the Millennium Trilogy over? Can we go home?
BAD The Girl Who Makes Us Wish We Were Anywhere Else.
FAIR The final film based on Stieg Larsson's bestselling thriller trilogy opens with a whimper but ends with a bang.
GOOD As ever, Rapace steals every scene she's in, maintaining Lisbeth's moody enigma whether she's lying on her sick bed, making a memorable court entrance in full punk regalia, or taking care of family business.
FAIR This remains watchable thanks to Nyqvist and Rapace but the lacklustre direction, lack of pace and bloated script ensure that it's closer to the mediocre nature of the second film than the brilliance of the first.
GOOD ...could be read as the passion of Lisbeth Salander, as she undergoes a kind of secular crucifixion at the hands of the Swedish establishment ...
FAIR It's enough to see Rapace's Salander smile, however tentatively, however briefly, however unlikely. Those white teeth framed by black-on-black everything? They bite.
FAIR The series is quite satisfying as a whole, in the manner of the type of well-made, limited-episode crime program that might appear on AMC or HBO.
BAD The Matrix: Revolutions of the Millennium Trilogy.
BAD While Rapace remains a strong and captivating actress in the title role, the film is remarkably bad. In fact, it's easily one of the year's worst movies. Boring beyond belief.
BAD The Millennium Trilogy follows a similar pattern as The Matrix Trilogy, and that's not a compliment.
FAIR The European equivalent of The Matrix Revolutions, this third chapter finds a once-vibrant saga largely coasting on the fumes of its well-regarded predecessors.
BAD When your series' most compelling character remains mute and largely on the periphery of the action (albeit all decked out in punker regalia, including a big Mohawk), something is seriously amiss.
FAIR This 148-minute movie is best appreciated if you have already watched the first two movies or read the books. It is not intended to be a standalone film. Neophytes will find themselves lost and confused without sufficient background to fully appreciate...
BAD Cute but uneven. Best for dog lovers.
FAIR If you've followed the previous Shiloh films, then you'll be satisfied, if not overjoyed, by this final chapter.
BAD If you are new to the series, I would suggest your starting with the original Shiloh, so far, the best in show.
BAD Offers exactly what you've come to expect from the series: Bland but wholly innocuous family entertainment featuring a cute kid and an even cuter dog.
FAIR Wilson ... makes this film, via grit of detail, a bit more than a Hallmark Special Retro Disney Walton sermon in values.
BAD Boring as porridge.
BAD An OK kids movie passing through on the way to video.
BAD You won't find the pragmatic intelligence of Naylor's original stories here, but even cynics may be touched by the film's remarkably wholesome lessons about friendship, family and forgiveness.
GOOD It's a family film that deals with real problems and teaches real values, and yet is exciting and entertaining.
BAD If Sandy Tung's film had flavor, it might taste like a week-old bagel.
FAIR Saving Shiloh is touching, intelligent and admirably thoughtful.
BAD ... has more respect for the intelligence of the title dog than its audience.
BAD Two major issues here: The boy, Marty (Jason Dolley), is a patronizing do-gooder, and the dog, a beagle-looking fella, doesn't do much that's special.
GOOD An absorbing insight into the life of one of the industry's mot renowned, and elusive stars.
BAD There are some pleasing touches, but this film is a frustrating experience.
GOOD The pre-noir gangster genre was in many ways defined by the innovative approaches taken by Hawks in this film.
GOOD The greatest gangster movie of the 1930s -- and that means the greatest ever.
GOOD [The police chief] endorses the myth of the west while conceiving the urban gangster as a rat-like menace.
GOOD Completely relevant: Citizens complain that access to technologically more efficient guns is partly to blame for the crime wave; they fret over illegal immigrants; they worry that the 'new breed' of criminal is more uncivilized than its predecessor...
GOOD Atmospheric, mesmerising and darkly humourous with a sizzling script and cast. This is a true classic of its genre.
GOOD Paul Muni goes way over the top as Tony Camonte, painting a picture of a gangster who knows nothing but excess, and who will stop at nothing to get his way.
GOOD The slaughter in Scarface, the Shame of a Nation, the Howard Hughes gangster production... is like that of a Shakespearean tragedy
GOOD Hawks displays balls of steel, using the filmic medium to challenge the free reign of mobsters in the 1930's.
GOOD The quintessential crime thriller. One of the few perfect films.
GOOD The quintessential classic gangster picture.
GOOD a potent, uncompromising and de-romanticized portrait of the gangster life
GOOD Scarface is unquestionably one of the greatest talking American movies ever made, and has been terribly underrated all through this century.
GOOD One of Hawks's undisputed masterpieces, and a landmark in the screen depiction of gangsters.
GOOD Convoluted but absorbing.
GOOD A thoroughly enjoyable murder mystery in the classic style.
GOOD Superb production with memorable Sinise performance in title role.
GOOD An excellent biopic anchored by a marvelous job by Sinise.
FAIR Its Cliffs Notes approach to the source biography gets a big boost from star Gary Sinise.
GOOD Cynical and raunchy comedy for adults only.
BAD Unfortunately, the tender observations Zwigoff and Clowes specialize in are largely missing from Art School Confidential, which spends its energy on the zany people who'd usually pepper the edges of their films.
BAD It's too crass to be a plausible satire, and not funny enough to be a dumb comedy.
GOOD It's the work of two misanthropes in an even worse mood than usual.
GOOD An ingenious satire of the pretentious mindset of the elitist art world from the perspective of a rapidly-disillusioned kid who had no idea what he was getting into.
FAIR ...generally comes off as nothing less than a substantial disappointment.
BAD The few characters we might have cared for become increasingly shallow, and it all lapses into cliches about the relationship between art and infamy, between personal integrity and selling your soul, and so on.
BAD The true merit of the movie is the momentary pleasures of the dialogue and the performances, but the story itself leaves you wanting. So, is it art? Looks like it.
BAD Has the makings of a mediocre, after-school sitcom
FAIR Art School Confidential s'avere une autre belle reussite pour les deux artistes [Zwigoff et Clowes] qui, esperons-le, collaboreront a nouveau dans un avenir rapproche.
FAIR This smarty-pants campus yarn is on fire with satire.
FAIR Director Terry Zwigoff and comic book artist-turned-screenwriter Daniel Clowes follow up their Ghost World success with a less satisfying collaboration.
FAIR Ita(TM)s fine that this film feels uncomfortable indulging the shopworn tropes of coming-of-age story or black comedy or romance or mystery thriller, but, well, ambivalence is self-propagating.
BAD Rather than observing the intimate details that make an Art School project special, the filmmakers opt to focus on Art School partying (i.e., drinking and vomiting) instead.
FAIR Well-meaning, but ultimately flawed.
BAD This has the feel of a beginner's film and has some fun moments and a good performance by John Malkovich, but overall does not have enough to keep it going.
GOOD Zygoff and Clowes do get the most out of their first-rate cast and prove that hollow laughs are far superior to no laughs at all.
BAD In almost any medium, Art School Confidential would draw a failing grade.
FAIR It's a sardonic, subversive, heavy-handed black comedy, painting a nasty picture.
GOOD Bitter, flawed, a bit sophomoric, but compelling in a way that better balanced cinematic efforts rarely are.
FAIR ...a sort of John Hughes revamp of Fritz Lang's 'Scarlet Street' (another film in which sexual desire leads a struggling painter down a path of death and stolen artistic identity).
FAIR ...if the lack of chemistry between the leads and the glued-together nature of the plot bring the movie down, they don't totally extinguish its subversive spirit.
BAD "Art School Confidential," compared to Zwigoff's other masterpieces "Ghost World" and "Crumb," is a paint-by-numbers picture.
BAD If you're an art student, you'll probably buy the movie on DVD and rub it all over your body.
GOOD Their humor comes not from a need to be loved or a need to win awards, but rather straight from an acute awareness of the world's follies.
FAIR No matter which is the real imitator, life or art, Art School Confidential does its own fine job skewering both.
BAD The film loses its way with multiple subplots, becoming a hodgepodge that isn't particularly hard to follow, but, far worse, provides no compelling reason to bother.
BAD The movie has no supportive theme or rhythm, nothing to bind its dotty patches together.
BAD This tale of a naive young student who is thrown to the arrogant wolves at an art school comes off as both insecure and insincere. I often didn't believe it, and I wasn't sure the creators really believed it either.
BAD A movie with the odd, tired joke about art and artists, a college romance that isn't romantic, and a plot twist that doesn't twist at all.
BAD It feels deflated, disgruntled and pathetic.
BAD The film is so busy working hard to convict one rather shady character, it never convinces us of its own reason to exist.
BAD The acting occasionally borders on great. The story itself is more than worthy. But none of that comes close to overcoming the misguided pacing and overall lack of depth.
FAIR A somewhat flawed yet ultimately satisfying thriller.
BAD A story that's overloaded with research and unbridled speculation, all told with no clear direction.
FAIR The end result is intriguing, with a dash of a love story here and a twisty whodunit there. A fine performance by Ryan Gosling glues the mishmash together.
FAIR All Good Things isn't a pleasurable film to experience, but it offers an uncanny evocation of a narcissistic sociopath who doesn't come at us with the charm and sophistication that the typical screen bad guy has.
FAIR All Good Things is a crackerjack crime thriller.
BAD Ryan Gosling is sadly miscast as the villain in this poorly-written drama.
FAIR Jarecki never settles on what kind of story he wants to tell with these elements, and despite good performances, "All Good Things" veers awkwardly from love story to tragedy, from true-life mystery to black comedy.
BAD There's a fascinating story here for a bolder filmmaker, but after so much meandering it's a relief that All Good Things must come to an end.
FAIR One can't help but think that veteran documentarian Jarecki chose to rework this material as drama to benefit his career, not the story. The result is a disjointed art film that opts for ambiguity over clarity...
BAD Jarecki knows how to make scenes of boisterous family reunions and quiet moments between lovers engaging: He fares less well, though, when the story takes a dark turn.
GOOD ...a movie suspended between bold novelistic invention and journalistic reserve. Be it demerit or credit, Jarecki is no Truman Capote and All Good Things is no In Cold Blood.
FAIR Dunst shines brightly and puts on an acting showcase worthy of awards recognition in the supporting actress category. The picture loses its luster when her character disappears.
FAIR All Good Things is curiously underwhelming.
FAIR While the acting is superb and the film worth viewing, in this odd straddle between fact and fiction, the filmmakers miss the chance to bring more fictive power to the tale.
BAD a rather meticulously-detailed period piece that fails almost completely to offer up any human interest in its pursuit of human truth.
FAIR It also feels like one man's attempt to try another in the court of cinema, or perhaps correct the course of justice itself.
BAD Beset with a series of miscalculated dramatic misfires, the film is a melodramatic adaptation of a tabloid-style 20/20 murder-mystery, wearyingly overstuffed with baroque detail in an effort to prop up its legitimacy.
FAIR In his first fictional feature, [Jarecki ] can't decide whether to opt for the open-ended inquiry of a non-fiction film or the resolved storytelling of Hollywood genre movie, so he winds up stranded in between.
FAIR The second half is at once unconventional and straightforward -- the former because of the actual content, the latter in terms of structure in which it's presented.
BAD Gosling and co-stars Kirsten Dunst and Frank Langella don't do anything wrong here but the movie is such a mash-up of tones, fiction, and reality that it never comes together into anything coherent.
GOOD Kirsten Dunst is so good here as a woman at a loss to understand who her husband really is, and what the true nature of his family involves.
FAIR Too bad it's not a doc, which might have revealed the secrecy and confusion that led to such a legendary case remaining unsolved.
BAD You never feel you can trust that Jarecki knows what he's doing, which becomes even more problematic when the movie asks us to believe its theory about an unsolved crime.
FAIR "All Good Things" has the eerie power of a nightmare.
FAIR As excellent as Gosling is - and the actor conveys the stillness of the man as well as the voices screaming in his head - Dunst matches him stride for stride.
FAIR It's a strange, thrilling tale begrimed by bad memories, by bad deeds.
BAD full review at Movies for the Masses
BAD Dunst is not the only person doing quality work in "All Good Things," but she is the only one worth watching.
FAIR You watch it wanting to scurry off to read accounts of the real thing, rather than being caught up in the filmmaking.
FAIR beneath the surface are all kinds of questions about power and wealth and the cyclical nature of familial tragedy, and while they break through from time to time, it is never enough to give the film more depth than a TrueTV documentary
FAIR Fascinating study of criminal justice in the crumbling Nazi empire of 1944.
BAD It crouches but -- alas -- never springs.
FAIR ...unabashed fantasy...
GOOD I LOVE this movie. Bad sequels take away from the original.
FAIR Surprisingly not-awful cable-flick action-fest!
FAIR Whatever the political undercurrent at work, every so often you have to remind yourself that this happened to four young men, no doubt the brightest stars of loving families.
GOOD Peter Berg is effectively offering four Rambos for the price of one - the Seals' bullet-whistling gunfight scenes are a combination of Saving Private Ryan on a ridge, Heat on a hill and Open Range out in the open. Bang, bang, bang! And bang again!
BAD Lone Survivor comes off as a celebration of the martyred American soldier, that myth that makes it that much easier for old men to send young men to their deaths.
FAIR Knowing the outcome tends to lessen the intensity of the well-shot action sequences.
FAIR Encontra seus melhores momentos em suas sequencias de acao.
FAIR Lone Survivor is a proficiently-made film with plenty to enjoy, but truly embracing it is difficult outside of an American context.
FAIR Lone Survivor is a proficiently-made film with plenty to enjoy, but truly embracing it is difficult outside of an American context.
FAIR The most harrowing combat film since Saving Private Ryan.
FAIR Small in scale but just as intense, Lone Survivor's extended battle recalls the opening of Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. like its hardy protagonists, is determined to get the job done.
GOOD If there's one major message at the core of Peter Berg's outstanding, realistic, fact-based war film it's that no amount of new-fangled military technology can take away from the brutality and human cost of frontline fighting.
GOOD If Mark Wahlberg stars as an interesting character, the movie has a fighting chance at the box office - and this one became a hit.
FAIR It will be remembered for its bone-breaking, blood-splattering, white-knuckle skirmish - not for its performances, characters, plot or dialogue. On this level, it works.
FAIR For all its flaws it is both a gripping action thriller and an unforgettable depiction of the cold realities of war. My first reaction after seeing it was a simple one: this must be how it was. It may be the highest tribute I can pay.
BAD ...a disappointing, underwhelming actioner from Peter Berg...
FAIR A portrayal of strict military excellence and grueling physical performances, to which Mark Wahlberg brings his best game.
GOOD Captures the raw intensity of combat and carnage on both sides of the battlefront, and the heroics that forge an indelible spirit in combat
FAIR Lone Survivor sticks pretty closely to the facts, has real momentum and a series of impressive action sequences
FAIR While the violence is horrifying, the encasing narrative is perversely "heroic", with corn-fed dialogue presented as solidly non-ironic, and images of the real-life combatants used to stirring, manipulative ends.
FAIR An occasionally smart script - and four excellent actors - keep the project grounded.
GOOD Lone Survivor does a magnificent job of making disorder intelligible. It's not a very nice film. But it is a splendidly effective one.
GOOD Lone Survivor does a magnificent job of making disorder intelligible. It's not a very nice film. But it is a splendidly effective one.
BAD The relentless intensity quickly grows numbing.
BAD Replete with a certain kind of self-importance and self-forgiveness, this Afghan war movie starring Mark Wahlberg has a distinctively martyred America-at-bay feel.
GOOD There are nuggets of honesty amid the gung-ho jingoism in Peter Berg's starry-eyed war story.
GOOD The picture may not be in contention for Oscars but it's a first-class modern war film: visceral, exciting and thought-provoking.
FAIR The film alternates between the pulverisingly immediate and dismayingly generic.
FAIR [The second act] is the core of the film, and it works very well. What falls on either side has been designed to support it, but comes close to achieving the opposite.
BAD Lone Survivor is well made and well acted but its refusal to pass comment on the central mission means that it ultimately feels like a gung ho fantasy that lacks emotional impact.
GOOD Luttrell's remarkable story of survival is worth telling. Inevitably, the temptation to depict US military as consummate heroes creeps through. Yet it's a more balanced account than you might expect.
FAIR nothing if not a deeply felt paean to the characters' toughness, bravery, and, most importantly, humanity
GOOD Berg reconstructs the gunfight brilliantly. Superb stunts, a dizzying use of handheld cameras, great editing and brilliant acting combine to make this the most intense war movie since Black Hawk Down.
FAIR Lone Survivor isn't always sophisticated ... But there's moral complexity and a climax in an Afghan village which is tense and surprisingly moving.
FAIR A severe portrait of fortitude under extreme pressure, somewhat marred by blinkered politics.
FAIR Mark Wahlberg stands firm as Luttrell and he also produced this version of events which, ultimately, celebrates the brotherhood of soldiers and hits hard, on a gut level.
FAIR The direction pummels and the cast impress, yet Berg's war movie promises more than it delivers.
FAIR A noble, moving tribute.
FAIR Lone Survivor' hits home and hits hard.
FAIR The film shows us the landscape of modern warfare, which when it is men with guns facing each other is pretty much the way war has been in the trenches since the Civil War.
GOOD Untethered to any post-TV era is a conclusion that America gets too comfortable with the mental inactivity it enables. Edward R. Murrow's titular signoff begins as a trademark and ends as a challenge to a medium - one too often unmet today.
GOOD Provocative, principled and richly detailed, this is compelling stuff. Emotionally ita(TM)s a little dry, but as brain-food, ita(TM)s absolutely invigorating. George done good.
GOOD Scrupulously journalistic, sometimes to its credit, sometimes to its deficit as a movie.
GOOD Good Night is not your average historical recreation. It doesn't dumb-down its story or its characters with needless explanation for the benefit of an under-educated audience.
GOOD proves that it is still possible in the cinema, if not in television, to inform without being boring and entertain without condescending.
BAD bez obzira na plemenite namjere svojih tvoraca, ipak ne zaslu%u017Euje "Oscara", jer je iznevjerio visoke standarde objektivnosti koje pripisuje svom junaku.
GOOD ... a timely reminder of the consequences of failing to balance national security with personal liberties... (believability is) what really comes through on the screen...
GOOD David Strathairn is terrific and with George Clooney's passion for his subject, they make [i]Good Night[/i] a satisfying comparison between the past and the present.
GOOD Many will see it as a cautionary tale: Don't let anyone else do your thinking for you. The truth is the thing. Cherish it and defend it.
FAIR more interested using the movie medium as a pulpit from which to pontificate...political beliefs rather than in telling a dramatically engaging story
FAIR Strathairn's performance is uncanny, and the 1950s period detail is spot-on.
GOOD Today, history records Edward R. Murrow as a towering journalist and Senator McCarthy as a sniveling tyrant. Don't you love it when history gets it right.
GOOD One of this year's most powerful films.
FAIR It is all outstandingly performed and photographed.
GOOD George Clooney is emerging as one of America's bravest, boldest filmmakers. And with this highly-charged political thriller, he's also emerging as one of its very best.
FAIR If you enjoy that sort of thing, this one makes its points, short and sweet, and looks good, while doing so.
FAIR Un valioso testimonio sobre una epoca controversial (con inquietantes referencias a la actual politica de Estados Unidos), filmado en extraordinario blanco y negro y con estupenda labor de David Strathairn.
FAIR A clever, quietly spoken little movie and a great pleasure to watch.
FAIR An admirable film; it tells an important story, and it's stoked with obvious conviction.
GOOD Methodically and purposefully demonstrates the importance of impartial journalism.
GOOD ... mais do que um filme interessante e eficiente; e uma licao civica como aquelas que o proprio Murrow se encarregava de ministrar em seu programa.
GOOD The film slowly draws the audience into the drama with utter conviction.
GOOD one of the most thoughtful, impassioned and best films of the year.
GOOD Strathairn gives a sly, quiet, unfussy performance as Murrow that sneaks up on you.
GOOD An admirable piece of work that takes a bold stand -- not just against events of the past, but events of the present. Hopefully, in the process, it can save the future.
FAIR When Murrow cautions viewers they should 'not be driven by fear into an age of unreason,' the film seems more culturally relevant than anything playing at the multiplex.
FAIR Dense, direct and digression-free.
FAIR The movie takes us back to the time when TV was at its infancy, but already marching towards its inevitable position as America's favorite waste of time ...
GOOD While the harmfulness of McCarthyism is a significant part of the film, it approaches the subject by examining the power of the media.
GOOD The use of the archival footage -- and director George Clooney's willingness to let it play out -- imbues the film with a historical heft that is more than a little unnerving.
GOOD George Clooney's second film as a director is a sharply scripted film with a terrific central performance from David Strathairn and a message that has lost none of its relevance in the last 50 years.
GOOD George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck has the visual feel of a chamber drama, with the majority of its action taking place in a handful of offices in the CBS building in New York, but the emotional gravitas of a morality play.
FAIR ...you might be safe, secure, comfortable, but you will lose something precious, something self-defining, something whose loss will make security feel pointless.
BAD Even with a tiny budget, The Worst Year of My Life has ambition, but limp acting, unoriginal story beats and lifeless characterization mires its scope.
GOOD A fascinating exercise in cinematic restraint resulting in a captivating, not to be missed film.
GOOD With A History Of Violence, Cronenberg uses the pulp gangster genre - as opposed to, say, sci-fi horror -- to draw us into a dialogue on our relationship as voyeurs to violence, both real and cinematic.
GOOD While it weakens in its final stretch...A History of Violence succeeds enormously thanks to the strength of its direction and performances.
GOOD The violence that enters the characters' perfect domestic existence is permanent, and each act reveals truths about the people who use it and the audience who enjoys it.
FAIR The movie begins slowly, methodically, and builds increasingly toward a devastating climax.
GOOD The tension builds in a slow boil, then ignites furiously when we're not quite ready for it.
FAIR Mr. Mortensen and the sparse, intelligent script hold it together.
FAIR full review in Greek
FAIR A strange David Cronenberg movie, and not in the usual audaciously morbid way. A brooding, contemplative picture that's tough, tight and masterfully controlled.
FAIR Lo mas reciente del canadiense David Cronenberg es un solido thriller, casi de factura clasica, sobre las ramificaciones de la violencia.
GOOD There are elements in this film that are 100% Cronenberg (the beautiful violence we so rarely see these days, subtle weird humor), but this is not your typical Cronenberg
GOOD What Mortensen does brilliantly is to keep us guessing.
GOOD Tematicamente ambicioso, demonstra ter seguranca suficiente da forca de sua narrativa ao permitir que o espectador saia do cinema sem estar completamente certo de como tudo terminou. E esta talvez seja uma de suas maiores virtudes.
FAIR Never does it deviate from Cronenberg's primal instincts.
BAD ... like biting into a sour pickle hidden in the bottom of your ice cream cone... simply fails to deliver what it promises to fulfill another agenda.
FAIR Three-fourths of this movie is great, but don't get me started on that ending.
BAD I have mixed feelings. Cool, engaging, well acted (William Hurt is brilliant). But could have used a bit more shaving in the editing room and a bit messy on point.
GOOD On the surface, this may seem just a violent gangster yarn, but Cronenberg has opened the door to a train of thought that becomes more disturbing the longer you consider it.
FAIR a pretty good little thriller, but clocking in at only 95 minutes, it doesn't have enough meat to be a truly satisfying drama.
BAD [David Cronenberg] no doubt wanted to say something profound about the nature of violence, but his approach betrays his intentions.
GOOD Some movies are to be consumed and discarded. History of Violence, a drama of disarming power, is not one of those. This is one of the most stirring films of the year.
BAD Olson should have studied a history of screenwriting before attempting to adapt A History of Violence. One of the most aimless, derivative films to ever be overrated.
GOOD A tense, tight and pithy thriller with such superb restraint that almost every detail matters -- and therefore shouldn't be spoiled.
GOOD A History of Violence is a fine movie that simply is too intense for many viewers.
GOOD This is Sin City with a functioning brain
GOOD Cronenberg knows this territory well, drawing parallels between sex, violence, and companionship...in this mature, compelling movie.
GOOD Violence is a turn-on, Cronenberg seems to be saying, but a turn-on that comes with a destructively high price.
GOOD There is much that is fiercely modest about its ambitions. And, for a war film, it is often disconcertingly quiet.
GOOD This is a harrowing picture, made all the more disturbing because it's based in a war that is being waged right now.
GOOD An important, intense, nail-biting experience -- really quite unforgettable.
GOOD The idea of watching people risking being blown to smithereens might not create a box office blockbuster. But this is certainly director Kathryn Bigelow's best film since Point Break in 1991.
GOOD It is visceral filmmaking at its best.
GOOD The Hurt Locker is set in present-day Baghdad, but it could be taking place anywhere in the world, at virtually any time in the last century.
GOOD It's a film about why some soldiers love war, a theme that's rare in war films made by men.
GOOD Bigelow's constantly moving camera, often jittery and restless, does well to convey the tension and latent chaos that bubbles beneath the surface of these soldiers' lives.
GOOD It is neither an anti-war film nor a pro-war film. It is, simply, a great war film about courageous men working in chaotic situations, and the collateral damage that comes with the job.
GOOD This is a film that doesn't distract with big self-aggrandizing political statements, but nevertheless succeeds in nailing the horror of the war.
GOOD The Hurt Locker transcends the political slop surrounding Iraq and cuts straight to the bone, letting us touch the hard, bloody reality of war without casualties of cliche or naive acts of emotional heroism.
GOOD Bigelow, one of the very few women working in the traditionally male-dominated action and war genres, avoids both red wire/yellow wire cliche and political preaching to deliver a film that is as psychologically fascinating as it is taut and exciting.
GOOD When the picture isn't ramping up your heart rate, it switches gears and becomes an intimate character study in what war does to humankind.
GOOD It's in refusing to plant a flag on one side or the other over the Iraq war debacle that Bigelow may just have made the conflict's defining film: words are cheap, but it's action that matters.
FAIR I wasn't exactly blown away by it (no pun intended here at all), but it remains an engaging film. There's certainly a great story to be told in here somewhere, it's just not the great film I've been hearing about.
FAIR It's not delicate by any means, and it gives an intense look into the lives of the American soldiers in Iraq.
GOOD The suspense may just kill you.
GOOD Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is one of the most thrilling action films I've seen in the past few years. It features set piece after pulse-quickening set piece.
GOOD The decade's best fictional film about its real war, it's a unique perspective on the workplace high of delivering containment from chaos. Some people kick PowerPoint's ass. Sgt. 1st Class William James saves his by defusing bombs.
GOOD Bigelow does not stint on portraying war's brutality, but the focus is strictly on the individual, not on the bigger picture, and the overall effect is more powerful and devastating for it.
GOOD Equal parts bravado-fueled action and pointed political statement. The best film yet made about the Iraq War, and the best American film about war since Platoon.
GOOD One of the few must watches of the year so far, and certainly one of the most intelligent offerings, The Hurt Locker would likely already be boasting a masterpiece label had it been from a high profile director or studio.
GOOD Combines white- knuckle tension, sizzling dialogue and poignant insight into the lives of the bravest guys in Baghdad.
GOOD A tense, occasionally meandering story about bomb defusers in Iraq.
GOOD Succeeds where so many others have failed, by crafting a compelling Iraq war film.
FAIR Not nearly as awful as it could have been...it at least knows that it's cheesy, which makes it more fun.
BAD It's not really clear why this movie was necessary %u2013 it does not reinvent the 50's movie so much as do a highly faithful cover version of it. (Gus Van Sandy's shot-for-shot remake of Psycho is a similar pointless academic exercise.)
FAIR ...gently wacky. Although breezy and sketchy on the easy laughs at times, Alien Trespass does promise to entertain for the sole purpose of its campy off-kilter makeup.
FAIR If the film succeeds perfectly in its aim, to recreate exactly a genre of films noted for how shoddy and boring they were, is it then fair to complain when the film is itself boring?
BAD Alien Trespass won't let our knowledge of the stereotypes it incorporates do the work and make the critique.
FAIR If you're willing to check your brain at the door and to suspend a lot of your disbelief, Alien Trespass manages to be a delightfully zany and campy satire best experienced at midnight with a group of friends.
FAIR A true love letter to genre days gone by, Alien Trespass delivers on its promise to bring back a slice of the good old days to horror cinema.
FAIR While it never rises to the level of Galaxy Quest, my gold standard for funny sci-fi films, Alien Trespass consistently delights and amuses.
BAD Retro-style sci-fi action spoof tries hard but doesn't work.
FAIR A highly entertaining retro Sci-fi blast from the past that is loads of fun, an endearing tribute to all those bad movies we just loved.
BAD ... once those warm, fuzzy feelings of nostalgia start to wear off, all you are left with is a tedious movie that is full of wooden performances, campy dialogue, cheesy and outdated special effects, eerie music and space beings in rubber suits.
BAD This lazy effort gets points only for truly loving -- perhaps to a fault -- the cheapo creature flicks of the 1950s.
BAD Alien Trespass, with a rating notice that mentions 'brief historical smoking,' is at least better than last year's official remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still.
BAD It's a satire without laughs, a parody without punch lines, a careful copy that replicates everything except the original's life.
FAIR How much you enjoy this strange picture depends on two things: Your appreciation of the genre that is being feted here, and the enthusiasm of the audience that you view it with.
FAIR Alien Trespass is an intriguing experiment, and I admire its craftsmanship.
BAD If you're not going to have fun with such a silly cinematic subgenre, what's the point in resurrecting it? Or, from the more pertinent audience point of view, in seeing it?
BAD A charmingly sentimental but ultimately pointless homage to the sci-fi classics of yesteryear.
BAD Fun at first, the movie quickly wears thin. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but if that's your choice, you better be sure the thing you're imitating is worthy of it.
BAD While Alien Trespass stays true to the era and the genre, it forgets that its mission in this galaxy is not merely to pay tribute but to entertain.
BAD Alien Trespass, which opens Friday on the heels of the witty Monsters vs. Aliens, feels like an also-ran.
BAD Bewildered? You won't be alone.
BAD Alien Trespass, an affectionate tribute to flying saucer movies, treats the cliches of drive-in sci-fi with touching naivete. So why isn't it more fun?
BAD To see how Alien Trespass might have been done, rent The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra with its puppet monster on visible strings, its dime-store sets and its dreadful artificial dialogue.
FAIR Alien Trespass could be the latest bulletin from Mystery Science Theatre 3000 except that we're the silhouetted heads and the filmmakers are sitting right there next to us.
FAIR At a certain point you find yourself thinking, why not watch the real It Came From Outer Space, instead of this mildly amusing replica?
BAD A pale imitation of a drive-in movie, with nothing silly or sloppy enough to qualify as camp.
BAD The plotting is too obvious, too contrived and too convenient.
GOOD Friedrich isn't particularly sharp, but Riemelt's wonderfully nuanced performance gives him intricate layers of feeling.
BAD Nearly every point made in Before the Fall, be it about militarism or the secret sexual codes of fascism, is made too obviously, or has been made before, in films from Cabaret to Europa, Europa.
FAIR It asks us to sympathize with teenage boys being groomed for National Socialist glory, and for that reason alone, it absorbs.
FAIR ... hooks you by focusing on Friedrich's very human story.
BAD One senses that Gansel took the most egregious stories from his research and stuffed them all into the shapeless script.
BAD The film is a competent but callow work dealing with a monstrous subject that automatically rejects callowness.
FAIR The best thing about Gansel's film is it doesn't ask you to absolve anyone; it only tries to make everyone a little more human.
FAIR Gansel and his screenwriting partner, Maggie Gansel, bring not a whiff of fresh nor penetrating insight to these subjects.
GOOD A work of exemplary craftsmanship, crisp and forthright yet modulated by subtle nuances, Before the Fall ranks high among the year's films.
FAIR While the background of the story is fascinating and enlightening, the foreground story could be more complex and original. The plot is a good story whose arc is a little overly familiar. Still the production values are high and the story is compelling.
FAIR The movie's own moral stance is above reproach, and the two leads are engaged enough to make you care about the outcome.
GOOD Bankrupt fascist politics and a talent in the ring combine to force decisions no teenager should have to make.
FAIR It's a handsomely mounted production that benefits greatly from location shooting and sharp attention to historical detail.
FAIR The acting is believable; the photography, atmospheric; and the moral, unmistakable.
FAIR Nazis were once innocent children -- that, at least, is the notion behind Dennis Gansel's overcooked wartime drama about the ill-fated friendship between two teenage boys at a training school for elite German military recruits.
BAD Though well-made, Before the Fall never really comes to cinematic life.
BAD I guarantee you nothing this cheesy happened during World War I.
GOOD Set in Berlin in 1942, Dennis Gansel's intensely beautiful film brings us inside Hitler's network of elite schools to groom young Germans for positions of power.
FAIR A convincing German morality play about the Nazi's amoral worship of strength and power.
BAD A polished, German-tinged Dead Poets Society with budding SS automatons subbing in for privileged Vermont WASPs.
FAIR Gansel crafts story and characters to show us a rare but possible youth of Nazi Germany whose inborn morality is not subject to "training.
BAD It was either this or watch paint dry
GOOD The football scenes are brutally real; the locker room scenes are totally authentic.
GOOD Pro football fans may be disillusioned by this excellent, honest, and often brutal expose of the play-for-pay game.
FAIR The leading man, Nick Nolte, has a physical authority and a clowning, irreverent manner that lend the film some semblance of continuity, even when it's about to flounder.
FAIR Raucous football tale with effective Nolte.
FAIR It's still fascinating to get a glimpse of what athletes sacrifice to entertain us. It would have been considerably more fascinating if more of the people involved had seemed more human.
FAIR For a sports flick, this is unique and holds your attention for the most part.
GOOD Rough and grim knuckle-fighting drama headlining Charles Bronson.
GOOD Walter Hill's first film as a director is spare, elegiac and as tough as a nickel steak.
BAD "Million Dollar Arm" is bland and overlong at 124 minutes. Simply put, there is nothing here of interest.
FAIR Based on a true story, this is one of those relentlessly uplifting Disney movies that mixes comedy and emotion to inspire and move the audience.
BAD Craig Gillespie's by-numbers schmaltzathon never transcends its tourist's-eye views of India or patronisingly cliched views of its people.
FAIR In its own gently comical way, Million Dollar Arm plays up the misunderstandings between Hollywood and India -- as well as the mutual fascination.
FAIR A likeable and agreeable movie.
GOOD Though it doesn't offer much by way of freshness, Million Dollar Arm is about as enjoyable as a predictable film gets, thanks to a feel good mix of genuine heart and wit.
GOOD It might sound like a superhero movie but Million Dollar Arm is a stirringly human drama based on a true story and a welcome reminder that extraordinary feats can be achieved by mere mortals.
BAD A cold, hard business story, reshaped by Disney into a warm, fuzzy hug.
FAIR There's nothing wildly unpredictable on offer here, but it still winningly manages to sneak its way past your defences.
GOOD The steady hand of director Craig Gillespie (whose previous work includes the off-kilter Lars and the Real Girl) is evident throughout, and the result is warm, witty and thoroughly entertaining.
BAD Hamm's charm works well playing a debonair scoundrel on television but in this bland, family friendly offering, it's a resource that's quickly drained.
GOOD Very funny underdog comedy that's genuinely heartwarming and full of charm.
FAIR A cross between Bend It Like Beckham and Cool Runnings, you can see what Disney is pitching from a mile away, but it's polished and pleasant.
BAD Hamm and Bell keep this hooey light, but you can't lob a ball in here without hitting notes played better in Jerry Maguire and Slumdog Millionaire.
FAIR As far as sports movies go, like Hamm, it's immensely likeable.
GOOD "Million Dollar Arm" benefits from a strong performance by Jon Hamm in the lead and a top-notch supporting cast.
BAD Its true story actually smells rather fishy in that almost everything about it plays as manufactured schmaltz.
BAD ...it ultimately seems obvious that this material is inherently not able to sustain a feature-length endeavor.
GOOD A Grand Slam
FAIR Achieves a certain emotional authenticity even as the viewer anticipates exactly which heart string will be plucked and how.
FAIR Million Dollar Arm scores a triple.
BAD Million Dollar Arm could be subtitled The Best Exotic Marigold Pitching Mound.
FAIR It doesn't have a mean bone in its overly long body of a script. The touch of Disney, a family-friendly PG rating and a baseball story add up to a crowd-pleaser in 'Million Dollar Arm.'
BAD Sappy, saccharine, and predictable to the point where it's almost painful.
GOOD An uplifting and inspirational tale
BAD Million Dollar Arm, you had me at Jerry Maguire.
FAIR It may not be the most memorable film out there, but Million Dollar Arm is a fine film that the whole family can enjoy.
BAD All the potential edges have been sanded off. And so, a quite remarkable true story, no matter how truthfully told, feels like a formulaic fable.
FAIR For a heart-warming movie that praises risk taking and out of the box thinking, Million Dollar Arm plays its narrative surprisingly safe.
FAIR Luckily, a terrific cast that includes Alan Arkin, Suraj Sharma, Bill Paxton, Pitobash Tripathy and Madhur Mittal holds this unwieldy thing together. (Bill Paxton, Jon Hamm or Lake Bell in the cast of any film is generally a good sign.)
FAIR Based on true events, this is a heartwarming, uplifting, feel-good family film - in the popular Disney underdog sports genre.
FAIR A charming cast makes it succeed, but a lack of willingness to really push boundaries never lets it become anything more.
BAD The best thing that can be said about Million Dollar Arm is that it wears its emotions honestly. But as a fan of baseball, I have to say that matchups are always more interesting when you go into that first inning unaware of who's going to win the game.
FAIR Feel-good sports dramedy is a fine pick for tweens.
GOOD JB is not the wisest of men and Million Dollar Arm makes no bones about him being a character in need of an upward arc. Even so, the movie never sacrifices the other characters as mere handmaidens to his growth.
FAIR Million Dollar Arm is like taking a tour bus ride with a competent guide: You know exactly where it's going, but you like the company.
GOOD Outstanding drama about morals and our choices.
GOOD Both dramatically and historically important with fine turns by Fiennes and Turturro, directed by Redford.
GOOD Acutely observed, beautifully performed, lovingly directed media morality tale that resonates far beyond its 1950s setting.
GOOD It's a blessedly old-fashioned, well-made and well-acted narrative...
FAIR ...Redford manages to build quite a snowball of drama in all of this, full of heroes and antiheroes...
GOOD Gripping, compelling, absorbing ... yeah, all those adjectives and more, This is a great movie.
FAIR A marvelous performance by Ralph Fiennes.
GOOD One of the greatest American films. Compelling scandal and heartbreaking victims.
BAD Boring movie about the most dull scandal in the history of television.
GOOD Mr. Redford has made a rich, handsome, articulate film about a subject truly worth talking about.
FAIR As a pure period piece Quiz Show delivers beautifully, but Redford's foursquare, documentary-like approach, however artful, unspools a story with about as much drama as a game show itself.
GOOD A quietly powerful take on innocence lost, its lessons apparent every time we turn on the television.
GOOD Quiz Show' is a uniquely American tragedy, told with subtlety and complexity.
GOOD Robert Redford's assurded true story about quiz show corruption is totally engrossing, with genius performances from Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro.
FAIR Redford again showed his good directorial skills and the recreation of late 1950s is almost flawless.
FAIR I have to give the film a mild thumbs up as it is an interesting story and the performance by Fiennes is worth seeing.
GOOD Aside from the impeccable structure of Paul Attanasio's screenplay, Quiz Show also works on several dichotomous levels.
GOOD The screenplay, by former Washington Post film critic Paul Attanasio, is smart, subtle and ruthless.
GOOD Manages a trick that few films even dare try -- to take a hard look at personal and public moral issues and still provide dazzling entertainment.
FAIR With the possible exception of The Shawshank Redemption, Quiz Show has the best script of any film I have seen this year.
GOOD Every characterization is full and rounded; every scene is a perfect development of theme. The dialogue is filled with crisp, subtle and quotable lines.
GOOD Crisply directed by Redford from a thought-provoking script by Paul Attanasio, and featuring a slew of strong performances.
GOOD ...an assured first feature that seems to announce the arrival of impressive cinematic sensibility.
BAD If the finale was able to match the suspenseful buildup, the scale might have tipped to make The Sleepwalker a remarkable accomplishment, rather than a letdown.
BAD Among the many unanswered questions, I ask: Where do they find this junk, and where do so many amateurs get the money to finance it?
FAIR The film soon settles into a confident, well-staged groove, primarily because of two unambiguously terrific performances.
FAIR Even if you haven't seen any of the tell-all television spots, every beat of this crime drama will look and sound familiar.
FAIR The leads make it watchable (plus it's always a hoot to see Denise Richards onscreen in any form)...
BAD None of this finds an emotional connection, and instead we watch it predictably unfold.
BAD The film's hodgepodge plot stumbles down the prototypical path of a gangster's fall from grace with a bit of Boiler Room thrown in for good measure.
FAIR Depois de capturar a imaginacao do espectador com um inicio envolvente e promissor, a historia se perde de forma irremediavel, desperdicando o imenso potencial de seus dois primeiros atos.
FAIR Moody, stylish tale of heroin dealer John Leguizamo facing the white-collar world is a well-shot debut from Franc Reyes.
FAIR Yes, we're walking those mean streets again. Good thing we're taking a few unanticipated turns.
BAD Unfortunately, Empire is nothing more than an exhausting retread of the same cliched urban cautionary tale that waxes about rebellion and redemption.
BAD The film ends up being derivative of every drug-themed, drug-centered movie we've ever seen, and goes down the same dark unforgiving and predictable path as all the others did.
BAD There isn't a redeeming character to be found in Empire which makes it awfully hard to enjoy.
BAD Try as I may, I can't think of a single good reason to see this movie, even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted, 'Thank you!' when Leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie.
BAD A yawningly familiar melodrama about an enterprising hustler who's undone by his own ambitions.
BAD A dreary rip-off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for Hispanic Americans.
FAIR An entertaining, colorful, action-filled crime story with an intimate heart.
BAD John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie.
BAD The film is shoddy and amateurish; the blood in the gunfight scenes even looks like ketchup.
BAD Feels like it was made by some old Bolsheviks, who, in a vodka stupor, thought they were remaking THE GODFATHER.
BAD If you've spent every waking moment since the summer of 1991 pining for a 'New Jack City' with a salsa soundtrack, your cinematic savior has arrived.
BAD Filmmaker Franc Reyes would have been better off skipping the elaborate scam plot and focusing on the conflicts that arise when a dealer trades in his gold chain for an Armani suit.
BAD Like its protagonist, the movie tries to rise above convention, flails about a bit, and slides back into self-parody.
BAD Empire has its visual and character attributes, but the culmination of its 90 minutes is akin to reaching out for something substantial, and coming away with nothing but thin air.
FAIR It's sort of a 21st century morality play with a Latino hip hop beat. But the second half of the movie really goes downhill.
FAIR Not much going on with this one. It was part Scarface, part New Jack City and part Sugarhill. If you've- seen these, you've seen Empire.
BAD Guns, blah, blah, blah, drugs, blah, blah, blah, guns, drugs, and money, blah, blah, blah.
BAD This tale has been told and retold; the races and rackets change, but the song remains the same.
BAD Delivers the same old same old, tarted up with Latin flava and turned out by Hollywood playas.
BAD Not atrocious, but certainly far from being as good as it might have been.
FAIR A gangster movie with the capacity to surprise.
FAIR Victor Rosa is Leguizamo's best movie work so far, a subtle and richly internalized performance.
BAD A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales.
BAD Another excuse to trot out the usual ghetto-melodramatic bromides: What Happens When You Leave the Old Neighborhood Behind and Remembering Who Your Real Posse Is and, most of all, Respecting the Woman Who Loves You Best.
BAD If Arenas is making some kind of statement with its initial release, it seems to be declaring, 'We can make a dumb Goodfellas knockoff just as well as any other ethnic group.'
BAD Empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film. It doesn't work as either.
BAD Manages to make even watching naked strippers in a hot tub a laborious experience.
GOOD This marriage of indelible imagery with electric, seemingly incongruous pop songs wouldn't be bettered until, well, the next time Scorsese decided to do it.
GOOD Features an attention-grabbing performance by Robert De Niro, but I maintain that Harvey Keitel's excellent central performance has always been critically undervalued.
GOOD Authentic in feel and immensely personal in subject matter, Mean Streets marked the arrival of one Martin Scorsese and his unique brand of urban filmmaking.
GOOD showcases Scorsese's artistic strengths and weaknesses as they stood at the outset of his career
GOOD The movie's blazing energy is still astounding; the verite street-scenes are terrific and Scorsese's pioneering use of popular music is genuinely thrilling.
GOOD A tight, intense masterpiece from Scorsese, writing collaborator Mardik Martin and the iconic stars.
GOOD The film feels authentic, the characters are true, the situation hopeless
BAD Doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid.
GOOD Terrific. Top shelf talent at the top of their game, working immediately before they would change Hollywood.
GOOD Scorsese's first masterpiece is still gripping.
GOOD One of cinema's finest moments....you'll never forget it
GOOD Perfected here are Scorsese's patented slow-motion cutaways, combination pan/tracking shots, ingenious use of pop music, and impromptu bloodbaths
GOOD The Godfather made the mob glamorous. Mean Streets made it real. Martin Scorsese's ferocious, grimy 1973 classic is just as good as Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, but it shows us criminal life lower down the food chain.
GOOD ...a gritty, one-of-a-kind, unromantic, down-and-dirty look at the streets of New York like no film had portrayed those streets and their people before.
GOOD Without exaggeration, you could make an argument for Mean Streets being the most influential film of the last fifty years.
GOOD The hilarious scene in which Charlie and Johnny Boy argue about Johnny Boy's debts in the backroom of a bar (a scene that was improvised) is alone worth the price of admission.
GOOD No matter how bleak the milieu, no matter how heartbreaking the narrative, some films are so thoroughly, beautifully realized they have a kind of tonic effect that has no relation to the subject matter.
GOOD One of Scorsese's true classics.
GOOD A true rough diamond, Scorsese's breakthrough may be uneven, but at its heart lies fledgling genius.
GOOD Its greatness lies in its leanness, with nary a word, a move, a gesture that's nonessential.
GOOD A ferociously original film.
GOOD One of those movies that you should see, even if it is only to watch a masterful director's first superior film.
GOOD Everyone involved brings a near-dizzying rhythm to this quintessential 'New York movie' and its collection of outsider-characters, all intoxicated on themselves.
GOOD In countless ways, right down to the detail of modern TV crime shows, Mean Streets is one of the source points of modern movies.
BAD A competent but self-righteous film that offers little insight into love or faith.
BAD If religious films aren't your bailiwick, stay away. Otherwise, this could be a passable date film.
BAD The film is old-fashioned, occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface.
FAIR Beers, who, when she's given the right lines, can charm the paint off the wall ... [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures.
BAD Imagine the CleanFlicks version of 'Love Story,' with Ali MacGraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes.
BAD The romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be.
GOOD Director Jennifer Jessum, who also co-produced and co-shot the film with Simon Joseph, adeptly contextualizes White's story within the painful and complex Lakota and Pine Ridge history.
FAIR Two delightful stars nudge Wild Target into sleeper territory - but only by a few inches.
FAIR ...mindless entertainment in a refined style.
BAD Wild Target is the sort of madcap comedy that breaks a sweat trying to generate a steady stream of laughs, but ... the film only works in fits and starts.
FAIR "Wild Target" has fast, quippy dialogue and exactly the right actors to drive it home.
BAD When the various elements all fizzle, all we're left with is some likable actors trying their best to save a fading film.
FAIR Snappy, sarcastic, implausible caper that looses almost all momentum 1 hour in. Also, how do you feel about Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt making out? If you just threw up in your mouth a little, you might wanna avoid this.
FAIR Saucy, scattershot, screwball farce.
FAIR The film has to fly by its wits -- and its witty lines -- and by the charm of its stars. This it does, just barely.
BAD It's never a good idea to cast Bill Nighy as a buttoned-down hit man.
BAD Screenwriter Lucinda Coxon has clearly never met a corny complication she didn't like, and Wild Target becomes riddled with irksomely madcap happenings by the final act.
BAD Rarely in a British comedy have so many richly talented actors laboured so long in search of a coherent plot, plausible characters and even a modicum of humour.
FAIR If not better than the French original, this re-make is equally good and equally funny.
BAD The film is directed with a surprising lack of comic spark by Jonathan Lynn.
BAD With an interesting premise and a capable cast, it's a shame the result is such a dead horse.
BAD A mostly admirable attempt at a Crichton-like escapade that runs out of steam a bit before half-way.
FAIR Wild Target gets its gears gunked up by a detour into the shallow, polluted waters of pseudo-psychological melodrama.
FAIR There have been a lot of black comedies about assassins lately -- there have been a few just this year -- but Wild Target may be the first one to contain genuine laughs.
FAIR An eccentric little comic thriller filled with enough laughs that I was mostly willing to overlook the fact that it makes virtually no sense as a thriller.
BAD All of this busyness drains away the film's charm, turning what might have been a naughty and whimsical frolic into something glib, hectic and sour.
BAD Since irony is so often director Jonathan Lynn's weapon of choice, Wild Target should have been a good fit. It's not quite.
BAD desperately unfunny
GOOD The movie's a grand, quick-witted entertainment, a throwback in the best, most welcome sense.
BAD Director Jonathan Lynn already made one assassin comedy ... Consider this the lazy encore no one asked for.
BAD Wild Target neatly and boringly makes a surrogate family out of its ill-matched trio of caricatures, and its epilogue of domesticity is enough to make you reach for your revolver.
BAD Nothing works.
BAD It's entertainment designed to resemble a good time without aspiring to provide one.
FAIR The likable and talented cast give it their all, but it's never as zany or funny as it should have been.
BAD Wild Target is a remake of a French farce, and it shows.
BAD Nighy and Blunt do bring a lot of warmth and charm to their roles, but thanks to a badly judged script and lazy direction, the final showdown leaves you feeling cold.
FAIR When Wild Target works it's a lot of fun. There's some decent comic chemistry between the three leads - and this is Grint's first film since Harry Potter 3 that didn't make me want to lob him out the window.
BAD This lively British remake of the 1993 French film is an enjoyable if ultimately too-silly romp. But the solid cast at least makes it watchable, even when the plot takes a series of deeply contrived turns.
BAD There's a wretched tiredness and dull reliance on formula and, hard as the cast may try, a powerful whiff of desperation not helped by the ikky prospect of Bill and Emily getting jiggy.
BAD The action hits a dead end and the laughs dry up, but it's the budding romance between the young free spirit and the crotchety old triggerman that really kills it.
BAD an interesting mess
FAIR There are moments of absolute magic.
FAIR Nearly a masterpiece
GOOD by every definition, a beautiful film: it's lovely to look at--and perhaps even moreso to listen to; and the acting is exquisite.
FAIR A good-spirited fable ... it's the type of movie that either you'll love or you'll hate. Count me in the former category.
BAD [Ben Affleck's] Jack Ryan is simply impossible to take seriously, and that's something the film could probably never survive.
BAD Generic action film not good for kids, or anyone.
FAIR Though this political adventure requires substantial suspension of disbelief, the witty script and mature approach keep the film on track. [Blu-Ray]
FAIR ... Entertaining and far more relevant than most other action/adventure movies.
BAD Has enough cliches and cut-out characters to condemn it to mediocrity.
GOOD Realizando um bom trabalho ao condensar o complexo livro de Clancy, o filme e tenso, inteligente e conta com fortes atuacoes de todo o elenco - inclusive de Affleck, que confere uma curiosa vulnerabilidade ao heroi.
GOOD It's a tired premise, and it's got its flaws, but the present talent makes it worthwhile.
FAIR Tom Clancy franchise gets a surprisingly satisfying reinvention thanks to star Ben Affleck and director Phil Alden Robinson.
FAIR It's all fast and loud and pulse-pounding, of course, but nothing that we haven't seen dozens of times on screen after imaginary disasters.
GOOD Superior genre storytelling, which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line.
FAIR The Sum of All Fears proves that the Jack Ryan franchise still has some legs. Most importantly, it also has a brain.
BAD Clancy's world is strictly for the techno-nerds and frankly they're welcome to it.
FAIR Deals with a chillingly topical nuclear attack on Baltimore. But perhaps more disturbingly, it rehashes it into a Ben Affleck action romance.
GOOD All shame aside, not being a Tom Clancy fan or Jack Ryan fan, I did quite enjoy it. Is it Morgan Freeman?
BAD An implausible apocalypse without depth or resonance, a cartoon of international politics presented with no James Bond-like playfulness and with all the superficial realism money can buy.
FAIR El filme provoca que la audiencia piense y medite sobre el mundo en que habitamos, asi como en los obsoletos sistemas de gobierno que hemos creado como sociedad.
FAIR A competent Tom Clancy thriller that's betrayed by a miscast Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan.
FAIR If nothing else, this film may stand as a cultural testament to how times really have changed since Sept. 11 -- and not necessarily the way we'd expect.
BAD (Not) the biggest or best film of this summer's blockbuster season, but it does hold up well under fire as long as you don't think about anything too hard.
FAIR To sum it up: heavy on imagination and light on reality.
GOOD A Alden Robinson, el director, le sento bien la amistad con Tom Hanks y Spielberg al haber dirigido recientemente para la TV, el drama de guerra Band of Brothers.
BAD Affleck's performance is so lightweight that he feels like a secondary character, barely involved with this struggle against a terrorist nuclear attack.
BAD The star who helped give a spark to "Chasing Amy" and "Changing Lanes" falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer's new action film, "The Sum of All Fears."
BAD ...post-September 11, "The Sum Of All Fears" seems more tacky and reprehensible, manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves.
FAIR takes on a gut-churning immediacy that is hard to deny
FAIR Sum" is Jack Ryan's "do-over." Give credit to everyone from Robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works. Especially give credit to Affleck.
GOOD Action-packed and exciting!
FAIR A tense, capably-made film that's exciting and realistic enough to satisfy filmgoers who've had their fill of Hollywood's usual ultra-unrealistic blockbuster fare.
BAD I've felt more drama watching tornado chasers on The Weather Channel.
BAD Retreads a lot of familiar elements from other "international thrillers" while occasionally dipping its foot into the real-life horror of terrorism.
BAD Affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into, a role that Ford effortlessly filled with authority.
BAD The film doesn't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously, it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA.
FAIR It's been eight years since Clear and Present Danger, but this late-blooming entry shows that none of the luster has worn off the series.
BAD Is Ben Affleck such an indispensable talent -- or box-office draw -- that his presence is worth wrecking an entire film franchise to accomodate his youth?
FAIR Affleck gets better with each film. It will be interesting to see him age with the Jack Ryan role.
BAD Never in film history will there be a more nonchalant nuclear holocaust.
GOOD The Panic in the Needle Park rolls up the drug culture's sleeve and picks at the scabs underneath.
FAIR An occasion to meditate upon the frightfulness of heroin addiction and why many youth opt for the euphoria of white powder rather than the promises of the American dream.
FAIR More a character study than any kind of narrative story, it's moderately worthwhile but far from a classic.
GOOD Alem de contar com as estupendas atuacoes de Winn e Pacino (em sua brilhante estreia no Cinema), este ainda e um dos melhores filmes ja produzidos sobre dependencia quimica.
GOOD It is not filled with quick cutting or gimmicky editing, but Jerry Schatzberg's direction is so confident that we cover the ground effortlessly.
FAIR ...a disappointingly by-the-numbers drama that rarely lives up to the effectiveness of its performances.
BAD A bore of a memoir.
GOOD The winning aspect of this adaptation of a best-selling autobiography is in the director's management of the points of view.
BAD The performances are marvelous, and little moments ring all too true, making Tucker's film rewarding if not illuminating.
FAIR It's Broadbent's movie, and he really does go from one-foot-in-the-grave to youthful and crackling-with-charisma on a dime. It's not so much that he does it, but that it seems so effortless and non-ostentatious.
GOOD A small, intimate film with numerous flashbacks like this one is trickier than it looks, but ultimately it touches the heart and proves a worthwhile journey perfectly timed for Father's Day.
GOOD ...a movie that would probably be better off as a poem.
FAIR "Father" handles things with grace, wit and a healthy dose of authenticity, staying true to author Blake Morrison's clear-eyed memoir of the same name.
BAD Frustratingly stagnant at times but ultimately a moving story about a dying father and the son who must come to terms with him.
GOOD The film puts forth the idea that the best we ever get are reflections and fragmented images of others, as if we see things entirely through prisms or distorting glass.
GOOD Firth gives one of his most stitched-up performances as the adult Blake. Maybe he overdoes it but I don't think so. His aloofness, with its awkward hesitancies and ragged bursts of feeling, means that it's all the more moving when he finally lets go.
FAIR When Firth and Broadbent share screen time, it's very watchable. Despite their proximity in real-life ages, they're convincing as son and father.
FAIR Everything in Water Lilies is more guarded, more complex and far more interesting than it seems.
GOOD In this delicate and understated portrait of selective reminiscence by Shopgirl director Anand Tucker, the now-grown son, played by Colin Firth, returns to the scene of the crime that was his childhood.
FAIR When Did You Last See Your Father? is based on a true story, but it still feels contrived.
FAIR Though ... well-acted by Firth, Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson, the slow pacing makes it feel as if everyone is walking through a waist-deep bog of emotional reserve.
FAIR An unfocused, agonized tear-jerker about loss and mourning but some of the performances are excellent.
FAIR A small, beautifully acted piece adapted from the British poet Blake Morrison's memoir.
FAIR It is all about cherishing every time you see your father.
BAD Tucker keeps things subdued almost to the point of inertia.
FAIR The film is directed and lensed with such subtlety and old-fashioned restraint that you might overlook the exquisite cinematic flourishes throughout.
FAIR Strong performances carry this familiar but always intelligent British rites-of-passage story about a philandering doctor and his much-mocked son.
FAIR Smartly, Father never ties up all its loose ends, but along the way, it is blessed with dozens of scenes in which a couple of actors connect in ways that feel deeply, humanly real.
GOOD It can be painful to watch as it so painstakingly captures the slow process of loss. But it's worth every last teardrop.
FAIR A haunting and heartfelt drama that may startle some viewers with sporadic shocks of recognition.
FAIR The acting is superior in a rather spotty story. Jim Broadbent is a consummate actor who finds the pinpricks in a dry script and sharpens them to magnify Arthur's negative characteristics.
GOOD Blake is not ready to let his father go. You'll have trouble letting the movie go too, since the characters are those you grow to care about dearly.
FAIR Tucker delivers a stroke of casting so perfect it might seem obvious: Oscar winner Jim Broadbent as the father and Colin Firth as the son.
FAIR This is a film of regret, and judging by what we see of the characters, it deserves to be.
GOOD The source is Blake Morrison's memoir of the same title, an impressionistic account that the filmmakers -- director Anand Tucker with screenwriter David Nichols -- have cast impeccably and, without losing the nuance, shaped into a strong narrative arc.
GOOD The catharsis here is all the more moving because of what wasn't finished, what remained unsaid and what in the answer to the title's question proves unknowable.
FAIR There's an air of unfinished business about it all and I'm a sucker for loose ends in the name of family dysfunction.
GOOD Mature, deeply affecting father-son drama.
BAD Even as it explores familiar deceits and self-delusions, When Did You Last See Your Father? feels, in the end, as if it's entangled in them.
FAIR When Did You Last See Your Father?&#8221; is grown-up, civilized fare, even though the whole thing might have been improved with a bit of messiness.
BAD ...a pretentious mess...
GOOD With its self-conscious references to the artistic process and to art itself (in a scene that wouldn't be out of place in a Godard project, a character reads Poe's 'The Bells,' almost in its entirety), this is Swanberg's most moving and impressive film...
FAIR Alexander the Last, a 72-minute series of loosely connected scenes, follows an actress's lurching conversations and tentative gestures in life and the theater.
FAIR Mumblecore has always lived in small moments, sometimes excruciatingly small, but rarely have these moments added up to a memorable takeaway message. Here, they do.
FAIR Swanberg aspires to the next level -- in story scope, character development, and artistic commentary -- and just misses the mark.
FAIR Part of that restless, productive team of mumblecore savants, Swanberg allows his actors to do what they do best: act.
GOOD An unabashed art film, demanding, with a measured pace and much ambiguity. It does possess some fine acting and a handsome look.
BAD Would have benefited greatly from Singer trusting his talent and assembling a Superman movie that attempted to soar beyond the heights previously achieved decades ago.
BAD For all the mountains of kryptonite ranged against him, you never fear for Superman or Lois Lane, never experience anything more intense than the fret of mild peril.
FAIR Superman Returns is a great kick start to a potentially knockout new franchise, which ultimately leaves the audience, like the people of Metropolis when its greatest hero returns to the skies, brimming with hope.
GOOD None of which would register if Routh weren't a Superman whom if we don't need we can at least feel for.
FAIR Underneath its mechanical safety and mild-manners, this movie does have some heart and some muscle. You'll come to like having it around, even if you thought you'd already moved on.
FAIR Superman Returns is a bombastic, rousing, explosive burst of summer fun and fantasy, enriched by its predecessors and rejuvenated by the new blood and slavish religious devotion of director Bryan Singer.
GOOD Solid and emotionally direct but not the concussive powerhouse many will be hoping for.
GOOD the tragedy of 9/11 and Lois' super sex with the 'man of steel' are two major selling points of the film, but they remain as sublimated as Clark Kent's secret identity.
GOOD Ignore the hype, ignore the budget, ignore the expectations, sit back, relax and let Superman return.
BAD The Man of Steel as a morally-compromised and ethically-challenged figure has the potential to be quite compelling, but if and only if he is portrayed as confronting his demons in a more meaningful way.
FAIR better than 3 and 4
FAIR Resembling Reeve both physically and vocally, Routh certainly has large red boots to fill. And he fills them admirably
FAIR Yes, the new Superman Returns movie flies. It just doesn't soar.
FAIR After nearly 20 years in hiding, one would expect Superman's return to be special. Alas, the most noteworthy thing about director Bryan Singer's new movie is the hype surrounding it.
FAIR click to read full review [Greek]
BAD Emphasizes the reasons I don't find Superman all that interesting.
GOOD It's been 5 years since Superman (Brandon Routh) left Earth to search for the remains of his home planet Krypton. Upon his return, the Man of Steel discovers a world in turmoil and a changed Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) - engaged to be married and the mothe
FAIR The film's weaknesses aside, there is no denying that Singer has pulled out all the stops in his bid to make the biggest, loudest summer blockbuster possible.
GOOD Superman returns with a vengeance.
FAIR In a time where the youth of this nation are fighting and dying to defend this country, the film argues that each one of us can be super under the right circumstance.
BAD Quite capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound, [but] does so without much care or conviction.
GOOD Super return for Superman ...
FAIR A good start at revitalizing a dead series. Get rid of Kevin Spacey for the sequel and you might have something spectacular.
GOOD As a superhero film it's really extremely impressive, probably higher in quality than even the first X-Men film and right up there with the Spiderman films.
GOOD This Superman takes flight like few before and one wonders whether the film's minor flaws mean only that the sequel, like Singer's X2, is destined to become a real classic of the genre.
GOOD Romantica, emocionante, trepidante, mistica y entranable, es un digno homenaje al heroe mas grande del mundo y un perfecto ejemplo de que el cine sigue siendo la fabrica de suenos, pues ahora, mas que nunca, es posible creer que un hombre puede volar.
FAIR The battle is won: but only just.
FAIR Many happy returns, Superman, you've been away too long. Unfortunately, you deserve a lot better than this.
GOOD It's all about heart -- not that the spectacle falters; this is the finest popular entertainment since the Rings trilogy closed. Superman doesn't fly -- he soars.
BAD Filme auto-indulgente e sem ritmo que transforma o Homem de Aco em um gala sem personalidade.
GOOD The effects are terrific - you will, indeed, believe a man can fly, especially during a showstopping set-piece involving an out-of-control aeroplane.
FAIR The plane taking off, flying and nearly crashing into the earth almost serves as a metaphor for the entire Superman Returns experience.
GOOD El Hombre de Acero vuela nuevamente y, ademas de Lex Luthor, ahora enfrenta a un nuevo enemigo: el olvido.
GOOD Spirited and somewhat bittersweet, Superman Returns remains a fascinating and very entertaining ride most of the way %u2014 though it's probably at least 20 minutes too long for optimum interest.
GOOD ...enjoyable enough for the casual fan, and the superinitiated are going to find plenty of details to worry and rub. It's got humor and a reservoir of respect for the character's history and place in American culture.
GOOD Five bravos to Bryan Singer and his team for showing us that Superman's heart is commensurate with the power in his muscles. I'm all wrapped up in his cloak.
FAIR The Man of Steel returns in body but not quite in spirit.
GOOD Its politics are abhorrent to me, but my god, it's such a slick, well-crafted thriller ... that I can't hate it
FAIR A tense thriller that holds your attention to the very end. The film is aided by one of Bernard Hermann's better scores.
BAD Tedious remake of a "thriller" that wasn't that thrilling to begin with
GOOD Keep-you-up-all-night terrifying!
FAIR The remake with De Niro had the most to fear from this superior little thriller!
GOOD A classic revenge thriller.
GOOD works best as a twisted nail-biter, punctuated brilliantly with an apocalyptic score by Bernard Herrmann
BAD A sempre presente narracao em off e um dos muitos problemas do filme - especialmente se considerarmos que o narrador e justamente um escritor mediocre.
BAD An actor gives writing and directing a try, with the usual results.
GOOD A most welcome, utterly delightful treat.
