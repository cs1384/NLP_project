0.625 <|###|> The acting is excellent and the bickering is the best. ... Director Iris Green and the terrific cast leave us with a lot of promise for future films.
0.875 <|###|> Lukas Moodyson's debut feature has a grainy, immediate feel that nicely enhances the story's emotional honesty -- a quality that our own popular teen movies have only just begun to embrace.
0.8 <|###|> Nobody can deny the honesty or the outright sincerity this film has.
0.75 <|###|> Dahlstrom and especially Liljeberg are first-rate.
0.875 <|###|> Unfortunately, as the plot develops, it shies away from exploring that discontent, in favor of demonstrating precisely the kind of naivete and sweetness that one would expect to find in any teen romance.
0.875 <|###|> It's just an incredibly insightful character drama about true, awkward, beautiful first love, and it's all the better for it. Oh, and that last shot is as cute as it gets.
0.75 <|###|> High school, small town, teenagers in hormone hell -- or is that heaven?
0.9 <|###|> A completely charming reality-based romantic fantasy, both sweet-natured and sympathetic.
0.75 <|###|> The movie is funny, gentle, and true.
0.5 <|###|> The film has some charm and a winning simplicity but not an iota of depth.
0.5 <|###|> I'm tired of teens talking about make-up and making out. A lesbian twist to an otherwise standard story just isn't enough to make it compelling.
0.75 <|###|> Successfully captures the frenzied angst and boredom of youth, as well as the powerful, unbridled emotions of first love.
0.8 <|###|> A poignant exploration of the cruelty and anguish of teenage existence.
1.0 <|###|> Right away this film grabs attention with documentary-style close- ups and upends teen movie cliches.
0.8 <|###|> Incredibly fun, incredibly entertaining, and worth watching in all respects.
0.8 <|###|> A breath of fresh air in a genre too often controlled by Hollywood teen-pap.
0.875 <|###|> One of the most honest and heartfelt teen dramas ever to grace the screen.
0.75 <|###|> Director To doesn't sacrifice substance to style. The over-the-top violent flourishes, more psychological than paint-the-screen-red literal, will burrow under your skin.
0.6 <|###|> Whatever he lacks in narrative drive, To is still the master of style.
0.8 <|###|> The exposition is perfectly balanced with bloody action and muscular set-pieces.
0.875 <|###|> The film's violence erupts in rare, staccato bursts, all the more horrifying for coming out of nowhere.
0.6 <|###|> If it is too stylistically modest to win converts among the multiplex crowd, the film surely rewards followers of the genre.
0.875 <|###|> If Machiavelli's The Prince and Sun Tzu's The Art of War translate to other centuries and cultures, so might Election and Triad Election.
0.75 <|###|> [Director To's] talent for documentary-style realism and navigating complex political systems sets him apart, though his nationalism puts him squarely in the mainstream.
0.5 <|###|> The moviea(TM)s most powerful component is political.
0.75 <|###|> This remains a well-crafted genre movie, and one that promises further developments in its final scene.
0.625 <|###|> Like the late John Frankenheimer, director To marries his drama with action and superb composition to achieve compelling results at times.
0.875 <|###|> Into a season of Hollywood blockbusters, this import arrives with the impact of a high-velocity bullet.
0.8 <|###|> Like any good sequel, this film takes what is familiar with the original's concept -- in this case, an internecine struggle for supremacy -- and deepens it.
0.625 <|###|> Triad Election is slow-burning and sedate, even dull in stretches. But it deserves credit for presenting such a courageous critique of the Chinese system, which combines the worst aspects of official corruption and mob lawlessness.
0.625 <|###|> Like many Hong Kong mob movies, Triad Election</i is not about fleshed-out characters or intricate stories. It's a blunt, grimly efficient action movie that underlines the lies gangsters tell themselves so they, at least, can believe they're good guys.
0.875 <|###|> Johnny To's superb, graceful new Triad Election actually has quite a bit in common with Francis Coppola's Godfather trilogy.
0.8333333333333334 <|###|> The director rejuvenates the genre by connecting the dots between a criminal subculture and a much bigger sociological picture. He's finally given HK cinema its very own Godfather.
0.75 <|###|> Two screenwriters were responsible for this fascinating look at organized crime in China, as well as the continuing governmental policies that make the triads thrive.
0.875 <|###|> Comparisons to The Godfather Part II are inevitable. For a change, such comparisons are also favorable.
0.8 <|###|> Guided by To's elegant camera moves, less visceral than most Hong Kong filmmakers, the Election movies put a fresh, intriguing spin on the usual cinematic gangster motifs.
0.75 <|###|> Ready for The Godfather with a distinctly Hong Kong flavor?
0.75 <|###|> Plenty of films owe a debt to The Godfather, but it's rare to see inspiration used as successfully as it is here.
0.8 <|###|> expertly captures the battle between old-school gangster pathology and the new cutthroat tactics of the corporate criminal
0.75 <|###|> The parallels to all three Godfather films are there, if you care to look, but the Election films have other pleasures.
0.9 <|###|> The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller Triad Election as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier.
1.0 <|###|> Maybe you don't know much about this director. But if you like Hong Kong action movies where everyone's constantly killing each other in a ballet of bullets (and other weapons), then [Johnny To] is your new Francis Ford Coppola.
0.875 <|###|> This disturbing social order, both inside and outside the Triad, is the series' defining characteristic. Because of its emphasis, this installment satisfies, even if another sequel feels inevitable.
0.625 <|###|> Election 2 is equal in precision to its predecessor, exuding a perpetual sense of danger.
0.75 <|###|> The unusually subtle yet eloquent debut of Israeli director Haim Tabakman...
0.75 <|###|> The movie respects the Jewish tradition of inquiry and debate; it unreels as a sort of dramatic dialogue that acknowledges the benefits and terrors of both religious fundamentalism and personal freedom.
0.6 <|###|> This restrained piece from first-time Israeli film-maker Haim Tabakman explores the tension between faith and sexuality in Jerusalem.
0.6 <|###|> The simplicity of the tale is its strength and the acting of Zohar Strauss as Aaron and Ran Danker as Ezri is entirely natural.
0.9 <|###|> It's almost impossible to imagine anyone making a gay romance between two orthodox Jews. And yet this film is subtle and sensitive, and full of earthy honesty as it explores a seriously difficult situation.
0.75 <|###|> A sensitively directed and movingly acted story of forbidden love.
0.8 <|###|> A very human story quietly unfolds with a compelling understatement in this dour but deeply-felt drama from director Haim Tabakman.
0.6 <|###|> This is responsible, restrained and intelligent, but if anything, the risky subject material is handled with too much caution.
0.2 <|###|> Director Haim Tabakman avoids sensationalism so assiduously that his film has slightly less eroticism than the average party political broadcast.
0.8 <|###|> It's not just the subject matter of impossible love that recalls Brokeback Mountain, but the same aching sadness and pathos.
1.0 <|###|> One of the best and most moving love stories you'll ever see. Absolutely top draw.
0.6 <|###|> Tabakman makes evocative use of enclosed spaces and silences, and tempers the melodrama with a sociological authenticity that confirms the centrality of belief in Jewish culture.
0.8 <|###|> Slow and often silent, it's an extraordinarily disciplined film that respects, if not honours, the milieu of its story...
0.4 <|###|> Worthy in theme, honourable in intent, oddly bloodless in execution.
0.6 <|###|> Director Haim Tabakman conjures up the sad mood very skilfully, with natural lighting, measured pace and an unexpected electronic soundtrack. In fact, it's probably my favourite film about the romantic love between two Jewish guys since Superbad.
0.6 <|###|> The film's urgent point about the need for understanding is made with dignity and an appreciable tinge of sorrow.
0.6 <|###|> Impressively directed, thought-provoking and emotionally engaging drama that plays like an orthodox Jewish version of Brokeback Mountain, though the pacing and minimalistic dialogue might prove too arthouse for some tastes.
0.875 <|###|> As oblique and laconic as its characters, Tabakman's moral tale rises to a melancholy spirituality.
0.9 <|###|> "Brokeback Mezuzah": Tender, affecting, brave, and beautifully wrought,
0.825 <|###|> Brave, provocative and gently engrossing with well-nuanced performances.
0.9 <|###|> It moves slowly and patiently through the ordeal of a single soul, illuminating in the process a cosmos of intense and hidden feeling.
0.625 <|###|> Quiet, sober and tense, the movie makes some interesting points, but it lacks the emotional firepower of Brokeback Mountain.
0.6 <|###|> The drama's moments of inspiration vindicate its desultory proceedings.
0.6 <|###|> Haim Tabakman's feature directing debut fascinates for the powerful, multi-layered themes that percolate beneath its visually spare and delicately told story.
0.8 <|###|> Unusually sensitive look into the hearts of nonconformists in an extremely conforming community as the different risks they take and the choices they make are quite moving.
0.6 <|###|> Bellocchio famously took on the Catholic Church and the Italian family in his frenetic first film ... Now 40 years later, Bellocchio's attack on the same institutions is calmer and more temperate.
0.75 <|###|> Enigmatic and mesmerizing.
0.75 <|###|> An artful look at religious hypocrisy, interfamily dynamics and the way people wrestle with personal history long after the original events are over.
0.75 <|###|> It's a bit of a mess but strong stuff nevertheless.
0.75 <|###|> Exceptionally handsome, somber film.
0.5 <|###|> It's almost as if screenwriter/director Marco Bellocchio wants to exorcise personal demons rather than entertain.
0.625 <|###|> The quizzically abrupt ending leaves [too many] questions, and the viewer, hanging.
0.75 <|###|> It is a riveting, rich portrait of an atheist who thinks he's resistant to faith but may be in the throes of a feverish conversion.
0.8 <|###|> Bellocchio's complex drama is held together by the tight and focused performance of Castellitto.
0.6 <|###|> It's a sly, subtle portrait of systematic hypocrisy (try to count the number of times faith is referred to as an 'insurance policy') and the mysterious way fate binds children to their parents.
0.625 <|###|> An edgy drama unwinds with an emotional letdown.
1.0 <|###|> This superbly filmed Italian drama stands with Bellocchio's best work.
0.8 <|###|> Marco Bellocchio's expansive, memorable film floats and plummets like a box kite in a storm on drafts of melodrama, mysticism and humor.
0.6 <|###|> My Mother's Smile overflows with mildly interesting ideas and characters, but the end result is decidedly tepid.
0.6 <|###|> Flawed but fascinating portrait of Vatican politics.
0.625 <|###|> Bellocchio has a way of spelling everything out for the audience; nonetheless, the film's intellectualism is both provocative and remarkably playful.
