GOOD Excellent updating of the classic drama
GOOD Not nearly as good as the original, but still an incredible film.
GOOD Nowhere near the original, but still worthy of high praise.
FAIR This remake is worth viewing for the strength of the script and the fine performances.
FAIR You may not want to hang around [Hunter S. Thompson] all the time, but he would be a pretty interesting guy to have over for breakfast.
GOOD ...wildly entertaining...
FAIR Do we get to know the real Hunter through viewing Breakfast with Hunter? Possibly. More than ever before, at least.
GOOD Breakfast With Hunter is a cinematic exploration that is perhaps the closest you can get to Hunter Thompson without scoring an invite up to the 'fortified compound'.
FAIR Takes a peculiarly predictable and conventional approach to its study of the godfather of gonzo journalism, Hunter S. Thompson
BAD Curiously prosaic for the wicked incisiveness of its subject.
GOOD Ever wish you could see what goes on behind those famed, heavily fortified walls of Owl Farm? Here's your invitation.
FAIR Jon Favreau's charismatic and convincing performance as the boxing legend is enough to recommend this biopic.
BAD Rocky Marciano was a knockout of a fighter to say the least. It's too bad Winkler's movie about him carries no particular punch
GOOD Superb production with memorable Sinise performance in title role.
GOOD An excellent biopic anchored by a marvelous job by Sinise.
FAIR Its Cliffs Notes approach to the source biography gets a big boost from star Gary Sinise.
