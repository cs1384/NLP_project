0.625 <|###|> The bar has been set so low in mainstream Hollywood movies that it's not even worth seriously analyzing this stuff
0.625 <|###|> This one had the most potential, and in that way it is the most disappointing.
0.75 <|###|> A fitting capstone on a collection of screen classics for the ages!
0.625 <|###|> The only one of the trilogy that actually works as both a good Summer movie and a solid sci-fi movie in its own right.
0.7 <|###|> full review in Greek
0.8 <|###|> For me, Sith succeeds in providing a satisfying ending to the films while also closing a chapter of my own life.
0.8 <|###|> It did what I thought was impossible after the previous two films: it made me a Star Wars fan again.
1.0 <|###|> A great Star Wars film and, dare I say, a great film onto itself.
0.4 <|###|> As blockbusters go, Revenge of the Sith has some good throwaway entertainment, but there have been better blockbusters with better throwaway entertainment.
0.625 <|###|> The best thing about Episode III? Jar Jar Binks is barely in it.
0.5 <|###|> Although the stiff theatrics are part of the design, they're no longer excusable.
0.8 <|###|> What makes this movie work is watching Anakin Skywalker break our hearts, and ultimately serve as a textbook example of how the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
0.9 <|###|> In years to come George Lucas's farewell to his STAR WARS series may be considered his finest entry.
0.75 <|###|> Against all odds, the movie becomes more than the sum of its creaky parts, building enough emotional firepower to destroy an entire hard-bitten cynic such as myself.
0.8 <|###|> This is the film we yearned for as we sat passively through the shoddy merchandise-oriented Phantom Menace and the dull romantic scenes of Attack of the Clones.
0.9 <|###|> For the 6th time in a row, George Lucas has done it again.
0.6 <|###|> Why are blinds wipes and Fisher-Price spaceship interiors employed in a 2005 film?
0.6 <|###|> Star Wars was a gamble in 1977. In 2005 Revenge of the Sith is the Empire.
0.8 <|###|> Prepare to be blown away because George Lucas&#146;'s latest space opera is an absolute belter, recalling the old magic of The Empire Strikes Back and banishing forever painful memories of the last two Star Wars prequels.
0.8 <|###|> Episode III hooks up to its sequel of 1977 as neatly as a space station landing dock.
0.6 <|###|> Veering from moments of breathtakingly visualized valor to outright stupidity, Sith is a vast improvement over the previous two outings, but still and all, it's no Star Wars.
0.8 <|###|> I am pleased to report that George Lucas has found his way back from the Dark Side.
0.75 <|###|> As popcorn entertainment, strapping in for Star Wars: Episode III is like hooking up with an old friend. Half the enjoyment is simply the idea of the reunion itself.
0.75 <|###|> As with the last two Star Wars movies, Revenge of the Sith is a visual spectacle, trotting out the best special effects Industrial Light and Magic has to offer.
0.875 <|###|> ...at once a work of closure and of sustenance.
0.8 <|###|> To Star Wars fans everywhere, a celebration of galactic proportions.
0.75 <|###|> ...the brilliant final showdown between Obi-Wan and Anakin for his soul is the moment that takes the Star Wars saga where it needs to go ...
0.7 <|###|> So boxed in by having to tie everything into a neat parcel that it feels constrained and is woefully lacking in surprises and dramatic tension.
0.6 <|###|> Spectacular ... but it never really lifts you up into a new imaginative realm -- it never takes you away. It just keeps blazing at you.
0.625 <|###|> It's not to say there's not a lot wrong with the film, but rather to suggest that the chief criticisms of it being strange and "a mess" aren't among them.
0.6 <|###|> An often fascinating mess, but a mess all the same.
0.25 <|###|> There's the obese Brando pretending to be God while dressed in gauzy white robes like a demented pope
0.8 <|###|> Amazingly, Kilmer delivers an odder performance than Brando. Creepy retelling.
0.5 <|###|> In its final third, the movie goes to hell in more ways than Frankenheimer intended.
0.625 <|###|> The most exciting characters are killed off too early, and what we're left with is a Satan's "Seasme Street."
0.2 <|###|> I'm sure it looked good on paper. That and Kilmer's frighteningly apt mimicry of Brando's voice are about the only positive things I can say.
0.5 <|###|> The movie keeps switching focus without ever getting its bearings, and when Brando exits earlier than expected, there's little but mayhem to fall back on.
0.8 <|###|> Uneven; definitely has its moments.
0.2 <|###|> Things are so cheap they didn't even spring for uniforms for the so-called cops; everybody seems to be wearing their street clothes.
0.7 <|###|> The film is driven more by its concept than by its plot but it's still a fun summer film.
0.625 <|###|> Expensive, a misfire, but perfectly servicable for what it is
0.6 <|###|> Delivers on the promise of an exciting genre mash-up but, even with a talented cast and revered team of writers, fails to weave a fulfilling story.
0.6 <|###|> Patchy, if enjoyable in parts, but nowhere near as awesome as that title suggests it should be.
0.5 <|###|> Jon Favreau's "Cowboys & Aliens" is a film that starts off with promise, but quickly loses its way as it tries to merge two different genres.
0.75 <|###|> Rather refreshingly what-you-see-is-exactly-what-you-get: a western with aliens grafted on, or a sci-fi invasion film with cowboys grafted on--nothing more, nothing less.
0.4 <|###|> A mercilessly boring, wasted opportunity that forgets to have a sense of humor, charisma, or aliens.
0.25 <|###|> While we were hoping and rightly expecting some old school magic from the director of Iron Man, the director of Iron Man 2 showed up.
0.75 <|###|> 'Reach for the skies' has a whole new meaning now. The science-fiction Western 'Cowboys & Aliens' is an entertaining, genre-blending romp. It's a serious movie, too - a drama with comedic moments - and that makes it all the more exciting.
0.6 <|###|> Not the Boys Own Adventure it could have been, but a fun - if often flawed - romp.
0.4 <|###|> No amount of gee-whiz techno-wizardry or nifty pop-cultural juxtapositions can save Cowboys & Aliens from two terrible truths: it has a dud script, and a dud director.
0.5 <|###|> full review at Movies for the Masses
0.7 <|###|> we get a standard story, some decent setpieces and only a few funny lines...Take the ride, but don't blame us if you end up saddle sore.
0.6 <|###|> Uma diversao eficiente que, sim, poderia ter explorado sua otima premissa com mais cuidado, mas que ao menos nao a desperdicou com "homenagens" tolas e auto referenciais.
0.4 <|###|> The two marquee stars don't interact much, the "big" action pieces are fairly ho-hum, and the movie just cowpokes along when it seems like it should be having a lot more galloping fun.
0.875 <|###|> I don't think too many people are going to wander into the theater expecting The Tree of Life. The film delivers exactly what it promises.
0.4 <|###|> So in much the same way that 'Transformers' is essentially a robot war with a few humans stumbling around trying to get laid; this film should really have been called 'Alien Bracelet Vs. Aliens... With Some Cowboys Falling Off Their Horses'.
0.5 <|###|> The cowboys: great. The aliens: not so much. There's fun to be had here, but it falls way short of the pulp classic it could have been.
0.4 <|###|> A film where the occasional sense of fun is far outweighed by the omnipresent sense of stupid.
0.3 <|###|> Overall, a dull, overblown and forgettable farrago.
0.7 <|###|> There is nothing that fascinating about Favreau's treatment, nor his source material, but compared with similar blockbuster fare of recent months, this curious exercise in genre bending is very watchable.
0.6 <|###|> There's no doubt seeing a cowboy leap from a horse on to a spaceship is all kinds of awesome.
0.6 <|###|> I wanted to more than love Cowboys & Aliens. For two hours I wanted to feel 17 again.
0.4 <|###|> The men's relationship is dull and under-explored and the plot is slow, unexciting and silly. Craig is a lot more fun in a tuxedo than a stetson.
0.6 <|###|> If you can swallow the shameless set-up, it's all highly entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> Jon Favreau handles the big setpieces with competence if no great flair; whenever the plot backs itself into a corner something else will make a sudden, inexplicable interruption.
0.8 <|###|> A wild and spaced-out horse opera.
0.4 <|###|> This is definitely a film of two halves - the first is a fantastic western-mystery, the second is a lazy and silly sci-fi.
0.4 <|###|> Why has there never been a film about cowboys beating up extra-terrestrials? This movie will give you a pretty good idea.
0.4 <|###|> Favreau ... allows the material's imaginative possibilities to flare up and fade away.
0.0 <|###|> The density of inanity at the conceptual core of this crass sci-fi western starring Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford pushes outwards, inflating fatuous substance and propelling bric-a-brac in all directions.
0.6 <|###|> The premise does pretty much what it says on the tin.
0.6 <|###|> For all its A-list ingredients of concept, cast and director, the resulting mash-up is merely a superior B-movie, as uncertain a fusion as potato on a pizza.
0.4 <|###|> Yes, yes, cowboys punching aliens in the face can be funny. But it doesn't make this silly endeavour worthwhile.
0.4 <|###|> The plot has so many holes and unexplained phenomena that it's hard to know where to begin.
0.4 <|###|> Craig is a bona fide action star who shouldn't be reduced to spitting out lines like "Demons took your gold" in a husky Southern drawl.
0.6 <|###|> Jon Favreau made a really good comic book adaptation out of the original Iron Man but like every director he's dependant on a good screenplay and this one relies on cliches and having taken on this mix of genres it actually isn't wild enough conceptually.
0.5 <|###|> Unfortunately, Cowboys and Aliens takes itself way too seriously to really ignite.
0.4 <|###|> What started as 'True Grit'-meets-'War of the Worlds' ends up closer to - whisper it - 'Wild Wild West'.
0.6 <|###|> Enjoyable, well made and superbly acted sci fi-slash-Western adventure that duly delivers both cowboys and aliens, though a little bit of humour wouldn't have gone amiss.
