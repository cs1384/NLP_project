0.75 <|###|> A throwback action movie that invokes 1980s nostalgia in all the right ways.
0.8 <|###|> The Last Stand is a fast-paced, action-heavy throwback, shot with a fluid visual eye by Kim Jee-Woon. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back and better than ever.
0.5 <|###|> As action movies go, it's okay. There are some good ideas underneath and an attempt develop them, but only an attempt. And though time has moved on, Schwarzenegger himself hasn't. As a hero's triumphal return goes, it's more of a whimper.
0.6 <|###|> Arnie lurches through the film with a kind of defiant dignity, his signature mixture of self-effacing humour and good ol' tough talk allowing us to buy into the kind of big-screen hero he made us fall in love with all those decades ago.
0.6 <|###|> Director Jee-woon Kim (I Saw the Devil) knows how to fill up the screen, surround his megastar with economy-sized murders, car chases, billowing blood-clouds and goofiness.
0.6 <|###|> The film, though underdeveloped, is rife with big guns, flippant one-liners, improbable battles, high-octane car chases and way too much testosterone - all the hallmarks of a classic Schwarzenegger film.
0.6 <|###|> ...it's refreshing to watch a film that wants to be nothing more than a blood-soaked accompaniment to beer and pizza.
0.2 <|###|> The gimmick of Schwarzenegger's return to cinema wears off quickly. A bland bullet riddled excuse for an action flick.
0.6 <|###|> The Last Stand sees bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger return to the big screen following an eight-year term as Governor of California, because that is the reality we now occupy... A fun, dumb, enjoyable, dumb, mostly well performed, super dumb film.
0.5 <|###|> Mindless, dumb fun as Arnie grunts a few one liners and tries to terminate an escaped drug lord who's in a fast car and heading for freedom.
0.7 <|###|> Despite some graphic violence and even though it is really silly, this is an entertaining action film showing that Arnold Schwartzenegger has not lost any of his charm.
0.5 <|###|> Surely the former governor of the state could have come across a better script for his return to the big screen in a starring role.
0.75 <|###|> No, he doesn't demonstrate a lot of 'Terminator'-style moves.But, hey, he doesn't have to. Schwarzenegger, now in his mid-60s, just needs to tote some weapons, seek revenge and utter a few one-liners, which is exactly what he does in 'The Last Stand.'
0.4 <|###|> Arnie stomps his way through a role in which every punch looks clumsy and every line of dialogue sounds like it has been learnt phonetically.
0.8 <|###|> "The Last Stand" could be an old episode of "Gunsmoke," with its theme of the law versus the bad guys.
0.625 <|###|> An entertaining, if not particularly longed for, return for the 65-year-old action icon.
0.6 <|###|> The results are surprisingly good fun, popcorn-friendly, and awfully redolent of Rio Bravo. Fine by us. He's back, alright.
0.5 <|###|> Korean filmmaker Kim played with the Western genre before in his wacky 2008 pastiche The Good the Bad the Weird, and this film is just as chaotically uneven, mixing cartoon-style silliness with grisly violence.
0.625 <|###|> There isn't much of a story here, though it's great to see Arnold back where he belongs.
0.625 <|###|> Satisfied customers may include undiscriminating action fans, Luis Guzman completists and Wayne LaPierre (one bad guy meets his reward when he trespasses on the property of a shotgun-toting granny).
0.6 <|###|> As comebacks go, Schwarzenegger has chosen a really good vehicle with which to remind people of how he became so popular in the first place.
0.6 <|###|> If slick nostalgia is what you're after, The Last Stand is for you.
0.6 <|###|> It's entertaining, if a little (a lot) silly.
0.6 <|###|> It's good to see Arnie moving back to the kind of public service he does best.
0.6 <|###|> An action star is (re)born.
0.6 <|###|> A suitably lightweight comeback for Arnie, The Last Stand does just enough to please his legion of fans, and proves the action icon still has charisma to spare.
0.6 <|###|> Korean film-maker Kim Jee-woon gives it plenty of directorial welly, and it's good to see a film with cop cars flying through the air.
0.6 <|###|> Arnold is back as an action hero, and playing someone near his own age. Therefore the movie is more believable and thus more entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> A zippier, zestier film than ... its own hackneyed premise suggests.
0.4 <|###|> A creaky, lethargic and daft action thriller ...
0.6 <|###|> Many things are blown up, in some style.
0.8 <|###|> Entertaining, pleasingly old-school Arnie action thriller, enlivened by stylish direction, strong performances and some nice ideas.
0.45 <|###|> Cool to see Arnold back. I just wish the movie was a little better.
0.4 <|###|> Where the film could have been self-aware and a little cleverer for it, director Jee-woon Kim misses a trick by sticking to the action formula.
0.625 <|###|> That Second Amendment sure kicks ass.
0.6 <|###|> This has its moments - what Scorsese film does not? -- but over a two-and-a-half-hour stretch it huffs and puffs and still doesn't blow the house down.
0.875 <|###|> There's a lot of tough talk from tough men in this testosterone-fueled thriller, as the thin blue line disintegrates amid gritty give-and-take in William Monahan's excellent script.
0.9 <|###|> The Departed is a near-perfect synthesis of cinematic genius and commercial appeal, quite possibly the most accomplished and accessible film from one of the greatest living directors.
0.8 <|###|> Bloody, brutal and brilliant -- DiCaprio and Nicholson shine in the crime movie of 2006.
0.9 <|###|> The shocking violence is well-placed. The action scenes are always comprehensible -- no jump cut cheats here -- and the suspense will make you fidget in your seat. What a corker.
1.0 <|###|> The best of its kind since Michael Mann's Heat.
0.8 <|###|> This is rich and satisfying stuff with Scorsese rediscovering his masterful skill at delivering a narrative which crackles with acid dialogue delivered by a gifted cast.
0.6 <|###|> As ingenious as it is artificial.
0.8 <|###|> Nicholson's unsavoury grin and seedy menace are a joy to behold.
1.0 <|###|> Rude, profane, clever, hilarious, engrossing, crowd-pleasing, ridiculously entertaining.
0.8 <|###|> As cop thrillers go, this is the best in quite a while.
0.5 <|###|> I think GoodFellas leaves this for dead, absolutely for dead.
1.0 <|###|> The Departed is not for the faint of heart. But scaredy-cats are going to miss a tremendously satisfying film, one that will have you leaving the theater saying, "Now, that was a movie."
0.8 <|###|> It all makes for extremely watchable entertainment.
0.8 <|###|> This is Scorsese's Serpico, his French Connection, his Heat, and he brings the same eye for anthropological detail to the boys in blue as he does to his beloved wiseguys.
0.8 <|###|> Scorsese finds himself back in his comfort zone with a crime epic about loyalty and deception that's deeply engaging and viciously entertaining from start to bloody finish.
0.9 <|###|> Urban film making at its best, The Departed is a brutally violent, beautifully crafted, and incredibly well acted piece of film making that will leave you reeling.
0.59 <|###|> The film is superbly shot, and the rapid-fire editing and shaky camera fit the constant flux that the main characters find themselves in time and again.
0.6 <|###|> Much splat, little art
0.75 <|###|> Scorsese isn't about plots; he's about people, places, and times, and until he departs from that, this film is a return to genius.
0.8 <|###|> One of the year's very best and most exciting films.
0.9 <|###|> The Departed heralds Martin Scorsese's return to the top of his game and simultaneously secures for the film a place in the pantheon of the very best of American crime cinema. Welcome back to Scorsese's mean streets.
0.4 <|###|> Scorsese revisits old territory in The Departed, and he doesn't do anything he hasn't done brilliantly several times before.
0.875 <|###|> Probably the director's most taut piece of storytelling since Goodfellas.
1.0 <|###|> What makes this a Scorsese film, and not merely a retread, is the director's use of actors, locations and energy, and its buried theme. I am fond of saying that a movie is not about what it's about; it's about how it's about it.
0.75 <|###|> Director To doesn't sacrifice substance to style. The over-the-top violent flourishes, more psychological than paint-the-screen-red literal, will burrow under your skin.
0.6 <|###|> Whatever he lacks in narrative drive, To is still the master of style.
0.8 <|###|> The exposition is perfectly balanced with bloody action and muscular set-pieces.
0.875 <|###|> The film's violence erupts in rare, staccato bursts, all the more horrifying for coming out of nowhere.
0.6 <|###|> If it is too stylistically modest to win converts among the multiplex crowd, the film surely rewards followers of the genre.
0.875 <|###|> If Machiavelli's The Prince and Sun Tzu's The Art of War translate to other centuries and cultures, so might Election and Triad Election.
0.75 <|###|> [Director To's] talent for documentary-style realism and navigating complex political systems sets him apart, though his nationalism puts him squarely in the mainstream.
0.5 <|###|> The moviea(TM)s most powerful component is political.
0.75 <|###|> This remains a well-crafted genre movie, and one that promises further developments in its final scene.
0.625 <|###|> Like the late John Frankenheimer, director To marries his drama with action and superb composition to achieve compelling results at times.
0.875 <|###|> Into a season of Hollywood blockbusters, this import arrives with the impact of a high-velocity bullet.
0.8 <|###|> Like any good sequel, this film takes what is familiar with the original's concept -- in this case, an internecine struggle for supremacy -- and deepens it.
0.625 <|###|> Triad Election is slow-burning and sedate, even dull in stretches. But it deserves credit for presenting such a courageous critique of the Chinese system, which combines the worst aspects of official corruption and mob lawlessness.
0.625 <|###|> Like many Hong Kong mob movies, Triad Election</i is not about fleshed-out characters or intricate stories. It's a blunt, grimly efficient action movie that underlines the lies gangsters tell themselves so they, at least, can believe they're good guys.
0.875 <|###|> Johnny To's superb, graceful new Triad Election actually has quite a bit in common with Francis Coppola's Godfather trilogy.
0.8333333333333334 <|###|> The director rejuvenates the genre by connecting the dots between a criminal subculture and a much bigger sociological picture. He's finally given HK cinema its very own Godfather.
0.75 <|###|> Two screenwriters were responsible for this fascinating look at organized crime in China, as well as the continuing governmental policies that make the triads thrive.
0.875 <|###|> Comparisons to The Godfather Part II are inevitable. For a change, such comparisons are also favorable.
0.8 <|###|> Guided by To's elegant camera moves, less visceral than most Hong Kong filmmakers, the Election movies put a fresh, intriguing spin on the usual cinematic gangster motifs.
0.75 <|###|> Ready for The Godfather with a distinctly Hong Kong flavor?
0.75 <|###|> Plenty of films owe a debt to The Godfather, but it's rare to see inspiration used as successfully as it is here.
0.8 <|###|> expertly captures the battle between old-school gangster pathology and the new cutthroat tactics of the corporate criminal
0.75 <|###|> The parallels to all three Godfather films are there, if you care to look, but the Election films have other pleasures.
0.9 <|###|> The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller Triad Election as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier.
1.0 <|###|> Maybe you don't know much about this director. But if you like Hong Kong action movies where everyone's constantly killing each other in a ballet of bullets (and other weapons), then [Johnny To] is your new Francis Ford Coppola.
0.875 <|###|> This disturbing social order, both inside and outside the Triad, is the series' defining characteristic. Because of its emphasis, this installment satisfies, even if another sequel feels inevitable.
0.625 <|###|> Election 2 is equal in precision to its predecessor, exuding a perpetual sense of danger.
0.625 <|###|> The bar has been set so low in mainstream Hollywood movies that it's not even worth seriously analyzing this stuff
0.625 <|###|> This one had the most potential, and in that way it is the most disappointing.
0.75 <|###|> A fitting capstone on a collection of screen classics for the ages!
0.625 <|###|> The only one of the trilogy that actually works as both a good Summer movie and a solid sci-fi movie in its own right.
0.7 <|###|> full review in Greek
0.8 <|###|> For me, Sith succeeds in providing a satisfying ending to the films while also closing a chapter of my own life.
0.8 <|###|> It did what I thought was impossible after the previous two films: it made me a Star Wars fan again.
1.0 <|###|> A great Star Wars film and, dare I say, a great film onto itself.
0.4 <|###|> As blockbusters go, Revenge of the Sith has some good throwaway entertainment, but there have been better blockbusters with better throwaway entertainment.
0.625 <|###|> The best thing about Episode III? Jar Jar Binks is barely in it.
0.5 <|###|> Although the stiff theatrics are part of the design, they're no longer excusable.
0.8 <|###|> What makes this movie work is watching Anakin Skywalker break our hearts, and ultimately serve as a textbook example of how the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
0.9 <|###|> In years to come George Lucas's farewell to his STAR WARS series may be considered his finest entry.
0.75 <|###|> Against all odds, the movie becomes more than the sum of its creaky parts, building enough emotional firepower to destroy an entire hard-bitten cynic such as myself.
0.8 <|###|> This is the film we yearned for as we sat passively through the shoddy merchandise-oriented Phantom Menace and the dull romantic scenes of Attack of the Clones.
0.9 <|###|> For the 6th time in a row, George Lucas has done it again.
0.6 <|###|> Why are blinds wipes and Fisher-Price spaceship interiors employed in a 2005 film?
0.6 <|###|> Star Wars was a gamble in 1977. In 2005 Revenge of the Sith is the Empire.
0.8 <|###|> Prepare to be blown away because George Lucas&#146;'s latest space opera is an absolute belter, recalling the old magic of The Empire Strikes Back and banishing forever painful memories of the last two Star Wars prequels.
0.8 <|###|> Episode III hooks up to its sequel of 1977 as neatly as a space station landing dock.
0.6 <|###|> Veering from moments of breathtakingly visualized valor to outright stupidity, Sith is a vast improvement over the previous two outings, but still and all, it's no Star Wars.
0.8 <|###|> I am pleased to report that George Lucas has found his way back from the Dark Side.
0.75 <|###|> As popcorn entertainment, strapping in for Star Wars: Episode III is like hooking up with an old friend. Half the enjoyment is simply the idea of the reunion itself.
0.75 <|###|> As with the last two Star Wars movies, Revenge of the Sith is a visual spectacle, trotting out the best special effects Industrial Light and Magic has to offer.
0.875 <|###|> ...at once a work of closure and of sustenance.
0.8 <|###|> To Star Wars fans everywhere, a celebration of galactic proportions.
0.75 <|###|> ...the brilliant final showdown between Obi-Wan and Anakin for his soul is the moment that takes the Star Wars saga where it needs to go ...
0.7 <|###|> So boxed in by having to tie everything into a neat parcel that it feels constrained and is woefully lacking in surprises and dramatic tension.
0.6 <|###|> Spectacular ... but it never really lifts you up into a new imaginative realm -- it never takes you away. It just keeps blazing at you.
0.7 <|###|> Funny for families of all ages, this animated comedy is a rare and delightful treat.
0.75 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits is cinematic booty that shines like gold.
0.8 <|###|> The Pirates! is the first truly great animated film of the year: a painstakingly-modelled laugh riot that boggles the mind while tickling the funnybone.
0.625 <|###|> It's got great vocal talent and well-done animation, but it proves once again that the story is the key ingredient.
0.9 <|###|> A rollicking good time that offers enough broad comedy mixed with more cerebral sight gags to ensure this will be a family favourite for years to come.
0.625 <|###|> It's full of jokes for adults that will fly right over kids' heads, but retains just enough plot conflict and slapstick to keep younger audiences involved as well.
0.7 <|###|> The Aardman folks might not have created a pirate film to rival the big screen's best, but they've created a subtle parody of pirate movies that's well worth watching.
0.85 <|###|> Yes, the film feels childish, but in the best possible way.
0.6 <|###|> ... enough amusing throwaway gags to keep us entertained.
0.6 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits deserves two doubloons up. It shivered me funny bone.
0.875 <|###|> The fun, infectious tone is set early on and never peters out. The humor is kind of like Monty Python for kids.
0.75 <|###|> Droll and charming, and will probably appeal more to fans of Monty Python and 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' than to young kids...
0.8 <|###|> This is a very funny, very good looking movie getting lost in the fray.
0.75 <|###|> The best laughs come around the fringes, with great throwaway gags and Grant's usual self-deprecating way with dialogue.
0.5 <|###|> A few funny lines and a great vocal turn by Hugh Grant. All else is unexciting. Can't see the kids going wild over this one.
0.7 <|###|> Deserves no small amount of credit for being an absolute delight... and for never acting like the viewer is an idiot even as it never requires that the viewer be a genius.
0.8 <|###|> As a running gag, the man-panzee is pretty predictable, but as an observation of how cute creatures are perpetually manipulated and abused in family entertainments, it is rather rich.
0.875 <|###|> It's hard to emphasize enough just how intricate it is, abundant with rich details... At the same time, it's also warmly human, with characters so expressive you'll want to join the crew.
0.8 <|###|> The majority of the film can't quite live up to this barnstorming first half hour, but it remains a delight throughout, even when the gags become a little more hit and miss.
0.75 <|###|> Another winner from Aardman
0.5 <|###|> I wish I could call the plot about a dodo bird 'whimsical,' but there just wasn't enough laughs from these 'Pirates.'
0.5 <|###|> The filmmakers have said they are already dreaming up a sequel. They needn't hurry. Whatever treasures these pirates have are well buried.
0.7 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits, succeeds in spite of a faint but persistent sense of factory settings and finishes.
0.625 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits fares OK against most modern toon flicks but pales next to other Aardman releases. How a person chooses to rate its success depends on whether one looks at a glass of water and views it as half-full or half-empty.
0.8 <|###|> a gem of a movie that deserves more praise and audience than it'll probably get
0.875 <|###|> Delivers all of the laughs, giggles and guffaws land lubbers like us want in a silly film like this.
0.6 <|###|> There is a lot to like about The Pirates!, especially for those of us who watch a lot of BBC America.
0.6 <|###|> Young and old alike love a good pirate yarn and the stop-motion specialists at Aardman Animations deliver the goods.
0.8 <|###|> Pirate adventure blends Victorian history, high-seas fun.
0.8 <|###|> Pirates haven't generated this many laughs since Johnny Depp's first dip into the Caribbean.
0.8 <|###|> Even with all the enormous pirate ships, detailed cityscapes and dazzling action, Pirates! is at its best when it focuses on the sillier, calmer moments.
0.6 <|###|> Chaotic and far-fetched yet funny enough to have audiences rolling in the aisles.
0.4 <|###|> Given the broad drama of the series, their movie should be full of big ideas, and instead settles for redundant gags involving drugs, guns, and high school cliques.
0.875 <|###|> Remake or no, this movie is hysterical.
0.8 <|###|> 21 Jump Street gets the remake job done with tongue-in-cheek style & plenty of outrageous moments.
0.75 <|###|> Because of Bacall's skill at writing great comedic material and Lord's and Miller's talent behind the camera, "21 Jump Street" became more than what it originally appeared to be, which is a surprise I'm always grateful for.
0.85 <|###|> 21 Jump Street takes the basic concept of the original series, and uses it to create an action/comedy that is not only palatable to modern audiences, but appealing as well.
0.625 <|###|> Co-written, produced by, and stars Jonah Hill, who took exactly the right attitude towards the movie: He and his costar Channing Tatum embraced the stereotypes, laughed at themselves, and came up with a surprisingly funny film.
0.75 <|###|> ...feels more like a guerrilla stunt than a soulless and cynical cash grab. Hooray for Hollywood, I guess.
0.8 <|###|> Slick and funny as hell, 21 Jump Street is one of the best comedies of the year.
0.875 <|###|> A raucous, entertaining, and incredibly funny film that respects the premise of the original series...
0.6 <|###|> For an action comedy, "21 Jump Street" had less action or comedy than I expected. It felt as if I spent too much time waiting for something to happen-either for a joke to fire, or a pistol.
0.8 <|###|> The movie is perfectly pleasant, a smidgen too aware of itself but consistently sharp.
0.6 <|###|> While the film struggles at the start as Tatum and Hill share little chemistry, they improve minute by minute and are one of the shining lights by the end, their journey boasting a surprising emotional pull.
0.86 <|###|> t's less fun when the guns come out in the final act, but there's a moment late in the game that redeems the movie's predictable beats, before the whole thing dissolves into entropy and disorder.
0.7 <|###|> 21 Jump Street is nothing like the original series. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry and the strong beginning and ending do a pretty good job disguising the flabby middle. It's crass, self effacing, 'meta', stupidity and it works.
0.875 <|###|> Clever, profane and action-packed, '21 Jump Street' fairly leaps onto the big screen as one of the most enjoyable movies of the (still-admittedly young) year.
0.8 <|###|> The best comedy to be released so far this year.
0.8 <|###|> I'm as surprised as you that this film could end up being the funniest of 2012.
0.75 <|###|> Lord and Miller mine the script... for plenty of profane laughs as they set up Hill and Tatum as a hilariously off-kilter comedy duo.
0.5 <|###|> ...it doesn't help, either, that large chunks of the film have been improvised wholesale by the various actors, which only exacerbates the film's excessively slapdash feel.
0.375 <|###|> ... latest in endless slew of painful spoofs based on TV shows takes an OK premise and milks it for an occasional chuckle before devolving into a succession of increasingly lame sketches.
0.5 <|###|> They know it's a joke. But like high school itself, 21 Jump Street hits the wall about halfway in and even prom night can't save it.
0.8 <|###|> The humor squeezes just about all the giggle juice it can get out of the R rating. If you need a movie map, this 21 Jump Street is on the FAR side of town from Sesame Street.
0.625 <|###|> by no means a great comedy, but it does demonstrate that playing against the grain can be a good move, especially when the people in charge have run out of ideas
0.8 <|###|> It doesn't matter if you never saw the original, because this movie is a clever, fast-paced, action comedy...
0.9 <|###|> A good-natured must-see for fans of broad, silly comedies with a little something under the surface too. Bright, breezy and brilliant.
0.8 <|###|> It is funny because it is pointed and smart, and it is also funny because it is unusually crass, but the chief takeaway here should be that it is funny.
0.75 <|###|> Rigorous planning likely was involved in taking the dumb concept of "21 Jump Street" and turning it into something that seems so effortlessly brilliant.
0.7 <|###|> While hardly raising the bar in action-comedy, it's still a fun, irreverent, laugh-out-loud take on the beloved, small-screen original.
0.7 <|###|> I won't go so far as to say it's good, but 21 Jump Street is certainly better than it has any right to be.
0.7 <|###|> The humor may be coarse and crude but it is funny, and with these movies that is what counts.
0.4 <|###|> 21 Jump Street is a cockamamie movie. It's as rowdy as a dick joke. After the 21st dick joke, I wanted to jump off. And after the dick jokes there's a load of excrement jokes.
0.6 <|###|> It has a tone all its own: drunk enough to lower the inhibitions; not so drunk that it becomes unintelligible.
0.625 <|###|> Funny and clever but ultimately dispiriting, with a finale that affirms the queasy wink-wink legalized bullying of its early police-vs.-citizens scenes, and that associates manhood with a willingness to kill with a gun -- all for a cheap laugh.
0.8 <|###|> 21 Jump Street is as fresh and original a comedy you'll ever find that is based on a totally stolen concept. If only all Hollywood rip-offs could be this good.
0.7 <|###|> The film is driven more by its concept than by its plot but it's still a fun summer film.
0.625 <|###|> Expensive, a misfire, but perfectly servicable for what it is
0.6 <|###|> Delivers on the promise of an exciting genre mash-up but, even with a talented cast and revered team of writers, fails to weave a fulfilling story.
0.6 <|###|> Patchy, if enjoyable in parts, but nowhere near as awesome as that title suggests it should be.
0.5 <|###|> Jon Favreau's "Cowboys & Aliens" is a film that starts off with promise, but quickly loses its way as it tries to merge two different genres.
0.75 <|###|> Rather refreshingly what-you-see-is-exactly-what-you-get: a western with aliens grafted on, or a sci-fi invasion film with cowboys grafted on--nothing more, nothing less.
0.4 <|###|> A mercilessly boring, wasted opportunity that forgets to have a sense of humor, charisma, or aliens.
0.25 <|###|> While we were hoping and rightly expecting some old school magic from the director of Iron Man, the director of Iron Man 2 showed up.
0.75 <|###|> 'Reach for the skies' has a whole new meaning now. The science-fiction Western 'Cowboys & Aliens' is an entertaining, genre-blending romp. It's a serious movie, too - a drama with comedic moments - and that makes it all the more exciting.
0.6 <|###|> Not the Boys Own Adventure it could have been, but a fun - if often flawed - romp.
0.4 <|###|> No amount of gee-whiz techno-wizardry or nifty pop-cultural juxtapositions can save Cowboys & Aliens from two terrible truths: it has a dud script, and a dud director.
0.5 <|###|> full review at Movies for the Masses
0.7 <|###|> we get a standard story, some decent setpieces and only a few funny lines...Take the ride, but don't blame us if you end up saddle sore.
0.6 <|###|> Uma diversao eficiente que, sim, poderia ter explorado sua otima premissa com mais cuidado, mas que ao menos nao a desperdicou com "homenagens" tolas e auto referenciais.
0.4 <|###|> The two marquee stars don't interact much, the "big" action pieces are fairly ho-hum, and the movie just cowpokes along when it seems like it should be having a lot more galloping fun.
0.875 <|###|> I don't think too many people are going to wander into the theater expecting The Tree of Life. The film delivers exactly what it promises.
0.4 <|###|> So in much the same way that 'Transformers' is essentially a robot war with a few humans stumbling around trying to get laid; this film should really have been called 'Alien Bracelet Vs. Aliens... With Some Cowboys Falling Off Their Horses'.
0.5 <|###|> The cowboys: great. The aliens: not so much. There's fun to be had here, but it falls way short of the pulp classic it could have been.
0.4 <|###|> A film where the occasional sense of fun is far outweighed by the omnipresent sense of stupid.
0.3 <|###|> Overall, a dull, overblown and forgettable farrago.
0.7 <|###|> There is nothing that fascinating about Favreau's treatment, nor his source material, but compared with similar blockbuster fare of recent months, this curious exercise in genre bending is very watchable.
0.6 <|###|> There's no doubt seeing a cowboy leap from a horse on to a spaceship is all kinds of awesome.
0.6 <|###|> I wanted to more than love Cowboys & Aliens. For two hours I wanted to feel 17 again.
0.4 <|###|> The men's relationship is dull and under-explored and the plot is slow, unexciting and silly. Craig is a lot more fun in a tuxedo than a stetson.
0.6 <|###|> If you can swallow the shameless set-up, it's all highly entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> Jon Favreau handles the big setpieces with competence if no great flair; whenever the plot backs itself into a corner something else will make a sudden, inexplicable interruption.
0.8 <|###|> A wild and spaced-out horse opera.
0.4 <|###|> This is definitely a film of two halves - the first is a fantastic western-mystery, the second is a lazy and silly sci-fi.
0.4 <|###|> Why has there never been a film about cowboys beating up extra-terrestrials? This movie will give you a pretty good idea.
0.4 <|###|> Favreau ... allows the material's imaginative possibilities to flare up and fade away.
0.0 <|###|> The density of inanity at the conceptual core of this crass sci-fi western starring Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford pushes outwards, inflating fatuous substance and propelling bric-a-brac in all directions.
0.6 <|###|> The premise does pretty much what it says on the tin.
0.6 <|###|> For all its A-list ingredients of concept, cast and director, the resulting mash-up is merely a superior B-movie, as uncertain a fusion as potato on a pizza.
0.4 <|###|> Yes, yes, cowboys punching aliens in the face can be funny. But it doesn't make this silly endeavour worthwhile.
0.4 <|###|> The plot has so many holes and unexplained phenomena that it's hard to know where to begin.
0.4 <|###|> Craig is a bona fide action star who shouldn't be reduced to spitting out lines like "Demons took your gold" in a husky Southern drawl.
0.6 <|###|> Jon Favreau made a really good comic book adaptation out of the original Iron Man but like every director he's dependant on a good screenplay and this one relies on cliches and having taken on this mix of genres it actually isn't wild enough conceptually.
0.5 <|###|> Unfortunately, Cowboys and Aliens takes itself way too seriously to really ignite.
0.4 <|###|> What started as 'True Grit'-meets-'War of the Worlds' ends up closer to - whisper it - 'Wild Wild West'.
0.6 <|###|> Enjoyable, well made and superbly acted sci fi-slash-Western adventure that duly delivers both cowboys and aliens, though a little bit of humour wouldn't have gone amiss.
