FAIR a safe, enjoyable movie that can be watched by yourself, on a date or at your mother's house after Sunday dinner
BAD It teeters between pleasantly generic film biography and rank manipulation.
FAIR You could go see this just to enjoy the production design.
GOOD Diane Lane delivers one of the finest performances of her career.
BAD Secretariat is cliched, unrealistic and predictable, but it will make you feel good
FAIR This horse-sports-opera boasts all the ingredients for a successful run.
FAIR Celebrates greatness on four legs with a decent--if not record-breaking--amount of light entertainment. What're the odds?
FAIR Easily as good of a film as "Seabiscuit," and family-friendly.
FAIR A heavily contrived and overlong account of the greatest US horse in racing history, Disney's Secretariat still has a lot going for it as an old-fashioned family drama.
BAD Secretariat is a good-natured but thunderingly cliched triumph-against-the-odds tale, almost every line a cornball aphorism about following your heart.
BAD Like Secretariat himself, the film is a glossy, big-hearted slow- starter, but lacks his ability to power home ahead of the competition.
BAD I'm sick of the simpering American morons who lap up this rubbish.
FAIR With its linear structure, nostalgic glow and distinct lack of surprises, Secretariat seems to have wandered into cinemas after leaving its TV movie hitching post.
BAD Just when we thought John Malkovich didn't have another semi-intentionally deranged performance left in him, he has come storming back with another uproarious turn...
GOOD I think this is one of the year's most enjoyable family films.
BAD Despite a decent performance from Lane as the homespun trainer, Secretariat is more blind alley than Blind Side.
BAD This tale of wealth, horse-breeding and good old Christian faith is just about as hammy as a study of commodified horse sex can be.
BAD Secretariat's story still feels untold.
BAD Don't put money on it.
BAD Bum-numbingly long bore that has a worrying number of talented actors seemingly involved for a cheque. Watch a film about dinosaurs instead; much more fun.
FAIR This horsey, 1970s-set Disney film doesn't boast the most imaginative script and is too long and businesslike for youngsters -- yet it still produces a lump in the throat.
BAD Disappointing, frequently dull racehorse drama that's let down by poorly written characters, a thinly stretched plot, a painful lack of dramatic tension and a cliche-heavy script.
FAIR Yes, it's a good, solid movie about a horse that no one expected to win.
FAIR Penny Chenery's story is good stuff. It's just that watching it, one can't escape the nagging feeling that it's not the most compelling part of the (Secretariat) story.
GOOD ... you will believe a horse can act.
BAD Secretariat is basically an amiable crowd pleaser. It's a good film about a great horse.
FAIR If you like sweet, safe tales of triumph, Secretariat is a sure bet. But if you like films with a bit more tension and complexity, this romp doesn't completely satisfy.
GOOD ...oldstyle Hollywood, family entertainment done at a very high level. It doesn't lay out all the facts and complications, but it's a very honest movie.
FAIR Despite the Disney-fied, sentimental side of the story, 'Secretariat' hits the finish line as an effective tale about an amazing equine athlete
FAIR Well-crafted, shamelessly -- and obviously -- manipulative fantasyland stuff, passing itself off as a 'true story,' when, in fact, it's what we call 'fact-based.
BAD Watching Secretariat is an experience as antithetical to watching an actual horse race as it gets.
BAD Schmaltzy, uneven and contrived [despite] thrilling horse-racing scenes and John Malkovich's hilarious performance as an eccentric trainer who walked right out of a Christopher Guest movie.
FAIR The horse's story entertains but it would have been nice to have more of the owner's personal life explored
BAD Crushingly unexceptional.
BAD It's not about a horse, it's jockey, or it's trainer. It's about a horse owner. Instead of honoring the greatest race horse ever, they try to find an underdog story with Diane Lane's help.
FAIR Secretariat rides to the Winner's Circle.
FAIR Like most Disney features, it is an inspirational event that will touch everyone.
GOOD A throwback to an era where Disney churned these things out by the dozen, you?ll cheer, you?ll laugh, and wish you?d brought a hanky. There is, however, no photo finish.
FAIR Until the Sports Illustrated subscription runs out at the Walt Disney Studios offices, I expect audiences will continue to be privy to cookie-cutter yarns centered around notable achievements in the sports world.
FAIR Jon Favreau's charismatic and convincing performance as the boxing legend is enough to recommend this biopic.
BAD Rocky Marciano was a knockout of a fighter to say the least. It's too bad Winkler's movie about him carries no particular punch
GOOD The football scenes are brutally real; the locker room scenes are totally authentic.
GOOD Pro football fans may be disillusioned by this excellent, honest, and often brutal expose of the play-for-pay game.
FAIR The leading man, Nick Nolte, has a physical authority and a clowning, irreverent manner that lend the film some semblance of continuity, even when it's about to flounder.
FAIR Raucous football tale with effective Nolte.
FAIR It's still fascinating to get a glimpse of what athletes sacrifice to entertain us. It would have been considerably more fascinating if more of the people involved had seemed more human.
FAIR For a sports flick, this is unique and holds your attention for the most part.
