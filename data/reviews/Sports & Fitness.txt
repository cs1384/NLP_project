0.6 <|###|> a safe, enjoyable movie that can be watched by yourself, on a date or at your mother's house after Sunday dinner
0.5 <|###|> It teeters between pleasantly generic film biography and rank manipulation.
0.6 <|###|> You could go see this just to enjoy the production design.
0.8 <|###|> Diane Lane delivers one of the finest performances of her career.
0.5 <|###|> Secretariat is cliched, unrealistic and predictable, but it will make you feel good
0.6 <|###|> This horse-sports-opera boasts all the ingredients for a successful run.
0.6 <|###|> Celebrates greatness on four legs with a decent--if not record-breaking--amount of light entertainment. What're the odds?
0.7 <|###|> Easily as good of a film as "Seabiscuit," and family-friendly.
0.6 <|###|> A heavily contrived and overlong account of the greatest US horse in racing history, Disney's Secretariat still has a lot going for it as an old-fashioned family drama.
0.4 <|###|> Secretariat is a good-natured but thunderingly cliched triumph-against-the-odds tale, almost every line a cornball aphorism about following your heart.
0.4 <|###|> Like Secretariat himself, the film is a glossy, big-hearted slow- starter, but lacks his ability to power home ahead of the competition.
0.4 <|###|> I'm sick of the simpering American morons who lap up this rubbish.
0.6 <|###|> With its linear structure, nostalgic glow and distinct lack of surprises, Secretariat seems to have wandered into cinemas after leaving its TV movie hitching post.
0.2 <|###|> Just when we thought John Malkovich didn't have another semi-intentionally deranged performance left in him, he has come storming back with another uproarious turn...
0.8 <|###|> I think this is one of the year's most enjoyable family films.
0.4 <|###|> Despite a decent performance from Lane as the homespun trainer, Secretariat is more blind alley than Blind Side.
0.2 <|###|> This tale of wealth, horse-breeding and good old Christian faith is just about as hammy as a study of commodified horse sex can be.
0.4 <|###|> Secretariat's story still feels untold.
0.4 <|###|> Don't put money on it.
0.4 <|###|> Bum-numbingly long bore that has a worrying number of talented actors seemingly involved for a cheque. Watch a film about dinosaurs instead; much more fun.
0.6 <|###|> This horsey, 1970s-set Disney film doesn't boast the most imaginative script and is too long and businesslike for youngsters -- yet it still produces a lump in the throat.
0.4 <|###|> Disappointing, frequently dull racehorse drama that's let down by poorly written characters, a thinly stretched plot, a painful lack of dramatic tension and a cliche-heavy script.
0.75 <|###|> Yes, it's a good, solid movie about a horse that no one expected to win.
0.625 <|###|> Penny Chenery's story is good stuff. It's just that watching it, one can't escape the nagging feeling that it's not the most compelling part of the (Secretariat) story.
0.8 <|###|> ... you will believe a horse can act.
0.5454545454545454 <|###|> Secretariat is basically an amiable crowd pleaser. It's a good film about a great horse.
0.625 <|###|> If you like sweet, safe tales of triumph, Secretariat is a sure bet. But if you like films with a bit more tension and complexity, this romp doesn't completely satisfy.
0.88 <|###|> ...oldstyle Hollywood, family entertainment done at a very high level. It doesn't lay out all the facts and complications, but it's a very honest movie.
0.625 <|###|> Despite the Disney-fied, sentimental side of the story, 'Secretariat' hits the finish line as an effective tale about an amazing equine athlete
0.6 <|###|> Well-crafted, shamelessly -- and obviously -- manipulative fantasyland stuff, passing itself off as a 'true story,' when, in fact, it's what we call 'fact-based.
0.25 <|###|> Watching Secretariat is an experience as antithetical to watching an actual horse race as it gets.
0.51 <|###|> Schmaltzy, uneven and contrived [despite] thrilling horse-racing scenes and John Malkovich's hilarious performance as an eccentric trainer who walked right out of a Christopher Guest movie.
0.6 <|###|> The horse's story entertains but it would have been nice to have more of the owner's personal life explored
0.5 <|###|> Crushingly unexceptional.
0.5 <|###|> It's not about a horse, it's jockey, or it's trainer. It's about a horse owner. Instead of honoring the greatest race horse ever, they try to find an underdog story with Diane Lane's help.
0.75 <|###|> Secretariat rides to the Winner's Circle.
0.6 <|###|> Like most Disney features, it is an inspirational event that will touch everyone.
0.8 <|###|> A throwback to an era where Disney churned these things out by the dozen, you?ll cheer, you?ll laugh, and wish you?d brought a hanky. There is, however, no photo finish.
0.625 <|###|> Until the Sports Illustrated subscription runs out at the Walt Disney Studios offices, I expect audiences will continue to be privy to cookie-cutter yarns centered around notable achievements in the sports world.
