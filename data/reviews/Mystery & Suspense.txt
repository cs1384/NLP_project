0.6 <|###|> Really quite fun. Up to a point.
0.6 <|###|> The plot may sound fairly simplistic but underneath the blood and guts there's a biting satire about rich cosseted students signing up to causes they hardly understand.
0.625 <|###|> The Green Inferno receives a palpable shot in the arm from the characters' initial arrival into the tribe's primitive camp...
0.75 <|###|> A fun and interesting twist on the travelogue sub-genre of horror ... far better than many horror movies with twice the budget.
0.7 <|###|> A very slow start threatens to derail The Green Inferno, but once the terror begins, it never lets up and Roth once again proves why he's a master of horror.
0.7 <|###|> if you want an absolutely brutal experience that's tough to endure, just like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, this is probably the movie for you.
0.75 <|###|> A throwback action movie that invokes 1980s nostalgia in all the right ways.
0.8 <|###|> The Last Stand is a fast-paced, action-heavy throwback, shot with a fluid visual eye by Kim Jee-Woon. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back and better than ever.
0.5 <|###|> As action movies go, it's okay. There are some good ideas underneath and an attempt develop them, but only an attempt. And though time has moved on, Schwarzenegger himself hasn't. As a hero's triumphal return goes, it's more of a whimper.
0.6 <|###|> Arnie lurches through the film with a kind of defiant dignity, his signature mixture of self-effacing humour and good ol' tough talk allowing us to buy into the kind of big-screen hero he made us fall in love with all those decades ago.
0.6 <|###|> Director Jee-woon Kim (I Saw the Devil) knows how to fill up the screen, surround his megastar with economy-sized murders, car chases, billowing blood-clouds and goofiness.
0.6 <|###|> The film, though underdeveloped, is rife with big guns, flippant one-liners, improbable battles, high-octane car chases and way too much testosterone - all the hallmarks of a classic Schwarzenegger film.
0.6 <|###|> ...it's refreshing to watch a film that wants to be nothing more than a blood-soaked accompaniment to beer and pizza.
0.2 <|###|> The gimmick of Schwarzenegger's return to cinema wears off quickly. A bland bullet riddled excuse for an action flick.
0.6 <|###|> The Last Stand sees bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger return to the big screen following an eight-year term as Governor of California, because that is the reality we now occupy... A fun, dumb, enjoyable, dumb, mostly well performed, super dumb film.
0.5 <|###|> Mindless, dumb fun as Arnie grunts a few one liners and tries to terminate an escaped drug lord who's in a fast car and heading for freedom.
0.7 <|###|> Despite some graphic violence and even though it is really silly, this is an entertaining action film showing that Arnold Schwartzenegger has not lost any of his charm.
0.5 <|###|> Surely the former governor of the state could have come across a better script for his return to the big screen in a starring role.
0.75 <|###|> No, he doesn't demonstrate a lot of 'Terminator'-style moves.But, hey, he doesn't have to. Schwarzenegger, now in his mid-60s, just needs to tote some weapons, seek revenge and utter a few one-liners, which is exactly what he does in 'The Last Stand.'
0.4 <|###|> Arnie stomps his way through a role in which every punch looks clumsy and every line of dialogue sounds like it has been learnt phonetically.
0.8 <|###|> "The Last Stand" could be an old episode of "Gunsmoke," with its theme of the law versus the bad guys.
0.625 <|###|> An entertaining, if not particularly longed for, return for the 65-year-old action icon.
0.6 <|###|> The results are surprisingly good fun, popcorn-friendly, and awfully redolent of Rio Bravo. Fine by us. He's back, alright.
0.5 <|###|> Korean filmmaker Kim played with the Western genre before in his wacky 2008 pastiche The Good the Bad the Weird, and this film is just as chaotically uneven, mixing cartoon-style silliness with grisly violence.
0.625 <|###|> There isn't much of a story here, though it's great to see Arnold back where he belongs.
0.625 <|###|> Satisfied customers may include undiscriminating action fans, Luis Guzman completists and Wayne LaPierre (one bad guy meets his reward when he trespasses on the property of a shotgun-toting granny).
0.6 <|###|> As comebacks go, Schwarzenegger has chosen a really good vehicle with which to remind people of how he became so popular in the first place.
0.6 <|###|> If slick nostalgia is what you're after, The Last Stand is for you.
0.6 <|###|> It's entertaining, if a little (a lot) silly.
0.6 <|###|> It's good to see Arnie moving back to the kind of public service he does best.
0.6 <|###|> An action star is (re)born.
0.6 <|###|> A suitably lightweight comeback for Arnie, The Last Stand does just enough to please his legion of fans, and proves the action icon still has charisma to spare.
0.6 <|###|> Korean film-maker Kim Jee-woon gives it plenty of directorial welly, and it's good to see a film with cop cars flying through the air.
0.6 <|###|> Arnold is back as an action hero, and playing someone near his own age. Therefore the movie is more believable and thus more entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> A zippier, zestier film than ... its own hackneyed premise suggests.
0.4 <|###|> A creaky, lethargic and daft action thriller ...
0.6 <|###|> Many things are blown up, in some style.
0.8 <|###|> Entertaining, pleasingly old-school Arnie action thriller, enlivened by stylish direction, strong performances and some nice ideas.
0.45 <|###|> Cool to see Arnold back. I just wish the movie was a little better.
0.4 <|###|> Where the film could have been self-aware and a little cleverer for it, director Jee-woon Kim misses a trick by sticking to the action formula.
0.625 <|###|> That Second Amendment sure kicks ass.
0.6 <|###|> This has its moments - what Scorsese film does not? -- but over a two-and-a-half-hour stretch it huffs and puffs and still doesn't blow the house down.
0.875 <|###|> There's a lot of tough talk from tough men in this testosterone-fueled thriller, as the thin blue line disintegrates amid gritty give-and-take in William Monahan's excellent script.
0.9 <|###|> The Departed is a near-perfect synthesis of cinematic genius and commercial appeal, quite possibly the most accomplished and accessible film from one of the greatest living directors.
0.8 <|###|> Bloody, brutal and brilliant -- DiCaprio and Nicholson shine in the crime movie of 2006.
0.9 <|###|> The shocking violence is well-placed. The action scenes are always comprehensible -- no jump cut cheats here -- and the suspense will make you fidget in your seat. What a corker.
1.0 <|###|> The best of its kind since Michael Mann's Heat.
0.8 <|###|> This is rich and satisfying stuff with Scorsese rediscovering his masterful skill at delivering a narrative which crackles with acid dialogue delivered by a gifted cast.
0.6 <|###|> As ingenious as it is artificial.
0.8 <|###|> Nicholson's unsavoury grin and seedy menace are a joy to behold.
1.0 <|###|> Rude, profane, clever, hilarious, engrossing, crowd-pleasing, ridiculously entertaining.
0.8 <|###|> As cop thrillers go, this is the best in quite a while.
0.5 <|###|> I think GoodFellas leaves this for dead, absolutely for dead.
1.0 <|###|> The Departed is not for the faint of heart. But scaredy-cats are going to miss a tremendously satisfying film, one that will have you leaving the theater saying, "Now, that was a movie."
0.8 <|###|> It all makes for extremely watchable entertainment.
0.8 <|###|> This is Scorsese's Serpico, his French Connection, his Heat, and he brings the same eye for anthropological detail to the boys in blue as he does to his beloved wiseguys.
0.8 <|###|> Scorsese finds himself back in his comfort zone with a crime epic about loyalty and deception that's deeply engaging and viciously entertaining from start to bloody finish.
0.9 <|###|> Urban film making at its best, The Departed is a brutally violent, beautifully crafted, and incredibly well acted piece of film making that will leave you reeling.
0.59 <|###|> The film is superbly shot, and the rapid-fire editing and shaky camera fit the constant flux that the main characters find themselves in time and again.
0.6 <|###|> Much splat, little art
0.75 <|###|> Scorsese isn't about plots; he's about people, places, and times, and until he departs from that, this film is a return to genius.
0.8 <|###|> One of the year's very best and most exciting films.
0.9 <|###|> The Departed heralds Martin Scorsese's return to the top of his game and simultaneously secures for the film a place in the pantheon of the very best of American crime cinema. Welcome back to Scorsese's mean streets.
0.4 <|###|> Scorsese revisits old territory in The Departed, and he doesn't do anything he hasn't done brilliantly several times before.
0.875 <|###|> Probably the director's most taut piece of storytelling since Goodfellas.
1.0 <|###|> What makes this a Scorsese film, and not merely a retread, is the director's use of actors, locations and energy, and its buried theme. I am fond of saying that a movie is not about what it's about; it's about how it's about it.
0.75 <|###|> Director To doesn't sacrifice substance to style. The over-the-top violent flourishes, more psychological than paint-the-screen-red literal, will burrow under your skin.
0.6 <|###|> Whatever he lacks in narrative drive, To is still the master of style.
0.8 <|###|> The exposition is perfectly balanced with bloody action and muscular set-pieces.
0.875 <|###|> The film's violence erupts in rare, staccato bursts, all the more horrifying for coming out of nowhere.
0.6 <|###|> If it is too stylistically modest to win converts among the multiplex crowd, the film surely rewards followers of the genre.
0.875 <|###|> If Machiavelli's The Prince and Sun Tzu's The Art of War translate to other centuries and cultures, so might Election and Triad Election.
0.75 <|###|> [Director To's] talent for documentary-style realism and navigating complex political systems sets him apart, though his nationalism puts him squarely in the mainstream.
0.5 <|###|> The moviea(TM)s most powerful component is political.
0.75 <|###|> This remains a well-crafted genre movie, and one that promises further developments in its final scene.
0.625 <|###|> Like the late John Frankenheimer, director To marries his drama with action and superb composition to achieve compelling results at times.
0.875 <|###|> Into a season of Hollywood blockbusters, this import arrives with the impact of a high-velocity bullet.
0.8 <|###|> Like any good sequel, this film takes what is familiar with the original's concept -- in this case, an internecine struggle for supremacy -- and deepens it.
0.625 <|###|> Triad Election is slow-burning and sedate, even dull in stretches. But it deserves credit for presenting such a courageous critique of the Chinese system, which combines the worst aspects of official corruption and mob lawlessness.
0.625 <|###|> Like many Hong Kong mob movies, Triad Election</i is not about fleshed-out characters or intricate stories. It's a blunt, grimly efficient action movie that underlines the lies gangsters tell themselves so they, at least, can believe they're good guys.
0.875 <|###|> Johnny To's superb, graceful new Triad Election actually has quite a bit in common with Francis Coppola's Godfather trilogy.
0.8333333333333334 <|###|> The director rejuvenates the genre by connecting the dots between a criminal subculture and a much bigger sociological picture. He's finally given HK cinema its very own Godfather.
0.75 <|###|> Two screenwriters were responsible for this fascinating look at organized crime in China, as well as the continuing governmental policies that make the triads thrive.
0.875 <|###|> Comparisons to The Godfather Part II are inevitable. For a change, such comparisons are also favorable.
0.8 <|###|> Guided by To's elegant camera moves, less visceral than most Hong Kong filmmakers, the Election movies put a fresh, intriguing spin on the usual cinematic gangster motifs.
0.75 <|###|> Ready for The Godfather with a distinctly Hong Kong flavor?
0.75 <|###|> Plenty of films owe a debt to The Godfather, but it's rare to see inspiration used as successfully as it is here.
0.8 <|###|> expertly captures the battle between old-school gangster pathology and the new cutthroat tactics of the corporate criminal
0.75 <|###|> The parallels to all three Godfather films are there, if you care to look, but the Election films have other pleasures.
0.9 <|###|> The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller Triad Election as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier.
1.0 <|###|> Maybe you don't know much about this director. But if you like Hong Kong action movies where everyone's constantly killing each other in a ballet of bullets (and other weapons), then [Johnny To] is your new Francis Ford Coppola.
0.875 <|###|> This disturbing social order, both inside and outside the Triad, is the series' defining characteristic. Because of its emphasis, this installment satisfies, even if another sequel feels inevitable.
0.625 <|###|> Election 2 is equal in precision to its predecessor, exuding a perpetual sense of danger.
0.625 <|###|> It's not to say there's not a lot wrong with the film, but rather to suggest that the chief criticisms of it being strange and "a mess" aren't among them.
0.6 <|###|> An often fascinating mess, but a mess all the same.
0.25 <|###|> There's the obese Brando pretending to be God while dressed in gauzy white robes like a demented pope
0.8 <|###|> Amazingly, Kilmer delivers an odder performance than Brando. Creepy retelling.
0.5 <|###|> In its final third, the movie goes to hell in more ways than Frankenheimer intended.
0.625 <|###|> The most exciting characters are killed off too early, and what we're left with is a Satan's "Seasme Street."
0.2 <|###|> I'm sure it looked good on paper. That and Kilmer's frighteningly apt mimicry of Brando's voice are about the only positive things I can say.
0.5 <|###|> The movie keeps switching focus without ever getting its bearings, and when Brando exits earlier than expected, there's little but mayhem to fall back on.
0.8 <|###|> Uneven; definitely has its moments.
0.2 <|###|> Things are so cheap they didn't even spring for uniforms for the so-called cops; everybody seems to be wearing their street clothes.
0.9 <|###|> One of the best horror-thrillers of the classic era, and a massively inspirational piece of cinema.
0.8 <|###|> ...[a] demonic clockwork thriller.
0.875 <|###|> With barely any music, Clouzot unfolds the action with precision timing and suspense, culminating in one of the cinema's first and most memorable twist endings ever.
1.0 <|###|> set the bar high in terms of both its murderous, yet sympathetic characters and its tense scenario that mixes the conventional thriller elements of lust, jealousy, and homicide with the possibility of supernatural horror
0.8 <|###|> Still riveting stuff, beautifully acted out by Simone Signoret and Vera Clouzot, the director's wife.
1.0 <|###|> It's a diabolical masterpiece.
1.0 <|###|> Satisfying, elegant and nasty.
1.0 <|###|> This is a masterpiece that easily matches the best of Hitchcock.
1.0 <|###|> The ending, much copied, is justly famous. But it's the implacable build-up that seals its classic status...
1.0 <|###|> Delectable suspense with a grand payoff.
1.0 <|###|> First-class all the way (unlike the Sharon Stone remake)
0.86 <|###|> Avoids formulas, instead opting to take the audience down the same windy, confusing roads that the characters travel.
0.9 <|###|> A bitter chiller. One of the most suspenseful films ever made.
0.75 <|###|> ...[contains] some incredibly satisfying moments and a twist ending that's almost impossible to guess.
1.0 <|###|> This is one of the dandiest mystery dramas that has shown here in goodness knows when.
0.8 <|###|> One of the scariest moments ever.
0.8 <|###|> Everything that you need from a suspense thriller.
0.625 <|###|> It has the look and feel of one of the original Hitchcock movies from the 30s.
0.85 <|###|> A scary movie in the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, and while it isn't as well known, it's just as chilling.
0.875 <|###|> [Creates] a diabolical double-reverse plot that keeps the audience guessing right up to the thoroughly implausible final scene.
1.0 <|###|> With a deliciously curvy and complex plot, Diabolique is a masterpiece of suspense -- as accomplished as anything done by Hitchcock.
0.65 <|###|> As an historical reenactment it suffers from a great deal of simplification in order to make complex events quickly and easily understandable, and as a drama it suffers from a great deal of build that never really pays on it's promise.
0.5 <|###|> While the performances keep the film afloat, Kapur's over indulgent direction and his inadequate interpretation of history comes dangerously close to running it aground.
0.4 <|###|> odaje sve nedostatke i ograni%u010Denja olovnih vremena u kojima je nastao
0.8 <|###|> Every shot, every costume is decadent with color, and every single twitch of Blanchett's face is imbued with meaning as she negotiates her way through her warring roles of being a woman and being a queen.
0.4 <|###|> But saddled with this dopey script, [Blanchett] is stuck pulling a series of poses and wearing one ornate gown after another.
0.625 <|###|> Blanchett is again director Shekhar Kapur's greatest asset. His weakness is his tendency to fall back on silly, melodramatic contrivance better suited to popcorn fare than to a believable meditation on Elizabethan England.
0.8 <|###|> Betrayal, war, love triangles and most importantly, Cate Blanchett proves to be able to capture strength, anger and sadness better...
0.6 <|###|> This is an epic, to be sure, but it is also a melodrama, a soap opera of titanic scale and bluster.
0.2 <|###|> Figurinos, direcao de arte e fotografia sao exuberantes, mas fica ate dificil apreciar a performance de Cate Blanchett em meio a um roteiro tao estupido e a direcao "olhem-pra-mim-sou-Cecil-B.-DeMille!" de Shekhar Kapur.
0.4 <|###|> Menos interesante y mas rutinaria que la primera Elizabeth (de 1998), esta segunda parte vale la pena mas que nada por otra brillante composicion de Cate Blanchett.
0.4 <|###|> a muddle that subsumes [its] premise in a mighty attempt to be several things all at once, with an uneven delivery
0.625 <|###|> ... fearsome and passionate with its visual flair, but incredibly confused as to how it wants to address Elizabeth's life beyond what has already been realized.
0.8 <|###|> "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" is a worthy sequel to "Elizabeth". Cate Blanchett delivers the same performance that earned her so much praise the first time around. The epic feel harkens back to Hollywood's Golden Age.
0.5 <|###|> The elaborate costumes and set decoration provide the only interest.
0.5 <|###|> Unreliable as history and misguided as a contemporary allegory, Golden Age finally fails because it is a half-hearted spectacle, not even filmed in a widescreen format.
0.6 <|###|> Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth sequel is a beautifully shot, impeccably designed and largely entertaining drama, providing you're not a stickler for historical accuracy.
0.8 <|###|> If this is a film that irritates nearly as much as it pleases, we do get a sense of the times, and of the lady in question. The eyes, if not the brain, are certainly given a workout that they will remember.
0.6 <|###|> See it anyway for Blanchett's soulful modulation between queenly command and womanly anguish.
0.2 <|###|> Where Kapur's first Elizabeth was cool, cerebral, fascinatingly concerned with complex plotting, the new movie is pitched at the level of a Jean Plaidy romantic novel.
0.8 <|###|> Rich in colour, sumptuous costumes, political intrigues and the personal relationships which dominate Elizabeth once more.
0.6 <|###|> Kapur's film is visually arresting, each frame a work of art in miniature. But there is something rather breathless about the storytelling.
0.6 <|###|> Despite all that's going for it, you can't help thinking this movie could have been so much better.
0.5 <|###|> A handsome but shallow sequel.
0.4 <|###|> The film is just about worth seeing for the wigs and costumes. But Elizabeth: The Golden Age sank without trace in American cinemas, and I fear it will do the same here.
0.6 <|###|> A lesser movie compared to its 1998 predecessor, this sequel nonetheless delivers the sort of stirring drama and sweeping spectacle its subject demands. Blanchett, meanwhile, shines brightly enough in the title role to make Elizabeth III a certainty.
0.3333333333333333 <|###|> Making soap of statecraft, the film has plenty of juicy moments, but offers an inconsistent rather than complex view of Elizabeth.
0.6 <|###|> Sidelines Sir Francis Drake in favour of the dashing Raleigh, nicely summing up the film: all flash, very little bang.
0.6 <|###|> Over-indulgent and melodramatic, as is the nature of artistic mythmaking, The Golden Age will beguile and repel in equal measure. The performances are supreme, although some viewers may struggle to reconcile the director's epic intentions.
0.8 <|###|> Even though the script plays fast and loose with historical facts, that indomitable bulldog spirit rings true and holds you captive for the duration.
0.7 <|###|> It's flawed and it does feel longer because the big finale is less like a battle and more like an on-screen version of battleship, but Cate and Clive are still worth a look.
0.4 <|###|> Want to know what a gifted actress Cate Blanchett is? Watch her keep a straight face throughout Elizabeth: The Golden Age.
0.7 <|###|> The film is beautifully shot, filling the screen with brightly saturated hues that give it an almost fairy tale-like visual sense, rather like a series of Pre-Raphaelite paintings brought to life.
0.625 <|###|> okay, but more silver than gold this time out.
0.5 <|###|> The script is the flowery prose of an overly earnest high school student.
0.375 <|###|> The movie contains the usual palace intrigue and overblown dialogue. The only line missing is the one referring to Elizabeth as a "king in petticoats."
0.7 <|###|> Golden Age starts well, and with sharp wit and crisp dialogue. But as the story moves toward the tentative romance with Raleigh, the film drifts into melodrama...
0.75 <|###|> Bigger and more exciting than its intimate predecessor.
0.25 <|###|> Breasts heave and the sea storms as historical music swells in Shekhar Kapur's overwrought follow-up to Elizabeth.
0.3 <|###|> There are movies that are so bad they're good, and then there are movies that are so bad they're completely awesome.
0.75 <|###|> Cate the Great once again imbues the Queen with her captivating mix of steely strength, regal dignity, take-no-crap toughness, and intimate vulnerability.
0.6 <|###|> Girlhouse is just another nudie horror flick at first glance, but a strong finale finishes things off with a bloody, satisfying moneyshot.
0.7 <|###|> Girl House is an impressive first feature for Trevor Matthews. For a slasher film, there is suitable attention to detail and a reputable level of respect for all the characters.
0.25 <|###|> Puts the porn back in "torture porn." Pity the parents of these pretty young actresses.
0.7 <|###|> The air of Gallic nonchalance ensures you have a lot of fun watching Pinon and Ardant match wits. It's Dana, however, who anchors the story.
0.7 <|###|> An engaging, enjoyable slice of suspense from the French.
0.5 <|###|> Is it supposed to be funny, tragic or what? Even the characters don't seem too sure.
0.5 <|###|> Red herrings abound and audience frustration sets in. It's a pity because the film looks good and the Gilbert Becaud songs on the soundtrack are easy on the ear.
0.6 <|###|> It's filled with intriguing characters, it has a fascinating initial premise -- and then it runs off the rails.
0.8 <|###|> The ever-appealing Fanny Ardant and the enigmatic, pug-faced character actor Dominique Pinon have many subtle delights up their sleeves, and newcomer Audrey Dana is a revelation.
0.86 <|###|> ... about the creation of fiction, the way we spin lies together into a simulacrum of life - if there's any philosophical point of view beyond that it's that every narrative is necessarily an abridgment of truth.
0.875 <|###|> What's especially clever about the plotting is that anything that proves to be merely a red herring is then incorporated into another storyline.
0.75 <|###|> If this kind of storytelling is your cup of absinthe, Claude Lelouch makes it easy to sip appreciatively.
0.9 <|###|> In many ways, Lelouch's film is -- in its somewhat old-fashioned way (which isn't a pejorative) -- the most bracing dose of cinema I've seen all year.
0.75 <|###|> Provides one of the year's more memorable movie moments: a simple shot of a barn, overlaid with both the soothing crooning of a Gilbert Becaud pop song and the terrified squeals of a hog being slaughtered.
0.625 <|###|> Even if the game isn't entirely successful, it's fun to play along.
0.75 <|###|> It's intellectually cagey, potentially romantic, and, above all, an entertaining puzzle box of duplicitous people doing mysterious things, men and women.
0.75 <|###|> As fizzy and non-nutritive as a glass of sparkling wine, Roman de Gare is a crowd-pleasing blend of romance, farce and mystery that plays out a little like a Ruth Rendell mystery novel with Rendell herself as the chief suspect.
0.8 <|###|> Forty years after his breakout success as a filmmaker, Claude Lelouch makes something of a comeback with his playful and sexy whodunit, Roman de Gare.
0.6 <|###|> With elements of road movie, thriller and comedy as well as other genres, Tracks possesses a freewheeling appeal.
0.7 <|###|> Entertaining despite nearly fatal plot holes.
0.625 <|###|> I think I understand the alternative realities of the plot, and I concede the loose ends are tied up, sort of, but I didn't care.
0.8 <|###|> Don't go to the theater expecting too much and you can't help but leave with a smile on your face.
0.75 <|###|> Lelouch's deft touch with various cinematic styles, however surface, enables him to interweave pastoral elegy, quirky social comedy and thriller with fluid ease.
0.875 <|###|> An ingenuous knot of plot, expertly tangled, in which nothing is quite what it seems.
0.625 <|###|> Pinon and Dana are so striking together.
0.7 <|###|> Succeeds as a mystery, comedy and romance in unexpected ways.
1.0 <|###|> It's the smartest and best suspense movie you're likely to see for a while.
0.625 <|###|> Thanks to the able cast and crisp cinematography, it's mostly unpretentious and reasonably entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> In quite a balancing act, [Lelouch] has written a script that's a thriller, somber romantic comedy, and, for the first half, a tense road movie.
0.75 <|###|> Lelouch's film is the cinematic equivalent, enjoyable fluff that your mind will discard after the closing credits -- but worth seeing nevertheless.
