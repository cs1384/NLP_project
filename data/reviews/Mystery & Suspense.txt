FAIR Really quite fun. Up to a point.
FAIR The plot may sound fairly simplistic but underneath the blood and guts there's a biting satire about rich cosseted students signing up to causes they hardly understand.
FAIR The Green Inferno receives a palpable shot in the arm from the characters' initial arrival into the tribe's primitive camp...
FAIR A fun and interesting twist on the travelogue sub-genre of horror ... far better than many horror movies with twice the budget.
FAIR A very slow start threatens to derail The Green Inferno, but once the terror begins, it never lets up and Roth once again proves why he's a master of horror.
FAIR if you want an absolutely brutal experience that's tough to endure, just like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, this is probably the movie for you.
FAIR A throwback action movie that invokes 1980s nostalgia in all the right ways.
GOOD The Last Stand is a fast-paced, action-heavy throwback, shot with a fluid visual eye by Kim Jee-Woon. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back and better than ever.
BAD As action movies go, it's okay. There are some good ideas underneath and an attempt develop them, but only an attempt. And though time has moved on, Schwarzenegger himself hasn't. As a hero's triumphal return goes, it's more of a whimper.
FAIR Arnie lurches through the film with a kind of defiant dignity, his signature mixture of self-effacing humour and good ol' tough talk allowing us to buy into the kind of big-screen hero he made us fall in love with all those decades ago.
FAIR Director Jee-woon Kim (I Saw the Devil) knows how to fill up the screen, surround his megastar with economy-sized murders, car chases, billowing blood-clouds and goofiness.
FAIR The film, though underdeveloped, is rife with big guns, flippant one-liners, improbable battles, high-octane car chases and way too much testosterone - all the hallmarks of a classic Schwarzenegger film.
FAIR ...it's refreshing to watch a film that wants to be nothing more than a blood-soaked accompaniment to beer and pizza.
BAD The gimmick of Schwarzenegger's return to cinema wears off quickly. A bland bullet riddled excuse for an action flick.
FAIR The Last Stand sees bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger return to the big screen following an eight-year term as Governor of California, because that is the reality we now occupy... A fun, dumb, enjoyable, dumb, mostly well performed, super dumb film.
BAD Mindless, dumb fun as Arnie grunts a few one liners and tries to terminate an escaped drug lord who's in a fast car and heading for freedom.
FAIR Despite some graphic violence and even though it is really silly, this is an entertaining action film showing that Arnold Schwartzenegger has not lost any of his charm.
BAD Surely the former governor of the state could have come across a better script for his return to the big screen in a starring role.
FAIR No, he doesn't demonstrate a lot of 'Terminator'-style moves.But, hey, he doesn't have to. Schwarzenegger, now in his mid-60s, just needs to tote some weapons, seek revenge and utter a few one-liners, which is exactly what he does in 'The Last Stand.'
BAD Arnie stomps his way through a role in which every punch looks clumsy and every line of dialogue sounds like it has been learnt phonetically.
GOOD "The Last Stand" could be an old episode of "Gunsmoke," with its theme of the law versus the bad guys.
FAIR An entertaining, if not particularly longed for, return for the 65-year-old action icon.
FAIR The results are surprisingly good fun, popcorn-friendly, and awfully redolent of Rio Bravo. Fine by us. He's back, alright.
BAD Korean filmmaker Kim played with the Western genre before in his wacky 2008 pastiche The Good the Bad the Weird, and this film is just as chaotically uneven, mixing cartoon-style silliness with grisly violence.
FAIR There isn't much of a story here, though it's great to see Arnold back where he belongs.
FAIR Satisfied customers may include undiscriminating action fans, Luis Guzman completists and Wayne LaPierre (one bad guy meets his reward when he trespasses on the property of a shotgun-toting granny).
FAIR As comebacks go, Schwarzenegger has chosen a really good vehicle with which to remind people of how he became so popular in the first place.
FAIR If slick nostalgia is what you're after, The Last Stand is for you.
FAIR It's entertaining, if a little (a lot) silly.
FAIR It's good to see Arnie moving back to the kind of public service he does best.
FAIR An action star is (re)born.
FAIR A suitably lightweight comeback for Arnie, The Last Stand does just enough to please his legion of fans, and proves the action icon still has charisma to spare.
FAIR Korean film-maker Kim Jee-woon gives it plenty of directorial welly, and it's good to see a film with cop cars flying through the air.
FAIR Arnold is back as an action hero, and playing someone near his own age. Therefore the movie is more believable and thus more entertaining.
FAIR A zippier, zestier film than ... its own hackneyed premise suggests.
BAD A creaky, lethargic and daft action thriller ...
FAIR Many things are blown up, in some style.
GOOD Entertaining, pleasingly old-school Arnie action thriller, enlivened by stylish direction, strong performances and some nice ideas.
BAD Cool to see Arnold back. I just wish the movie was a little better.
BAD Where the film could have been self-aware and a little cleverer for it, director Jee-woon Kim misses a trick by sticking to the action formula.
FAIR That Second Amendment sure kicks ass.
FAIR This has its moments - what Scorsese film does not? -- but over a two-and-a-half-hour stretch it huffs and puffs and still doesn't blow the house down.
GOOD There's a lot of tough talk from tough men in this testosterone-fueled thriller, as the thin blue line disintegrates amid gritty give-and-take in William Monahan's excellent script.
GOOD The Departed is a near-perfect synthesis of cinematic genius and commercial appeal, quite possibly the most accomplished and accessible film from one of the greatest living directors.
GOOD Bloody, brutal and brilliant -- DiCaprio and Nicholson shine in the crime movie of 2006.
GOOD The shocking violence is well-placed. The action scenes are always comprehensible -- no jump cut cheats here -- and the suspense will make you fidget in your seat. What a corker.
GOOD The best of its kind since Michael Mann's Heat.
GOOD This is rich and satisfying stuff with Scorsese rediscovering his masterful skill at delivering a narrative which crackles with acid dialogue delivered by a gifted cast.
FAIR As ingenious as it is artificial.
GOOD Nicholson's unsavoury grin and seedy menace are a joy to behold.
GOOD Rude, profane, clever, hilarious, engrossing, crowd-pleasing, ridiculously entertaining.
GOOD As cop thrillers go, this is the best in quite a while.
BAD I think GoodFellas leaves this for dead, absolutely for dead.
GOOD The Departed is not for the faint of heart. But scaredy-cats are going to miss a tremendously satisfying film, one that will have you leaving the theater saying, "Now, that was a movie."
GOOD It all makes for extremely watchable entertainment.
GOOD This is Scorsese's Serpico, his French Connection, his Heat, and he brings the same eye for anthropological detail to the boys in blue as he does to his beloved wiseguys.
GOOD Scorsese finds himself back in his comfort zone with a crime epic about loyalty and deception that's deeply engaging and viciously entertaining from start to bloody finish.
GOOD Urban film making at its best, The Departed is a brutally violent, beautifully crafted, and incredibly well acted piece of film making that will leave you reeling.
BAD The film is superbly shot, and the rapid-fire editing and shaky camera fit the constant flux that the main characters find themselves in time and again.
FAIR Much splat, little art
FAIR Scorsese isn't about plots; he's about people, places, and times, and until he departs from that, this film is a return to genius.
GOOD One of the year's very best and most exciting films.
GOOD The Departed heralds Martin Scorsese's return to the top of his game and simultaneously secures for the film a place in the pantheon of the very best of American crime cinema. Welcome back to Scorsese's mean streets.
BAD Scorsese revisits old territory in The Departed, and he doesn't do anything he hasn't done brilliantly several times before.
GOOD Probably the director's most taut piece of storytelling since Goodfellas.
GOOD What makes this a Scorsese film, and not merely a retread, is the director's use of actors, locations and energy, and its buried theme. I am fond of saying that a movie is not about what it's about; it's about how it's about it.
FAIR Director To doesn't sacrifice substance to style. The over-the-top violent flourishes, more psychological than paint-the-screen-red literal, will burrow under your skin.
FAIR Whatever he lacks in narrative drive, To is still the master of style.
GOOD The exposition is perfectly balanced with bloody action and muscular set-pieces.
GOOD The film's violence erupts in rare, staccato bursts, all the more horrifying for coming out of nowhere.
FAIR If it is too stylistically modest to win converts among the multiplex crowd, the film surely rewards followers of the genre.
GOOD If Machiavelli's The Prince and Sun Tzu's The Art of War translate to other centuries and cultures, so might Election and Triad Election.
FAIR [Director To's] talent for documentary-style realism and navigating complex political systems sets him apart, though his nationalism puts him squarely in the mainstream.
BAD The moviea(TM)s most powerful component is political.
FAIR This remains a well-crafted genre movie, and one that promises further developments in its final scene.
FAIR Like the late John Frankenheimer, director To marries his drama with action and superb composition to achieve compelling results at times.
GOOD Into a season of Hollywood blockbusters, this import arrives with the impact of a high-velocity bullet.
GOOD Like any good sequel, this film takes what is familiar with the original's concept -- in this case, an internecine struggle for supremacy -- and deepens it.
FAIR Triad Election is slow-burning and sedate, even dull in stretches. But it deserves credit for presenting such a courageous critique of the Chinese system, which combines the worst aspects of official corruption and mob lawlessness.
FAIR Like many Hong Kong mob movies, Triad Election</i is not about fleshed-out characters or intricate stories. It's a blunt, grimly efficient action movie that underlines the lies gangsters tell themselves so they, at least, can believe they're good guys.
GOOD Johnny To's superb, graceful new Triad Election actually has quite a bit in common with Francis Coppola's Godfather trilogy.
GOOD The director rejuvenates the genre by connecting the dots between a criminal subculture and a much bigger sociological picture. He's finally given HK cinema its very own Godfather.
FAIR Two screenwriters were responsible for this fascinating look at organized crime in China, as well as the continuing governmental policies that make the triads thrive.
GOOD Comparisons to The Godfather Part II are inevitable. For a change, such comparisons are also favorable.
GOOD Guided by To's elegant camera moves, less visceral than most Hong Kong filmmakers, the Election movies put a fresh, intriguing spin on the usual cinematic gangster motifs.
FAIR Ready for The Godfather with a distinctly Hong Kong flavor?
FAIR Plenty of films owe a debt to The Godfather, but it's rare to see inspiration used as successfully as it is here.
GOOD expertly captures the battle between old-school gangster pathology and the new cutthroat tactics of the corporate criminal
FAIR The parallels to all three Godfather films are there, if you care to look, but the Election films have other pleasures.
GOOD The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller Triad Election as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier.
GOOD Maybe you don't know much about this director. But if you like Hong Kong action movies where everyone's constantly killing each other in a ballet of bullets (and other weapons), then [Johnny To] is your new Francis Ford Coppola.
GOOD This disturbing social order, both inside and outside the Triad, is the series' defining characteristic. Because of its emphasis, this installment satisfies, even if another sequel feels inevitable.
FAIR Election 2 is equal in precision to its predecessor, exuding a perpetual sense of danger.
FAIR It's not to say there's not a lot wrong with the film, but rather to suggest that the chief criticisms of it being strange and "a mess" aren't among them.
FAIR An often fascinating mess, but a mess all the same.
BAD There's the obese Brando pretending to be God while dressed in gauzy white robes like a demented pope
GOOD Amazingly, Kilmer delivers an odder performance than Brando. Creepy retelling.
BAD In its final third, the movie goes to hell in more ways than Frankenheimer intended.
FAIR The most exciting characters are killed off too early, and what we're left with is a Satan's "Seasme Street."
BAD I'm sure it looked good on paper. That and Kilmer's frighteningly apt mimicry of Brando's voice are about the only positive things I can say.
BAD The movie keeps switching focus without ever getting its bearings, and when Brando exits earlier than expected, there's little but mayhem to fall back on.
GOOD Uneven; definitely has its moments.
BAD Things are so cheap they didn't even spring for uniforms for the so-called cops; everybody seems to be wearing their street clothes.
GOOD One of the best horror-thrillers of the classic era, and a massively inspirational piece of cinema.
GOOD ...[a] demonic clockwork thriller.
GOOD With barely any music, Clouzot unfolds the action with precision timing and suspense, culminating in one of the cinema's first and most memorable twist endings ever.
GOOD set the bar high in terms of both its murderous, yet sympathetic characters and its tense scenario that mixes the conventional thriller elements of lust, jealousy, and homicide with the possibility of supernatural horror
GOOD Still riveting stuff, beautifully acted out by Simone Signoret and Vera Clouzot, the director's wife.
GOOD It's a diabolical masterpiece.
GOOD Satisfying, elegant and nasty.
GOOD This is a masterpiece that easily matches the best of Hitchcock.
GOOD The ending, much copied, is justly famous. But it's the implacable build-up that seals its classic status...
GOOD Delectable suspense with a grand payoff.
GOOD First-class all the way (unlike the Sharon Stone remake)
GOOD Avoids formulas, instead opting to take the audience down the same windy, confusing roads that the characters travel.
GOOD A bitter chiller. One of the most suspenseful films ever made.
FAIR ...[contains] some incredibly satisfying moments and a twist ending that's almost impossible to guess.
GOOD This is one of the dandiest mystery dramas that has shown here in goodness knows when.
GOOD One of the scariest moments ever.
GOOD Everything that you need from a suspense thriller.
FAIR It has the look and feel of one of the original Hitchcock movies from the 30s.
GOOD A scary movie in the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, and while it isn't as well known, it's just as chilling.
GOOD [Creates] a diabolical double-reverse plot that keeps the audience guessing right up to the thoroughly implausible final scene.
GOOD With a deliciously curvy and complex plot, Diabolique is a masterpiece of suspense -- as accomplished as anything done by Hitchcock.
FAIR As an historical reenactment it suffers from a great deal of simplification in order to make complex events quickly and easily understandable, and as a drama it suffers from a great deal of build that never really pays on it's promise.
BAD While the performances keep the film afloat, Kapur's over indulgent direction and his inadequate interpretation of history comes dangerously close to running it aground.
BAD odaje sve nedostatke i ograni%u010Denja olovnih vremena u kojima je nastao
GOOD Every shot, every costume is decadent with color, and every single twitch of Blanchett's face is imbued with meaning as she negotiates her way through her warring roles of being a woman and being a queen.
BAD But saddled with this dopey script, [Blanchett] is stuck pulling a series of poses and wearing one ornate gown after another.
FAIR Blanchett is again director Shekhar Kapur's greatest asset. His weakness is his tendency to fall back on silly, melodramatic contrivance better suited to popcorn fare than to a believable meditation on Elizabethan England.
GOOD Betrayal, war, love triangles and most importantly, Cate Blanchett proves to be able to capture strength, anger and sadness better...
FAIR This is an epic, to be sure, but it is also a melodrama, a soap opera of titanic scale and bluster.
BAD Figurinos, direcao de arte e fotografia sao exuberantes, mas fica ate dificil apreciar a performance de Cate Blanchett em meio a um roteiro tao estupido e a direcao "olhem-pra-mim-sou-Cecil-B.-DeMille!" de Shekhar Kapur.
BAD Menos interesante y mas rutinaria que la primera Elizabeth (de 1998), esta segunda parte vale la pena mas que nada por otra brillante composicion de Cate Blanchett.
BAD a muddle that subsumes [its] premise in a mighty attempt to be several things all at once, with an uneven delivery
FAIR ... fearsome and passionate with its visual flair, but incredibly confused as to how it wants to address Elizabeth's life beyond what has already been realized.
GOOD "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" is a worthy sequel to "Elizabeth". Cate Blanchett delivers the same performance that earned her so much praise the first time around. The epic feel harkens back to Hollywood's Golden Age.
BAD The elaborate costumes and set decoration provide the only interest.
BAD Unreliable as history and misguided as a contemporary allegory, Golden Age finally fails because it is a half-hearted spectacle, not even filmed in a widescreen format.
FAIR Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth sequel is a beautifully shot, impeccably designed and largely entertaining drama, providing you're not a stickler for historical accuracy.
GOOD If this is a film that irritates nearly as much as it pleases, we do get a sense of the times, and of the lady in question. The eyes, if not the brain, are certainly given a workout that they will remember.
FAIR See it anyway for Blanchett's soulful modulation between queenly command and womanly anguish.
BAD Where Kapur's first Elizabeth was cool, cerebral, fascinatingly concerned with complex plotting, the new movie is pitched at the level of a Jean Plaidy romantic novel.
GOOD Rich in colour, sumptuous costumes, political intrigues and the personal relationships which dominate Elizabeth once more.
FAIR Kapur's film is visually arresting, each frame a work of art in miniature. But there is something rather breathless about the storytelling.
FAIR Despite all that's going for it, you can't help thinking this movie could have been so much better.
BAD A handsome but shallow sequel.
BAD The film is just about worth seeing for the wigs and costumes. But Elizabeth: The Golden Age sank without trace in American cinemas, and I fear it will do the same here.
FAIR A lesser movie compared to its 1998 predecessor, this sequel nonetheless delivers the sort of stirring drama and sweeping spectacle its subject demands. Blanchett, meanwhile, shines brightly enough in the title role to make Elizabeth III a certainty.
BAD Making soap of statecraft, the film has plenty of juicy moments, but offers an inconsistent rather than complex view of Elizabeth.
FAIR Sidelines Sir Francis Drake in favour of the dashing Raleigh, nicely summing up the film: all flash, very little bang.
FAIR Over-indulgent and melodramatic, as is the nature of artistic mythmaking, The Golden Age will beguile and repel in equal measure. The performances are supreme, although some viewers may struggle to reconcile the director's epic intentions.
GOOD Even though the script plays fast and loose with historical facts, that indomitable bulldog spirit rings true and holds you captive for the duration.
FAIR It's flawed and it does feel longer because the big finale is less like a battle and more like an on-screen version of battleship, but Cate and Clive are still worth a look.
BAD Want to know what a gifted actress Cate Blanchett is? Watch her keep a straight face throughout Elizabeth: The Golden Age.
FAIR The film is beautifully shot, filling the screen with brightly saturated hues that give it an almost fairy tale-like visual sense, rather like a series of Pre-Raphaelite paintings brought to life.
FAIR okay, but more silver than gold this time out.
BAD The script is the flowery prose of an overly earnest high school student.
BAD The movie contains the usual palace intrigue and overblown dialogue. The only line missing is the one referring to Elizabeth as a "king in petticoats."
FAIR Golden Age starts well, and with sharp wit and crisp dialogue. But as the story moves toward the tentative romance with Raleigh, the film drifts into melodrama...
FAIR Bigger and more exciting than its intimate predecessor.
BAD Breasts heave and the sea storms as historical music swells in Shekhar Kapur's overwrought follow-up to Elizabeth.
BAD There are movies that are so bad they're good, and then there are movies that are so bad they're completely awesome.
FAIR Cate the Great once again imbues the Queen with her captivating mix of steely strength, regal dignity, take-no-crap toughness, and intimate vulnerability.
FAIR Girlhouse is just another nudie horror flick at first glance, but a strong finale finishes things off with a bloody, satisfying moneyshot.
FAIR Girl House is an impressive first feature for Trevor Matthews. For a slasher film, there is suitable attention to detail and a reputable level of respect for all the characters.
BAD Puts the porn back in "torture porn." Pity the parents of these pretty young actresses.
FAIR The air of Gallic nonchalance ensures you have a lot of fun watching Pinon and Ardant match wits. It's Dana, however, who anchors the story.
FAIR An engaging, enjoyable slice of suspense from the French.
BAD Is it supposed to be funny, tragic or what? Even the characters don't seem too sure.
BAD Red herrings abound and audience frustration sets in. It's a pity because the film looks good and the Gilbert Becaud songs on the soundtrack are easy on the ear.
FAIR It's filled with intriguing characters, it has a fascinating initial premise -- and then it runs off the rails.
GOOD The ever-appealing Fanny Ardant and the enigmatic, pug-faced character actor Dominique Pinon have many subtle delights up their sleeves, and newcomer Audrey Dana is a revelation.
GOOD ... about the creation of fiction, the way we spin lies together into a simulacrum of life - if there's any philosophical point of view beyond that it's that every narrative is necessarily an abridgment of truth.
GOOD What's especially clever about the plotting is that anything that proves to be merely a red herring is then incorporated into another storyline.
FAIR If this kind of storytelling is your cup of absinthe, Claude Lelouch makes it easy to sip appreciatively.
GOOD In many ways, Lelouch's film is -- in its somewhat old-fashioned way (which isn't a pejorative) -- the most bracing dose of cinema I've seen all year.
FAIR Provides one of the year's more memorable movie moments: a simple shot of a barn, overlaid with both the soothing crooning of a Gilbert Becaud pop song and the terrified squeals of a hog being slaughtered.
FAIR Even if the game isn't entirely successful, it's fun to play along.
FAIR It's intellectually cagey, potentially romantic, and, above all, an entertaining puzzle box of duplicitous people doing mysterious things, men and women.
FAIR As fizzy and non-nutritive as a glass of sparkling wine, Roman de Gare is a crowd-pleasing blend of romance, farce and mystery that plays out a little like a Ruth Rendell mystery novel with Rendell herself as the chief suspect.
GOOD Forty years after his breakout success as a filmmaker, Claude Lelouch makes something of a comeback with his playful and sexy whodunit, Roman de Gare.
FAIR With elements of road movie, thriller and comedy as well as other genres, Tracks possesses a freewheeling appeal.
FAIR Entertaining despite nearly fatal plot holes.
FAIR I think I understand the alternative realities of the plot, and I concede the loose ends are tied up, sort of, but I didn't care.
GOOD Don't go to the theater expecting too much and you can't help but leave with a smile on your face.
FAIR Lelouch's deft touch with various cinematic styles, however surface, enables him to interweave pastoral elegy, quirky social comedy and thriller with fluid ease.
GOOD An ingenuous knot of plot, expertly tangled, in which nothing is quite what it seems.
FAIR Pinon and Dana are so striking together.
FAIR Succeeds as a mystery, comedy and romance in unexpected ways.
GOOD It's the smartest and best suspense movie you're likely to see for a while.
FAIR Thanks to the able cast and crisp cinematography, it's mostly unpretentious and reasonably entertaining.
FAIR In quite a balancing act, [Lelouch] has written a script that's a thriller, somber romantic comedy, and, for the first half, a tense road movie.
FAIR Lelouch's film is the cinematic equivalent, enjoyable fluff that your mind will discard after the closing credits -- but worth seeing nevertheless.
FAIR A very interesting experiment that combines moments of mad brilliance with outbreaks of pretentious tedium in about equal measure.
GOOD A savage attack on American comfort.
GOOD functions equally well as revenge drama, moral fable, and no-holds-barred condemnation of dog-eat-dog capitalism
FAIR Dassin's film emerges as a rather searing, wide-reaching indictment of the necessary evils of doing business in the United States
GOOD Dassin swathes Thieves' Highway's long-haul boys in claustrophobic compositions and menacing darkness.
FAIR Late Phases is a fun werewolf flick with a sweet, climactic last stand.
BAD Damici gives his memorable protagonist enough life to hold it together more often than it would have otherwise. He's great here. The movie around him, not so much.
BAD Late Phases transforms from laughably non-frightening horror film to self-serious family drama and back again, all the while remaining ferociously, ravenously boring.
FAIR Adrian Garcia Bogliano ends up merely toying with the death-steeped concerns of his characters, and taking the furious and bitter perspective that powers the narrative's ponderous dramatic core for granted.
FAIR Lots of fun....sexy, slick and surprisingly novel
BAD Torturous vampire bloodbath is a waste for all.
BAD A tedious Blade rip-off. No suspense or scares, but lots of boredom.
BAD While Rise: Blood Hunter isn't a terrible film, it's a predictable one.
FAIR far from perfect, but it's better than most direct-to-video horror you'll find out there. Heck, it's better than some of the theatrical releases we've seen this year
FAIR ...a far more effective piece of work than one might've expected...
BAD It's a blood-red affair thrown together in a dash, a little number that will ultimately get the same kind of treatment from audiences as it did from those who made it: something you might cue up in the DVD player on a whim and forget just as easily.
BAD A dry and dreary little affair, one that's almost shamefully beholden to B-flicks that are a lot more energetic and a lot less intent on being taken so seriously.
BAD Many scenes are set in dark parking lots and dirty city streets, but you sense the locations were chosen because they were inexpensive. There is some pleasure to be had counting continuity mistakes.
FAIR [Director] Gutierrez sustains a heightened mood of sex and violence that, without breaking new ground, entertains in the way Gothic flicks do: a combination of cheap thrills and a good old-fashioned crusade against evil.
FAIR You can thank a capable cast led by the estimable Lucy Liu, and work by writer/director Sebastian Gutierrez that succeeds in making the formulaic seem fresh.
BAD There are worse things than waking up in a morgue. Like, say, waking up and realizing there's another hour of Rise: Blood Hunter to go.
FAIR Harris and Phifer's chemistry lends the inevitable tragedies some genuine punch.
GOOD "Paid In Full" is not the kind of movie that George W. Bush will ever see.
FAIR Stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation.
FAIR For a rapsploitation film to target and frown upon the darker forces of its nature is certainly a good sign for the maturation of the genre.
BAD The story is familiar from its many predecessors; like them, it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay.
FAIR If you saw it on TV, you'd probably turn it off, convinced that you had already seen that movie.
FAIR This familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences, though it's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times.
BAD Harris is supposed to be the star of the story, but comes across as pretty dull and wooden.
BAD A standard, run-of-the-mill drug drama.
BAD Needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance.
BAD Bottom-rung New Jack City wannabe.
FAIR Rings true, from the smooth dialogue to the unaffected performances of the central actors.
FAIR The movie is ambitious, has good energy and is well-acted, but tells a familiar story in a familiar way.
BAD In this bird's-eye-view of the drug trade circa 1986, there's something missing: the buyers.
BAD A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood, this movie strives to be more, but doesn't quite get there. Good performances keep it from being a total rehash.
FAIR Bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness.
FAIR Instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western, it's an unpretentious, sociologically pointed slice of life.
FAIR Suffers from a flat script and a low budget.
BAD It's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick.
FAIR An intelligent crime drama, not because of the criminal activity it dramatizes but because of its powerful examination of the forces that drive criminals.
FAIR Though filmed partly in Canada, Paid in Full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the Reagan years.
FAIR It's good, hard-edged stuff, violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done, morally alert and street-smart.
FAIR ...does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters' choices, good and ill, that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought.
FAIR Paid in Full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of Goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks.
FAIR Uneven script, but strong performances by a powerhouse cast.
FAIR A strained but nevertheless involving little personal drama about a delinquent's alleged murderous deed. Schroeder's suspense piece is arbitrary but satisfying thanks to the reliable leads.
BAD Despite Meryl Streep, Liam Neeson and the usually estimable Edward Furlong, this nonevent huffs and puffs to attain even the level of an ordinary motion picture.
BAD fares poorly when constrained to the screen
BAD Let's hope Richard Gere never has to make another one this cheesy after his comeback in "Arbitrage."
FAIR I may have seen some things coming in the story, but it was nonetheless interesting to watch things play out.
FAIR You have to admire Brandt and Haas for taking such a gamble, but unfortunately it doesn't quite pay off.
FAIR It is a flawed film, but one that accomplishes what it sets out to do: entertain, if in fits and starts, for an hour and a half.
BAD the ineffectiveness of the final half hour ultimately ensures that The Double ends on a disappointingly anticlimactic note.
FAIR The type of professionally assembled star programmer a big studio would once release wide to a decent return in an off-peak season.
BAD With nothing resembling a character worth rooting for, the fact that the plot of The Double just gets sillier and sillier makes it one of the most annoying films of the year.
BAD Brandt's thriller doesn't have much of a connection to the present, let alone reality.
BAD Questionable motives and unbelievable decisions are relatively small potatoes compared with the Sputnik-size plotholes.
BAD Like a stripper who gets naked too quickly, the lukewarm spy thriller "The Double" lays out its big plot twist early in the movie - and soon finds, shivering, that it has nowhere else to go.
FAIR The title "The Double" doesn't refer to baseball, but it could. The thriller may not hit it out of the park, but it's a solid double.
BAD When the story starts to fall apart you're left wondering if the film was worth all the money and effort that went into making it.
BAD It's simply not very good.
BAD Here is a movie constructed from basic parts at the Used Screenplay Store, with a character plugged in whenever one is required.
BAD Generic, formulaic fumble, misjudging its revelations and overestimating their impact.
BAD Not only does The Double's outdated theme feel out of leftfield, it's unexplained and without reason.
BAD It soon devolves into a mess of slit throats and competing motives. Everyone, it seems, has a plot - except the screenwriters.
BAD What can you say about a dull spy thriller that gives away its big "secret'' both in its trailer and the film's title?
BAD If these characters ever had a motivation for their extreme behavior, it disappeared in rewrites.
BAD A tedious, impenetrable cat-and-mouse game involving Russian double and triple agents.
BAD There's a sanded-off, textbook creativity to "The Double" that forsakes rich cloak-and-dagger textures for generic twists, hackneyed flashbacks and telegraphed moments of peril.
BAD Despite similarities, this film is several rungs down the ladder from Salt and lacks the charisma of a lead like Angelina Jolie to pull you past nagging silliness.
BAD Movie packaging at its worst.
BAD ...hopelessly silly.
BAD Like a Training Day for spy thrillers, The Double provocatively pairs Gere and Grace as a gray-green odd couple, only to unravel as the double-crossed absurdities pile up and the duo start trading bad Russian accents in a private Mexican standoff.
BAD Rarely has Mr. Gere walked through any movie with so little energy and so much indifference.
BAD Too silly to be confusing and too flaccid to reach potboiler status, the convoluted spy-thriller The Double is a tossed-off theatrical release that lands with a resounding thud.
FAIR What Van Sant's film does, tremendously well, is make the material foreign again.
BAD Psycho doesn't do much for Van Sant, and he doesn't do much for Psycho.
BAD Vaughn's Norman Bates is much inferior because he lacks the natural neurosis of Anthony Perkins.
BAD The movie doesn't stink. The performances are good, potentially great, especially Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates, but he owns a scene just for doing that psychotic giggle of his.
BAD Personally, I found the remake weaker than the original (which was only vaguely interesting anyway; then again, it's pretty much the same movie).
BAD franky it sucks
FAIR Gus Vant Sant has remade Alfred Hitchcock's classic slasher film with so much reverence and so little originality that it is not clear what the point is.
FAIR It's surprising to note that this film, mostly well-acted, is somewhat lacking on the technical side, which is what Hollywood usually does best these days.
FAIR Predictably, it's (almost) the exact same film, but I wouldn't say that it's a pointless enterprise.
BAD It's not so much that this movie didn't need to be made. The real tragedy is that a group of enormously talented people wasted several months of their lives when together they could have done something fresh and exciting and original.
FAIR Gus Van Sant assumiu um trabalho ingrato: quando as cenas funcionam, em seu filme, a responsabilidade e de Hitchcock. Quando falham, a culpa e sua.
BAD An utterly empty technical achievement.
FAIR What scared audiences then will almost certainly strike kids raised on the unholy trinity of Michael, Jason and Freddy as quaint and slow.
BAD Van Sant's pseudo-Xerox is flat, mannered and often downright boring!
BAD Es mejor que las nuevas generaciones vayan a la tienda de videos y renten la version original
BAD Vince Vaughn is probably the best person you can get to fill Anthony Perkins' shoes; he can be one of America's best film stars one day, and that is evident in the way he treats his character on screen.
BAD Whereas the original was fascinating and shocking, the reconstruction is bland and lifeless.
BAD Vince Vaughn's Norman Bates is about as terrifying as a tranquilized dachshund.
FAIR Less a remake and more a scene-by-scene reconstruction, with all of the original dialogue intact.
BAD It is only because of a few elements of original creativity that Van Sant and the rest should be saved from eternal film damnation.
FAIR This gutsy cinematic experiment is more than just a curiosity. It's an intelligent homage (at times even a spoof) and still a bit of a hand-wringer, even though pop culture has spoiled all the surprises.
BAD Having all of this distinctly '60s material played out by '90s performers in living color makes for a film that feels jarringly anachronistic...
GOOD Is this film better than the original? The answer is no, not quite, but to my shock, it is just about as good of a remake as could have possibly been expected.
FAIR There's nothing exactly wrong with Vaughn's performance, which is edgy and scary. Vaughn simply can't help the fact that physically, he is completely wrong for the role.
GOOD Vaughn, from the outset, seems like a loose cannon, a nut case, a psycho. Unlike Anthony Perkins who, at first, appeared as a shy mama's boy, Vaughn adds an extra layer of menace to his Norman that renders Van Sant's film a bit a-kilter.
FAIR The one actor who stood out from the pack was definitely the rising star of the year, Vince Vaughn, who took Anthony Perkins' superb original performance, and added his own macabre touch of surrealism.
FAIR Vaughn and Heche bring energy and freshness to the parts originated by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. Heche is so good, in fact, and so frisky and watchable in her role, that after her grisly demise in the shower you miss her for a long time.
FAIR Though some hard-core fans of the original may scoff at anything that tries to compete, Van Sant's version of Psycho is actually pretty good.
FAIR Since this is a virtual shot-by-shot, line-by-line remake of the original masterpiece, it's like watching a new version of a Shakespeare play. Think about it.
FAIR not mean to be taken seriously
BAD [The characters] aren't people; they're mere objects to stick in front of the flowing lava.
BAD Movie bombs L.A. with lava, audience with stupidity
BAD The special effects are impressive and the acting by Jones and Heche is good, although their roles didn't require much skill or inspiration.
FAIR The film, about a volcano erupting in downtown Los Angeles, is helped immeasurably by veteran actor Tommy Lee Jones, who has enough charm and charisma to rescue just about any movie. He needs it all to save this one.
FAIR On its own escapist terms, Volcano dishes up a textbook serving of low-I.Q., high-energy entertainment.
FAIR The action, the effects and tough-as-nails Tommy Lee provide a worthwhile thrill ride -- even if the last drop wasn't as big as you thought it would be.
FAIR gives us the bare minimums needed for a story and then lets the lava flow
FAIR The coast may be toast, but it's the lava, covering everything like a malevolent tide of melted butter, that makes this a disaster picture that's tastier than usual.
BAD There's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone.
BAD I don't want to pay $7.50 to watch a movie imitate CNN.
BAD Oh, there's nothing like a natural disaster to bring people together!
BAD Hundreds of screen technicians obviously slaved on the effects -- and for what? A dopey subplot about a bogus arrest. Soap opera involving Jones' injured daughter.
BAD Volcano is an embarrassment, albeit one of the so-bad-it's-kinda-good variety.
GOOD These things can be done well or badly, and Volcano goes full steam ahead.
FAIR More about spectacle than suspense, a very impressive production which is easier to enjoy from a detached distance than it is to get caught up in.
BAD Like the substantially better Twister, this film insists on a thunderous, exhausting pace that inevitably becomes deflating.
BAD Volcano is an absolutely standard, assembly-line undertaking; no wonder one of the extras is reading a paperback titled "Screenwriting Made Easy."
BAD A ridiculous script and mediocre special effects mar this ludicrous disaster pic.
FAIR Memorable? Hardly, but the main actors are worth seeing, and that first act has so much promise it almost makes you want to forgive them for blowing the second.
FAIR This is one of the best pure disaster movies ever made (not that it has much competition). Congratulations to director Mick Jackson for a job well done.
BAD A host of characters is introduced in the opening scenes, but Volcano doesn't know what to do with them. It can't make us care.
FAIR The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest doesn't exactly give the Millennium trilogy the explosive send-off it deserves, and stacked against the other two movies in the series, it's perhaps the weakest story of the three.
GOOD This film ends up being more of a courtroom drama, and yet it's almost as equally thrilling as the first film in the series.
FAIR Unlike its two predecessors, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest boasts a briskly-paced opening half hour that proves effective at immediately drawing the viewer into the movie...
FAIR For me the most deadening aspect of these films is the presence of Michael Nykvist as Blomqvist; he seems to have a personality by-pass, and remains expressionless at all times, no matter what's going on.
BAD The best thing that can be said about the excruciatingly dull, badly made closing chapter in this punishingly bad Swedish crime trilogy is that it really whets the appetite for the upcoming American version.
GOOD Seeing the first two films -- The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played with Fire -- will make the third film more satisfying.
BAD Lisbeth Salander, played by Noomi Rapace, spends most of the story constrained -- first in the hospital, then in prison. What fun is that?
BAD The third and final entry in Stieg Larsson's enormously successful series is perhaps the least thrilling, but it's easily the most satisfying.
GOOD Finale of dark subtitled Swedish trilogy still very violent.
FAIR Semi-satisfying, if you can keep up.
GOOD The gap between this and Dragon Tattoo is pretty big -- this won't be on my '10 Best' list and Tattoo might -- but as the rest of the story, it does nicely.
FAIR While the events are fascinating and entertaining, the film itself is less emotionally involving or viscerally thrilling.
BAD Much of it still plays like bad Thomas Harris...
GOOD A pick-up after the second film, if not as assured as the first. Rapace sets a high watermark for Rooney Mara in David Fincher's remakes.
BAD One final course of Europudding that may leave audiences feeling less satisfied than simply tired and bloated.
BAD A more apt title would be 'The Girl Who Sat Quietly in a Dimly Lit Room'.
BAD This is the most disappointing end to a trilogy since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3.
FAIR Anyone who has invested in the trilogy will savour the mixture of dread and anticipation as the cat-and-mouse game reaches a stirring conclusion.
BAD A bunch of evil old men get their comeuppance in 'The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,' but the girl who messes with their nest does hardly anything at all.
BAD The third and worst of Stieg Larsson's trilogy is poorly directed, under-energised and unthrilling.
GOOD A compelling mix of 70s-style conspiracy thriller, courtroom procedural and psychological drama...
GOOD The powerful performances by the leads, unobtrusive direction that is exemplified in a beguiling courtroom clash, and Larsson's deftly interwoven fabric of treachery and compassion all ensure that we are left yearning for more.
BAD As well as being conventional, The Girl Who Kicked is also confusing, dull and grubby (do we really need to see examples from a child-porn site?).
BAD Is the Millennium Trilogy over? Can we go home?
BAD The Girl Who Makes Us Wish We Were Anywhere Else.
FAIR The final film based on Stieg Larsson's bestselling thriller trilogy opens with a whimper but ends with a bang.
GOOD As ever, Rapace steals every scene she's in, maintaining Lisbeth's moody enigma whether she's lying on her sick bed, making a memorable court entrance in full punk regalia, or taking care of family business.
FAIR This remains watchable thanks to Nyqvist and Rapace but the lacklustre direction, lack of pace and bloated script ensure that it's closer to the mediocre nature of the second film than the brilliance of the first.
GOOD ...could be read as the passion of Lisbeth Salander, as she undergoes a kind of secular crucifixion at the hands of the Swedish establishment ...
FAIR It's enough to see Rapace's Salander smile, however tentatively, however briefly, however unlikely. Those white teeth framed by black-on-black everything? They bite.
FAIR The series is quite satisfying as a whole, in the manner of the type of well-made, limited-episode crime program that might appear on AMC or HBO.
BAD The Matrix: Revolutions of the Millennium Trilogy.
BAD While Rapace remains a strong and captivating actress in the title role, the film is remarkably bad. In fact, it's easily one of the year's worst movies. Boring beyond belief.
BAD The Millennium Trilogy follows a similar pattern as The Matrix Trilogy, and that's not a compliment.
FAIR The European equivalent of The Matrix Revolutions, this third chapter finds a once-vibrant saga largely coasting on the fumes of its well-regarded predecessors.
BAD When your series' most compelling character remains mute and largely on the periphery of the action (albeit all decked out in punker regalia, including a big Mohawk), something is seriously amiss.
FAIR This 148-minute movie is best appreciated if you have already watched the first two movies or read the books. It is not intended to be a standalone film. Neophytes will find themselves lost and confused without sufficient background to fully appreciate...
GOOD Convoluted but absorbing.
GOOD A thoroughly enjoyable murder mystery in the classic style.
BAD Unbelievably lazy.
BAD By the end of Gone you'll be convinced that it's just a low-rent reworking of The Silence of the Lambs, with Seyfried's humongous peepers a sad substitute for Jodie Foster's acting chops.
BAD Seyfried shows she's not the kind of actress who would be an easy victim in a Scream movie.
BAD It's one of those Hollywood movies that goes in one eye and out the other.
FAIR It's daffy, but it works.
BAD Despite Seyfried's suitably wide-eyed performance, director Heitor Dhalia holds too loose a grip on the suspense, driving the film into a succession of dramatic dead ends.
BAD Just very silly.
BAD Another squandering of Amanda Seyfried's talent, this low-mileage thriller won't be remembered for long.
BAD Gone and soon forgotten.
BAD Everything about 'Gone' has the plasticy, leatherette feel of an imitation thriller.
BAD The shortfall of suspense is emphasised with every pointless car chase, head-slapping contrivance, and attempt at tongue-in-cheekiness. This movie can seriously damage your IQ.
BAD A psychological thriller lacking in both psychological complexity and thrills.
BAD A frequently disastrous piece of work...
BAD ... far-fetched, devoid of surprises ...
BAD Just try not to hold the characters' behavior to any standard of the actual humans you may have crossed paths with in your life, and everything is fine.
BAD I'd say Gone is a shoo-in for one of the worst movies of 2012, except no one will remember it even existed by December.
FAIR It's fun watching Seyfried bluffing and conning her way through scene after scene; no opponent can best her.
BAD Gone wasn't screened in advance for critics and opened to a desultory $4.8 million gross. Anybody interested in seeing it better head to the theater posthaste, because after a couple more weeks, this mediocre effort is sure to be gone, baby, gone.
BAD So lame the only scare during the first hour is the old cat-jumping-into-frame trick.
BAD Put this on Lifetime and it might find an audience, but on the big screen nobody cares
BAD There's little to recommend this B-grade, formulaic affair. The plot is tosh, the dialogue hackneyed at best.
BAD Gifted and sincere as she always is, there's not much Ms. Seyfried can do with this tripe.
BAD It's a significant letdown that after all Jill's running, and all the guessing Seyfried makes us do, the climactic confrontation plays like an uninspired afterthought.
BAD The only thing worthwhile is seeing Portland (the filming location) on the big screen. It proves this landscape would be good for a thriller/horror, just not this one.
BAD A movie that makes "Murder on the Orient Express" feel like"The Silence of the Lambs"by comparison.
BAD Siblings aren't the only things missing from Gone: Suspense, scares and common sense are all likewise MIA.
BAD ...suspension of disbelief seems damn near impossible.
BAD ... a minor entry in the Kiss the Girls/Along Came a Spider line ... Seyfried isn't the least bit convincing in a role that called for hysteria cut with outrage. She manages little-girl peevishness.
BAD It lies there flapping like a dying fish. Skip it.
BAD Imagine Tyler Perry directing the lamest remake of Kiss the Girls imaginable and you can get a sense of how flat-out awful the storytelling and character development is in this one.
BAD Nearly a year has passed since the release of Catherine Hardwicke's Red Riding Hood, and Amanda Seyfried is still crying wolf.
BAD Ms. Seyfried belongs to a stable of blank-faced, saucer-eyed beauties whose limited appeal may conquer the small screen but so far has failed to tame the large.
BAD While Gone has some visual style, the cheap and melodramatic script fails to make it to the party.
FAIR I could not decide whether it was absolute garbage or a work of sheer genius.
BAD The title refers to your 12 bucks. This movie is as amateurish as Amanda Seyfried is pretty.
BAD nothing but schlock
BAD The film is so busy working hard to convict one rather shady character, it never convinces us of its own reason to exist.
BAD The acting occasionally borders on great. The story itself is more than worthy. But none of that comes close to overcoming the misguided pacing and overall lack of depth.
FAIR A somewhat flawed yet ultimately satisfying thriller.
BAD A story that's overloaded with research and unbridled speculation, all told with no clear direction.
FAIR The end result is intriguing, with a dash of a love story here and a twisty whodunit there. A fine performance by Ryan Gosling glues the mishmash together.
FAIR All Good Things isn't a pleasurable film to experience, but it offers an uncanny evocation of a narcissistic sociopath who doesn't come at us with the charm and sophistication that the typical screen bad guy has.
FAIR All Good Things is a crackerjack crime thriller.
BAD Ryan Gosling is sadly miscast as the villain in this poorly-written drama.
FAIR Jarecki never settles on what kind of story he wants to tell with these elements, and despite good performances, "All Good Things" veers awkwardly from love story to tragedy, from true-life mystery to black comedy.
BAD There's a fascinating story here for a bolder filmmaker, but after so much meandering it's a relief that All Good Things must come to an end.
FAIR One can't help but think that veteran documentarian Jarecki chose to rework this material as drama to benefit his career, not the story. The result is a disjointed art film that opts for ambiguity over clarity...
BAD Jarecki knows how to make scenes of boisterous family reunions and quiet moments between lovers engaging: He fares less well, though, when the story takes a dark turn.
GOOD ...a movie suspended between bold novelistic invention and journalistic reserve. Be it demerit or credit, Jarecki is no Truman Capote and All Good Things is no In Cold Blood.
FAIR Dunst shines brightly and puts on an acting showcase worthy of awards recognition in the supporting actress category. The picture loses its luster when her character disappears.
FAIR All Good Things is curiously underwhelming.
FAIR While the acting is superb and the film worth viewing, in this odd straddle between fact and fiction, the filmmakers miss the chance to bring more fictive power to the tale.
BAD a rather meticulously-detailed period piece that fails almost completely to offer up any human interest in its pursuit of human truth.
FAIR It also feels like one man's attempt to try another in the court of cinema, or perhaps correct the course of justice itself.
BAD Beset with a series of miscalculated dramatic misfires, the film is a melodramatic adaptation of a tabloid-style 20/20 murder-mystery, wearyingly overstuffed with baroque detail in an effort to prop up its legitimacy.
FAIR In his first fictional feature, [Jarecki ] can't decide whether to opt for the open-ended inquiry of a non-fiction film or the resolved storytelling of Hollywood genre movie, so he winds up stranded in between.
FAIR The second half is at once unconventional and straightforward -- the former because of the actual content, the latter in terms of structure in which it's presented.
BAD Gosling and co-stars Kirsten Dunst and Frank Langella don't do anything wrong here but the movie is such a mash-up of tones, fiction, and reality that it never comes together into anything coherent.
GOOD Kirsten Dunst is so good here as a woman at a loss to understand who her husband really is, and what the true nature of his family involves.
FAIR Too bad it's not a doc, which might have revealed the secrecy and confusion that led to such a legendary case remaining unsolved.
BAD You never feel you can trust that Jarecki knows what he's doing, which becomes even more problematic when the movie asks us to believe its theory about an unsolved crime.
FAIR "All Good Things" has the eerie power of a nightmare.
FAIR As excellent as Gosling is - and the actor conveys the stillness of the man as well as the voices screaming in his head - Dunst matches him stride for stride.
FAIR It's a strange, thrilling tale begrimed by bad memories, by bad deeds.
BAD full review at Movies for the Masses
BAD Dunst is not the only person doing quality work in "All Good Things," but she is the only one worth watching.
FAIR You watch it wanting to scurry off to read accounts of the real thing, rather than being caught up in the filmmaking.
FAIR beneath the surface are all kinds of questions about power and wealth and the cyclical nature of familial tragedy, and while they break through from time to time, it is never enough to give the film more depth than a TrueTV documentary
FAIR Fascinating study of criminal justice in the crumbling Nazi empire of 1944.
BAD It crouches but -- alas -- never springs.
GOOD I LOVE this movie. Bad sequels take away from the original.
FAIR Surprisingly not-awful cable-flick action-fest!
GOOD A fascinating exercise in cinematic restraint resulting in a captivating, not to be missed film.
GOOD With A History Of Violence, Cronenberg uses the pulp gangster genre - as opposed to, say, sci-fi horror -- to draw us into a dialogue on our relationship as voyeurs to violence, both real and cinematic.
GOOD While it weakens in its final stretch...A History of Violence succeeds enormously thanks to the strength of its direction and performances.
GOOD The violence that enters the characters' perfect domestic existence is permanent, and each act reveals truths about the people who use it and the audience who enjoys it.
FAIR The movie begins slowly, methodically, and builds increasingly toward a devastating climax.
GOOD The tension builds in a slow boil, then ignites furiously when we're not quite ready for it.
FAIR Mr. Mortensen and the sparse, intelligent script hold it together.
FAIR full review in Greek
FAIR A strange David Cronenberg movie, and not in the usual audaciously morbid way. A brooding, contemplative picture that's tough, tight and masterfully controlled.
FAIR Lo mas reciente del canadiense David Cronenberg es un solido thriller, casi de factura clasica, sobre las ramificaciones de la violencia.
GOOD There are elements in this film that are 100% Cronenberg (the beautiful violence we so rarely see these days, subtle weird humor), but this is not your typical Cronenberg
GOOD What Mortensen does brilliantly is to keep us guessing.
GOOD Tematicamente ambicioso, demonstra ter seguranca suficiente da forca de sua narrativa ao permitir que o espectador saia do cinema sem estar completamente certo de como tudo terminou. E esta talvez seja uma de suas maiores virtudes.
FAIR Never does it deviate from Cronenberg's primal instincts.
BAD ... like biting into a sour pickle hidden in the bottom of your ice cream cone... simply fails to deliver what it promises to fulfill another agenda.
FAIR Three-fourths of this movie is great, but don't get me started on that ending.
BAD I have mixed feelings. Cool, engaging, well acted (William Hurt is brilliant). But could have used a bit more shaving in the editing room and a bit messy on point.
GOOD On the surface, this may seem just a violent gangster yarn, but Cronenberg has opened the door to a train of thought that becomes more disturbing the longer you consider it.
FAIR a pretty good little thriller, but clocking in at only 95 minutes, it doesn't have enough meat to be a truly satisfying drama.
BAD [David Cronenberg] no doubt wanted to say something profound about the nature of violence, but his approach betrays his intentions.
GOOD Some movies are to be consumed and discarded. History of Violence, a drama of disarming power, is not one of those. This is one of the most stirring films of the year.
BAD Olson should have studied a history of screenwriting before attempting to adapt A History of Violence. One of the most aimless, derivative films to ever be overrated.
GOOD A tense, tight and pithy thriller with such superb restraint that almost every detail matters -- and therefore shouldn't be spoiled.
GOOD A History of Violence is a fine movie that simply is too intense for many viewers.
GOOD This is Sin City with a functioning brain
GOOD Cronenberg knows this territory well, drawing parallels between sex, violence, and companionship...in this mature, compelling movie.
GOOD Violence is a turn-on, Cronenberg seems to be saying, but a turn-on that comes with a destructively high price.
FAIR Not nearly as awful as it could have been...it at least knows that it's cheesy, which makes it more fun.
BAD It's not really clear why this movie was necessary %u2013 it does not reinvent the 50's movie so much as do a highly faithful cover version of it. (Gus Van Sandy's shot-for-shot remake of Psycho is a similar pointless academic exercise.)
FAIR ...gently wacky. Although breezy and sketchy on the easy laughs at times, Alien Trespass does promise to entertain for the sole purpose of its campy off-kilter makeup.
FAIR If the film succeeds perfectly in its aim, to recreate exactly a genre of films noted for how shoddy and boring they were, is it then fair to complain when the film is itself boring?
BAD Alien Trespass won't let our knowledge of the stereotypes it incorporates do the work and make the critique.
FAIR If you're willing to check your brain at the door and to suspend a lot of your disbelief, Alien Trespass manages to be a delightfully zany and campy satire best experienced at midnight with a group of friends.
FAIR A true love letter to genre days gone by, Alien Trespass delivers on its promise to bring back a slice of the good old days to horror cinema.
FAIR While it never rises to the level of Galaxy Quest, my gold standard for funny sci-fi films, Alien Trespass consistently delights and amuses.
BAD Retro-style sci-fi action spoof tries hard but doesn't work.
FAIR A highly entertaining retro Sci-fi blast from the past that is loads of fun, an endearing tribute to all those bad movies we just loved.
BAD ... once those warm, fuzzy feelings of nostalgia start to wear off, all you are left with is a tedious movie that is full of wooden performances, campy dialogue, cheesy and outdated special effects, eerie music and space beings in rubber suits.
BAD This lazy effort gets points only for truly loving -- perhaps to a fault -- the cheapo creature flicks of the 1950s.
BAD Alien Trespass, with a rating notice that mentions 'brief historical smoking,' is at least better than last year's official remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still.
BAD It's a satire without laughs, a parody without punch lines, a careful copy that replicates everything except the original's life.
FAIR How much you enjoy this strange picture depends on two things: Your appreciation of the genre that is being feted here, and the enthusiasm of the audience that you view it with.
FAIR Alien Trespass is an intriguing experiment, and I admire its craftsmanship.
BAD If you're not going to have fun with such a silly cinematic subgenre, what's the point in resurrecting it? Or, from the more pertinent audience point of view, in seeing it?
BAD A charmingly sentimental but ultimately pointless homage to the sci-fi classics of yesteryear.
BAD Fun at first, the movie quickly wears thin. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but if that's your choice, you better be sure the thing you're imitating is worthy of it.
BAD While Alien Trespass stays true to the era and the genre, it forgets that its mission in this galaxy is not merely to pay tribute but to entertain.
BAD Alien Trespass, which opens Friday on the heels of the witty Monsters vs. Aliens, feels like an also-ran.
BAD Bewildered? You won't be alone.
BAD Alien Trespass, an affectionate tribute to flying saucer movies, treats the cliches of drive-in sci-fi with touching naivete. So why isn't it more fun?
BAD To see how Alien Trespass might have been done, rent The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra with its puppet monster on visible strings, its dime-store sets and its dreadful artificial dialogue.
FAIR Alien Trespass could be the latest bulletin from Mystery Science Theatre 3000 except that we're the silhouetted heads and the filmmakers are sitting right there next to us.
FAIR At a certain point you find yourself thinking, why not watch the real It Came From Outer Space, instead of this mildly amusing replica?
BAD A pale imitation of a drive-in movie, with nothing silly or sloppy enough to qualify as camp.
BAD ...suffers from an egregiously laid-back pace that ultimately negates its few positive attributes...
BAD In the end, the script lets the film down with its obvious twists, its naggingly illogical narrative and a general pointlessness.
BAD A final reel of arterial spray splatter empties itself in record time and when Gone finally gets going, it's gone too soon.
BAD You will be kept waiting for the twist that never comes in Ringan Ledwidge's derivative psycho-thriller, whose by-the-numbers plotting is as inevitable as roadkill.
FAIR If only it had taken the characters' lead and strayed further from the beaten track...
FAIR A potentially menacing first half is let down by a few cliches in the home stretch.
BAD Like so many movies, the set-up and presentation of Gamer is awesome. The story, characters and writing... not so much.
BAD Wait for this one on Cable... jeez I'm saying that a lot. What is really going on in 2009?
BAD What to make of short-attention-span artists satirizing a short-attention-span world? [Blu-ray]
BAD Incoherent and interminable...
BAD a big, loud mess that loses its few good ideas in a morass of convoluted storytelling that it has, sadly, confused with stylish innovation
FAIR Like the 'Crank' films, this is an absurdly exaggerated, outlandishly crass and alternately inventive and appalling depiction of a man violently fighting to liberate himself from the forces that seek to control him...
FAIR An injection of adrenaline straight to the eye - which isn't entirely a bad thing.
BAD If you are a gamer, and like shooters, science fiction, action, and wouldn't consider gratuitous boob shots gratuitous, you won't feel short-changing on leaving the cinema after watching Gamer.
BAD Can I get back the ninety minutes of my life that I squandered sitting through this miasmic upchuck of techno sludge? What was the story again?
FAIR With its nano-technology synching different brains together, spyware programs attached to DNA, and a double dose of bad taste served up with a side-dish of splattered brains and skull fragments, Gamer is still mad, bad, and dangerous to know.
FAIR It won't win points for originality or depth, but the Crank boys are still on their game as far as sex, violence and sheer unapologetic excess go. High concept, high octane, highly likely to end up a post-pub staple.
BAD While packed with guns, girls and gore, there's none of the gleeful knowingness that made their earlier films such guilty pleasures.
BAD Edited with the finesse of a toddler on a sherbet dib-dab rush, the film dashes from one over-stylised battle sequence to the next.
BAD The action sequences are disappointing, there's a distinct lack of wit or invention in the direction and it's also impossible to care about the characters when they're so thinly sketched.
BAD The film is a cacophonous mess without a single interesting character.
BAD The best that can be said about Gamer is "straight to DVD". It's a mind-numbing dud of a movie that in reality is nothing more than a big budget computer game splashed across the silver screen with an all star cast.
FAIR Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor deserve some credit for being upfront about their desire to deliver purely adrenaline-driven action cinema and for making it look brilliant.
FAIR Were Stanley Kubrick and Russ Meyer alive and their minds merged "Being John Malkovich"-style, the clash of their ids and egos might yield "Gamer." It will make you feel putrid, but it's satire that's sadistic, salacious and audaciously entertaining.
FAIR attempts to lure audiences in with its fast-action but also provides a surprisingly thoughtful commentary on control and freedom and the means some will go to achieve it.
GOOD Puts the viscera in visceral but a thought-provoking exploration of our increasingly disconnected society in drag as mindless action.
BAD Takes itself far too seriously, saying nothing of timeliness or value in a banally overblown fashion.
BAD Poor editing makes Gamer overlong, and the negative portrayal of gamers is as hard to swallow as the cheesy plot.
BAD It is, in the end, a migraine in search of a movie-goer, one that hypocritically berates pop-culture's bloodthirst even as it eagerly quenches it with a sadistic barrage of severed limbs and crushed skulls.
GOOD Perhaps the most deliriously demented film of the year. I say that with honest admiration for the deliriously demented.
BAD A lot of good actors waste their time and talent in a very disappointing movie
BAD In the press materials Mr. Butler informs us enthusiastically that the movie "has all the hallmarks of Neveldine's and Taylor's sick, yet genius minds." At least he's half right.
BAD Bodies and buildings blow up but this is carnage of the most lacklustre sort, with any momentum petering out long before it's "game over."
BAD It's a deeply cynical and joyless point of view, completely lacking in the winking visual style that made Crank worth a look.
BAD Add an element of interactivity into the hyperkinetic, repetitive action, plodding narrative, and stupefyingly obvious social commentary, and the potential might exist for something entertaining.
BAD The game sequences are all familiar flash, and zero tension.
FAIR A cautionary tale issuing a dire warning about the prospects for humanity in a world where machines lead and people follow.
FAIR I happily anticipated seeing what the writer/director team of the two 'Crank' movies would come up with next.
BAD A mindless and tedious sci-fi action film that's high on style while low on substance and palpable thrills.
BAD It's a mess of a film mainly because the "CRANK"-style of filmmaking doesn't really fit with the material because for the most part, the movie is played straight. It's a real shame cause the premise sounded ridiculously fun
BAD Gamer scratches at the shameless energy of the Crank films occasionally, but it mostly goes, as if on rails, to the inevitable conclusion.
BAD A dull slog of endless action and sex, trying so hard to push the pleasure centers on the brains of its adolescent male audience that it wears itself, and the audience, out
BAD The action scenes are a giant blurry glob of explosions, sudden attacks and spontaneous graphic deaths.
BAD Manages to make even watching naked strippers in a hot tub a laborious experience.
BAD [Ben Affleck's] Jack Ryan is simply impossible to take seriously, and that's something the film could probably never survive.
BAD Generic action film not good for kids, or anyone.
FAIR Though this political adventure requires substantial suspension of disbelief, the witty script and mature approach keep the film on track. [Blu-Ray]
FAIR ... Entertaining and far more relevant than most other action/adventure movies.
BAD Has enough cliches and cut-out characters to condemn it to mediocrity.
GOOD Realizando um bom trabalho ao condensar o complexo livro de Clancy, o filme e tenso, inteligente e conta com fortes atuacoes de todo o elenco - inclusive de Affleck, que confere uma curiosa vulnerabilidade ao heroi.
GOOD It's a tired premise, and it's got its flaws, but the present talent makes it worthwhile.
FAIR Tom Clancy franchise gets a surprisingly satisfying reinvention thanks to star Ben Affleck and director Phil Alden Robinson.
FAIR It's all fast and loud and pulse-pounding, of course, but nothing that we haven't seen dozens of times on screen after imaginary disasters.
GOOD Superior genre storytelling, which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line.
FAIR The Sum of All Fears proves that the Jack Ryan franchise still has some legs. Most importantly, it also has a brain.
BAD Clancy's world is strictly for the techno-nerds and frankly they're welcome to it.
FAIR Deals with a chillingly topical nuclear attack on Baltimore. But perhaps more disturbingly, it rehashes it into a Ben Affleck action romance.
GOOD All shame aside, not being a Tom Clancy fan or Jack Ryan fan, I did quite enjoy it. Is it Morgan Freeman?
BAD An implausible apocalypse without depth or resonance, a cartoon of international politics presented with no James Bond-like playfulness and with all the superficial realism money can buy.
FAIR El filme provoca que la audiencia piense y medite sobre el mundo en que habitamos, asi como en los obsoletos sistemas de gobierno que hemos creado como sociedad.
FAIR A competent Tom Clancy thriller that's betrayed by a miscast Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan.
FAIR If nothing else, this film may stand as a cultural testament to how times really have changed since Sept. 11 -- and not necessarily the way we'd expect.
BAD (Not) the biggest or best film of this summer's blockbuster season, but it does hold up well under fire as long as you don't think about anything too hard.
FAIR To sum it up: heavy on imagination and light on reality.
GOOD A Alden Robinson, el director, le sento bien la amistad con Tom Hanks y Spielberg al haber dirigido recientemente para la TV, el drama de guerra Band of Brothers.
BAD Affleck's performance is so lightweight that he feels like a secondary character, barely involved with this struggle against a terrorist nuclear attack.
BAD The star who helped give a spark to "Chasing Amy" and "Changing Lanes" falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer's new action film, "The Sum of All Fears."
BAD ...post-September 11, "The Sum Of All Fears" seems more tacky and reprehensible, manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves.
FAIR takes on a gut-churning immediacy that is hard to deny
FAIR Sum" is Jack Ryan's "do-over." Give credit to everyone from Robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works. Especially give credit to Affleck.
GOOD Action-packed and exciting!
FAIR A tense, capably-made film that's exciting and realistic enough to satisfy filmgoers who've had their fill of Hollywood's usual ultra-unrealistic blockbuster fare.
BAD I've felt more drama watching tornado chasers on The Weather Channel.
BAD Retreads a lot of familiar elements from other "international thrillers" while occasionally dipping its foot into the real-life horror of terrorism.
BAD Affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into, a role that Ford effortlessly filled with authority.
BAD The film doesn't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously, it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA.
FAIR It's been eight years since Clear and Present Danger, but this late-blooming entry shows that none of the luster has worn off the series.
BAD Is Ben Affleck such an indispensable talent -- or box-office draw -- that his presence is worth wrecking an entire film franchise to accomodate his youth?
FAIR Affleck gets better with each film. It will be interesting to see him age with the Jack Ryan role.
BAD Never in film history will there be a more nonchalant nuclear holocaust.
GOOD Its politics are abhorrent to me, but my god, it's such a slick, well-crafted thriller ... that I can't hate it
FAIR A tense thriller that holds your attention to the very end. The film is aided by one of Bernard Hermann's better scores.
BAD Tedious remake of a "thriller" that wasn't that thrilling to begin with
GOOD Keep-you-up-all-night terrifying!
FAIR The remake with De Niro had the most to fear from this superior little thriller!
GOOD A classic revenge thriller.
GOOD works best as a twisted nail-biter, punctuated brilliantly with an apocalyptic score by Bernard Herrmann
BAD A sempre presente narracao em off e um dos muitos problemas do filme - especialmente se considerarmos que o narrador e justamente um escritor mediocre.
BAD In Fear was made for next to nothing but that is not always a virtue. After an adequate start its storyline goes precisely nowhere.
FAIR A lost-in-the-woods horror predominantly set within a car's claustrophobic confines, this is certainly one of the better films of late to play with fear of the dark.
GOOD Sometimes the most effective horror films come with the simplest premise and this is certainly the case with Jeremy Lovering's In Fear.
BAD In Fear is a slickly made, impressively pared-down horror/thriller but is too abstract for its own good - it is hard to feel any great emotional identification (or fear) for characters who so sketchily written.
GOOD With limited resources [Jeremy Lovering] has created a disturbingly tense and chilling scenario we can all identify with.
GOOD For the most part In Fear, largely improvised with the two leads only broadly aware of the general direction of the story, is a quiet triumph.
FAIR For all the intense, arm-gripping fun, an all-too-familiar denouement means that, much like their car, it runs out of gas late on.
FAIR ... young couple takes a very wrong turn. UK helmer Lovering tightens the screws the old-fashioned way, through atmosphere and suggestion ... (It) possesses a bleakly funny Pinter-esque quality.
GOOD A masterful example of lean 'n' mean outdoor nightmare-making that resonates with the same power of Wolf Creek, but without all the torture and gore.
FAIR The actors didn't know exactly where the script was going, but their improvised dialogue moves authentically from teasing to discomfort to light jokes about something deeper.
GOOD Sometimes, a horror film needs nothing more than the right cast, the right setting, and an elegantly streamlined story to effectively induce dread. Such is the case with In Fear.
BAD This could have worked as a contained horror flick, but when you're sitting there shaking your head over and over at the characters' inexplicable actions, there's very little chance that you're going to sympathize with them or get engaged in their plight.
GOOD "In Fear" is an oft-frightening film that stays with you. One of the most accomplished genre offerings of the last few years, it is a must for horror fans and suspense enthusiasts.
BAD There are traces of films such as The Hitcher, House of 1000 Corpses, Joy Ride, and Hush wrapped up in the DNA of In Fear, but unfortunately that DNA is more of a clone than its own identity.
GOOD Genuinely scary and suspenseful because it leaves room for imagination and doesn't rely on gore or use a "found footage" device.
FAIR "In Fear" takes a small task and a hooky premise and runs with them, providing some good jolts over the course of its barely-90-minute length.
FAIR A wicked little horror film in which nearly all of the violence takes place in your head, "In Fear" expertly builds terror out of not much more than two people driving around in a car.
BAD We never know Lucy and Tom enough to care about their survival.
BAD As an exercise in stomach-knotting, In Fear is mildly successful [...] All the pieces are in place for a gripping indie horror flick, but [the] film just goes around in circles.
GOOD In Fear lets its increasingly rattled characters stew for as long as possible before gradually revealing its hand, improvisation adding to the credibility of the couple's unravelling behaviour.
GOOD It's one of the year's best horror movies, full stop.
FAIR A smart, disturbing exercise in anxiety.
FAIR Runs in circles of queasy inspiration for a good hour. Then follows the not-so-good half hour.
FAIR Claustrophobic and creepy, this experiment in contained horror has its moments as just three characters circle around each other.
FAIR Spiky, semi-improvised Brit horror singles out director Jeremy Lovering as one to keep a beady eye on.
GOOD Reminiscent of classic era John Carpenter, this is British horror at its ruthless, rural best.
GOOD Both young actors seem even more promising after the movie than they did before it. Neither was given the full script or knew the story's outcome.
GOOD Most writer-directors don't know how to start a film like this, let alone finish it, and as a portrait of two people hopelessly lost and horribly scared it's a haunting watch.
GOOD Grips like a 4x4, even as the escalating tension threatens to spin out of control.
FAIR There are a few decent jolts en route before it runs out of gas and ideas.
FAIR It may be contrived and nothing new plot-wise, but In Fear has atmosphere and enough proper scares to deliver on the promise of its title.
GOOD A taut, chilling little horror-thriller making maximum use of minimal resources to tap into our primal fears of the unknown. Plus shredded-nerve turns from an (evidently) adaptable cast.
FAIR This is a great film to watch curled up with a date on a dark and stormy night. One thing's for sure- you won't be eager to go on any road trips right after.
GOOD Stylishly shot and almost unbearably tense, this is an atmospheric and genuinely scary British chiller with a superb script and a pair of excellent performances from Englert and De Caestecker.
GOOD A most welcome, utterly delightful treat.
