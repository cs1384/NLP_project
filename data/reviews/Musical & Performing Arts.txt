0.6 <|###|> Begin Again is a delight, not only because of its infectious musical vitality but because it follows the unexpected forks in the road.
0.6 <|###|> It's not nearly as good as "Once" but still very charming and entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> John Carney's retread never gets close to replicating the stunning emotional core of Once. But for those seeing Begin Again from a fresh perspective, it's ( ... ) a more light-hearted ( ... ) alternative to the Coen Bros' Inside Llewyn Davis.
0.625 <|###|> The best thing about 'Begin Again' is what it's not. It's not a love story, or at least not a conventional love story; it's more of a friendship story between a man and a woman, which is something we almost never see in movies.
0.7 <|###|> I've seen happier endings in Oklahoma! and Singin' in the Rain, but this one feels genuine - and in an unexpected way, deeply satisfying.
0.6 <|###|> Knightley (supplying her own vocals, more than just competently so, by the way) and Ruffalo have a casual chemistry that works, and Levine is (perhaps unsurprisingly) totally right as a self-absorbed jerk.
0.8 <|###|> I really enjoyed this. It's such a nice surprise, because so many so-called feel-good romantic comedies these days are pretty ordinary but there's something special about this because there's a level of reality to it in the performances in the situations.
0.8 <|###|> There's a freshness to this film.
0.875 <|###|> Bonds born out of art, and specifically music, are nothing new in the movies, but Carney conveys the uniquely exhilarating romance of the creative process behind art like no other filmmaker.
0.8 <|###|> John Carney is not afraid of a cliche. After all, Begin Again is a musical, a genre that has always thrived on them. And he does know how to shape them to his own design, which is low-key and slightly tongue-in-cheek.
0.6 <|###|> Thankfully Begin Again doesn't take the predictable routes; it seems to actively reject the easy romantic tropes.
1.0 <|###|> People who love music, people who love great films, and people who love both, are sure to love 'Begin Again,' an exquisite film by John Carney, who wrought the equally superb 'Once.'
0.75 <|###|> You'll find a mismatched pair to pull for and a lot of sincerity in this musical romance by the creator of Once.
0.8 <|###|> In its best moments - which are not infrequent - is appealing mostly on the backs of watching interesting, capable people going on with their business in an engaged, focused manner.
0.875 <|###|> This is the kind of film that lifts your spirits. If you've had a bad day or are generally feeling down, it will cheer you up. If you're already feeling happy, it will make you even happier.
0.75 <|###|> ...breezy and consistently watchable...
0.8 <|###|> a light and dancing comedy about fresh starts
0.7 <|###|> A mostly pleasant but deeply flawed little film that gets by on its stars and a sense of generosity.
0.8 <|###|> I found it moving, funny and really rather charming, provoking more than enough laughter and tears to dispel my underlying anxieties about the "live" performances.
0.75 <|###|> The wholesome, hopeful, let's-put-on-a-show enthusiasm may sound hokey but it's actually infectiously joyful. At the same time, Carney roughs up the edges just enough to make this fairy tale seem somewhat accessible and realistic.
0.8 <|###|> The result is a film that, while fitting into various great traditions, still bears the unmistakable thumbprint of a singular film-maker.
0.875 <|###|> Carney's latest isn't quite the equal of Once, but who could have twice bottled that lightning?
0.75 <|###|> Irish writer-director John Carney is a master at depicting musicians on the cusp of something special.
0.75 <|###|> This soulful outing is sure to please music lovers. And isn't that everyone?
0.9 <|###|> Keira Knightley sings and so does the movie!
0.8 <|###|> A decent feel-good flick that features also decent music. The real reason to see it is the acting especially that of Mark Ruffalo who gives a career best performance.
0.8 <|###|> A cheery charmer that brings a smile to the face.
0.8 <|###|> Fans of Once - or, indeed, anyone with a heart - will be swept away by the gentle, sweet-but-sad story.
0.625 <|###|> Begin Again is a not-entirely-successful movie about not selling out; it's a theme that must concern Carney deeply.
0.89 <|###|> It's a movie that is painfully sincere and free of guile, with as close to a happy ending as these characters could ever get. If you like musicals, well, here's a good one.
0.6 <|###|> The gentle lightning of Once doesn't strike twice for Carney, but his latest music movie has charm beneath its slick surface - and Knightley and Ruffalo harmonise just fine.
0.6 <|###|> Keira Knightley plays Greta, a Norah Jones-like singer-songwriter... It's a typically brave performance from an actress who is always prepared to try anything.
0.6 <|###|> At times, the scenes are so canned they feel like soap opera. But the movie does have its fair share of decent moments thanks to Ruffalo and co-star Catherine Keener.
0.4 <|###|> It's all a bit easy - though quite nicely performed - and Knightley is never entirely convincing ...
0.625 <|###|> Can a meaningful glance mean as much as a kiss? In this film, it can, and that's enough.
0.75 <|###|> No matter how thin the drama, or thick the performances, the film's firefly-in-a-jar, midsummer night's whimsy and heart-on-its-sleeve optimism hath charms ...
0.6 <|###|> Keira Knightley brings a sweet soul to John Carney's delightful sort-of sequel to his low-fi hit, Once.
0.6 <|###|> The film is a fairy tale: sentimental but enjoyable if you put a few protective fingers in front of your face to avoid being slurped to death.
0.4 <|###|> John Carney returns with another feature-length music video, turning the surprising charm of his debut, Once, a novel take on the modern musical romance, into a shameless gimmick. Just call it Twice.
0.6 <|###|> Knightley's bullish Britishness and Ruffalo's bruised charm provide a pleasingly gentle, unsentimental chemistry and, heck, there's even James Corden on a kazoo.
