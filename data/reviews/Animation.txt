1.0 <|###|> Nick Park is a genius. Enough said.
1.0 <|###|> A quest for cheese has never been more gutbustingly funny.
0.7 <|###|> Funny for families of all ages, this animated comedy is a rare and delightful treat.
0.75 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits is cinematic booty that shines like gold.
0.8 <|###|> The Pirates! is the first truly great animated film of the year: a painstakingly-modelled laugh riot that boggles the mind while tickling the funnybone.
0.625 <|###|> It's got great vocal talent and well-done animation, but it proves once again that the story is the key ingredient.
0.9 <|###|> A rollicking good time that offers enough broad comedy mixed with more cerebral sight gags to ensure this will be a family favourite for years to come.
0.625 <|###|> It's full of jokes for adults that will fly right over kids' heads, but retains just enough plot conflict and slapstick to keep younger audiences involved as well.
0.7 <|###|> The Aardman folks might not have created a pirate film to rival the big screen's best, but they've created a subtle parody of pirate movies that's well worth watching.
0.85 <|###|> Yes, the film feels childish, but in the best possible way.
0.6 <|###|> ... enough amusing throwaway gags to keep us entertained.
0.6 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits deserves two doubloons up. It shivered me funny bone.
0.875 <|###|> The fun, infectious tone is set early on and never peters out. The humor is kind of like Monty Python for kids.
0.75 <|###|> Droll and charming, and will probably appeal more to fans of Monty Python and 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' than to young kids...
0.8 <|###|> This is a very funny, very good looking movie getting lost in the fray.
0.75 <|###|> The best laughs come around the fringes, with great throwaway gags and Grant's usual self-deprecating way with dialogue.
0.5 <|###|> A few funny lines and a great vocal turn by Hugh Grant. All else is unexciting. Can't see the kids going wild over this one.
0.7 <|###|> Deserves no small amount of credit for being an absolute delight... and for never acting like the viewer is an idiot even as it never requires that the viewer be a genius.
0.8 <|###|> As a running gag, the man-panzee is pretty predictable, but as an observation of how cute creatures are perpetually manipulated and abused in family entertainments, it is rather rich.
0.875 <|###|> It's hard to emphasize enough just how intricate it is, abundant with rich details... At the same time, it's also warmly human, with characters so expressive you'll want to join the crew.
0.8 <|###|> The majority of the film can't quite live up to this barnstorming first half hour, but it remains a delight throughout, even when the gags become a little more hit and miss.
0.75 <|###|> Another winner from Aardman
0.5 <|###|> I wish I could call the plot about a dodo bird 'whimsical,' but there just wasn't enough laughs from these 'Pirates.'
0.5 <|###|> The filmmakers have said they are already dreaming up a sequel. They needn't hurry. Whatever treasures these pirates have are well buried.
0.7 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits, succeeds in spite of a faint but persistent sense of factory settings and finishes.
0.625 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits fares OK against most modern toon flicks but pales next to other Aardman releases. How a person chooses to rate its success depends on whether one looks at a glass of water and views it as half-full or half-empty.
0.8 <|###|> a gem of a movie that deserves more praise and audience than it'll probably get
0.875 <|###|> Delivers all of the laughs, giggles and guffaws land lubbers like us want in a silly film like this.
0.6 <|###|> There is a lot to like about The Pirates!, especially for those of us who watch a lot of BBC America.
0.6 <|###|> Young and old alike love a good pirate yarn and the stop-motion specialists at Aardman Animations deliver the goods.
0.8 <|###|> Pirate adventure blends Victorian history, high-seas fun.
0.8 <|###|> Pirates haven't generated this many laughs since Johnny Depp's first dip into the Caribbean.
0.8 <|###|> Even with all the enormous pirate ships, detailed cityscapes and dazzling action, Pirates! is at its best when it focuses on the sillier, calmer moments.
