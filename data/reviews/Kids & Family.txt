GOOD Nick Park is a genius. Enough said.
GOOD A quest for cheese has never been more gutbustingly funny.
FAIR They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but it can make for some awfully dull films. The line between inspiration and imitation is fine crossed repeatedly. Pride and Glory isn't the worst offender, just the latest.
BAD No button remains unpushed, no shred of scenery remains unshredded and no F-bomb remains unuttered.
FAIR Pride and Glory doesn't add anything to the generic crooked-cop procedural that we haven't seen with more verve in better movies.
FAIR This predictable police corruption story with an A-list cast explores themes of family and honesty as two cop brothers uncover the dirt on their brother-in-law's violent activity, while senior cop Dad tries to keep things under control.
FAIR Uma pena que o filme jamais consiga escapar realmente do lugar comum, implodindo de vez em seu terrivel terceiro ato.
BAD Hard to watch, hard to listen to and hard to follow.
BAD The actors in Pride and Glory do their best with this cliched material, but the film is so grim, ugly and miserable that it's difficult to sympathise with even the most positive characters.
FAIR Director and co-writer Gavin O'Connor is the son of a former New York policeman, and displays a strong grasp of the familial and fraternal ties that bind his characters together.
FAIR While its kinetic appeal does have a numbing - if temporary effect - on your critical faculties, television has been much more successful in claiming this territory as its own.
BAD Relentlessly dour, filled with unsympathetic characters, and made out of cardboard melodrama. It's the last of those sins that is unforgivable. [Blu-ray]
BAD ...only skims the surface of its characters and offers nothing new in the way of corrupt law enforcement.
FAIR Elevated by superb performances, led by Edward Norton and a very chilling Colin Farrell.
BAD What's especially lamentable is that this movie strands yet another exemplary turn by Edward Norton, who once again is superior to the material surrounding him.
BAD Pride and Glory is a bleak, boring and hopelessly familiar corrupt cop story that simply does not work despite the determined, top-of-their-game efforts of O'Connor and Norton, not to mention Colin Farrell, Jon Voight and others.
FAIR A well-acted and tightly structured piece that would be more impactful if there weren't a feeling that we've seen it before.
BAD Bloody, violent and increasingly derivative, 'Pride and Glory' betrays its initial promise as a small-scale, 'Godfather'-esque social tapestry with crude plotting, variable acting and an all-too-guessable storyline and conclusion.
BAD Solid yet unremarkable, Pride And Glory will never win points for originality. With committed turns from Norton and Farrell, it does enough - just - to keep you interested. But this is one film that neither covers itself in pride or glory.
BAD A detonation of flatulent, macho-sentimental gibberish is what this ugly and violent film positively farts out of the screen at you.
BAD But, hackneyed, unconvincing and ultimately preposterous, Pride and Glory should be made to hand in its badge.
GOOD It doesn't quite pack the wallop that O'Connor intended, a daft fight near the end may evoke laughs and it probably won't be storming the Academy, but don't be shocked if you enjoy this as much as Marty's Oscar victor.
BAD Here's an excruciatingly dated and derivative New York cop movie.
FAIR After similar but much better fare such as Martin Scorsese's The Departed and The Wire TV series, we've come to expect an awful lot from our bent copper dramas and, while satisfactory, Pride And Glory just isn't in the same league.
BAD When Noah Emmerich, who plays Tierney's NYPD brother, said "this s*** ends now", the Sneak thought "glory be" - only for the story to drag on for another 20 minutes.
FAIR This bad-apple cop drama is the kind of movie that Sidney Lumet used to make in the Seventies and Eighties, and it hasn't evolved a great deal since.
BAD However skilful Gavin O'Connor is as a film-maker - and there are some striking sequences here - we've seen this corrupt cop thriller a hundred times before.
FAIR Watchable cop thriller with strong performances and suitably gritty direction, but the climax gets bogged down in some embarrassingly awful cliches.
BAD If cop movie cliches are a crime against cinema, Pride and Glory should be under arrest.
BAD Christmas is definitely cancelled in this over-acted, over-here movie. Presumably the tinsel was CGI'd in to complement the season of its release.
BAD passionate performances in a story that is a series of letter-perfect cliches
GOOD A dramatic, tense story of mixed loyalties in an NYPD family with standout performances by Norton, Farrell, Voight, Emmerich, and Ehle.
GOOD Relentlessly grim, appropriately abrasive and beautifully filmed, "Pride and Glory" recalls Sidney Lumet's heyday. It proves there's still meat left on the bones of bad-cop thrillers, but it wisely doesn't offer a Handi-Wipe after its final course.
BAD It's a tale you've seen a good 100 times before, and if only 85 of those 100 are actually better than Pride and Glory, the other 15 aren't any worse.
FAIR I'm not sure how many times the F bomb gets dropped, but it's more than you'll hear it in the average R-rated drama.
BAD Pride and Glory: Cops arrested by cliches.
FAIR Run of the mill cop drama elevated only by the acting of the supporting cast - Jennifer Ehle is heartbreaking
BAD Norton and Farrell are both too good to have been shortchanged by this been-there-done-that script.
FAIR That noise you hear is the soundtrack of We Own the Night, which is playing next door in the multiplex of your memory. Yes, there are undeniable similarities between the two pictures.
FAIR Sing carols to your babies instead.
GOOD Thrilling, touching adventure for animal lovers.
GOOD A lovely and unjustly forgotten family film.
FAIR Somehow makes the story of orphaned geese entertaining.
GOOD Story of a girl and her geese is complex entertainment for kids and grown-ups.
GOOD From bumbling infants to majestic adults, a flock hasn't been this charismatic onscreen since Hitchcock went bird-watching.
GOOD It's a genuine delight and a definite thumbs aloft for kids of about six upwards.
FAIR Beautiful looking and well acted, but lacking in the kind of tension that marks a well-told tale.
GOOD This dark coming-of-age story is a unique romp.
BAD Nine-year-old kids may sit through it and have fun, but nine-year-olds would also eat french fries 23 hours a day if their parents didn't force them to try something more nutritious.
GOOD Seventy-five years on, it hasn't dated in the slightest.
GOOD The central themes of illusions, dreams and going on an extraordinary adventure all the better to come home and appreciate what you have there are enduring.
GOOD One of Hollywood's quintessential productions, this musical adaptation of L Frank Baum's classic fable is probably the most beloved fantasy film of all time and the ultimate family picture.
GOOD This family classic long ago left the realm of being mere entertainment to emerge as a cultural touchstone for generations of Americans.
GOOD The Wizard of Oz is the cinematic equivalent of high-end wine, in that it gets better with age. The difference is that while wine must remain unopened to increase in value, the film positively thrives on it being tasted and shared over and over and over.
GOOD MGM's fantastic IMAX 3D conversion for the The Wizard of Oz's 75th anniversary underlines rather than obscures most of the film's visual pleasures, reminding us (if we'd managed to forget) just how glorious L. Frank Baum's strange world is.
GOOD The blend of old-fashioned, classic storytelling with cutting-edge technology is undeniably enthralling.
GOOD Hey, Dorothy actually has freckles in IMAX. Glinda's floating sphere is mesmerizing. The flying monkeys are creepier than ever. The Lollipop Guild even more disturbing - are these guys having a seizure?
GOOD Any reason to show your children "The Wizard of Oz" on a big screen seems like a good one.
GOOD The best thing about 3D glasses is that they keep your kids from seeing your tears of sentimental joy at this gorgeous restoration
GOOD This phantasmagorical fantasy really does represent old-school MGM filmmaking at its best.
GOOD It is one of the greatest movies ever made, and even today it stands the test of time as a quality family flick.
GOOD Even decades later, one of the best family films ever made.
GOOD A head trip of a family film.
GOOD The moment Judy Garland starts singing in that barnyard, we're all six years old again, with nothing left to do but join her.
GOOD It's more than a movie; it's an American rite of passage. [Blu-ray]
GOOD If through some incredible chance you haven't [seen it], all I can say is: do so immediately. Make this the very next movie you watch. Literally.
GOOD One of only a handful of films that nearly everyone is familiar with.
GOOD The songs and magic are still fresh, even if it isn't quite knowing enough, perhaps, for today's young audiences.
GOOD The greatest children's movie of all time. Probably.
GOOD This 3D remastering of the original, on a giant Imax screen to boot, brings a whole new sense of wonder to Dorothy's yellow-brick road movie.
GOOD I'll see you on the dark side of the moon...and your little dog, too!
BAD Cute but uneven. Best for dog lovers.
FAIR If you've followed the previous Shiloh films, then you'll be satisfied, if not overjoyed, by this final chapter.
BAD If you are new to the series, I would suggest your starting with the original Shiloh, so far, the best in show.
BAD Offers exactly what you've come to expect from the series: Bland but wholly innocuous family entertainment featuring a cute kid and an even cuter dog.
FAIR Wilson ... makes this film, via grit of detail, a bit more than a Hallmark Special Retro Disney Walton sermon in values.
BAD Boring as porridge.
BAD An OK kids movie passing through on the way to video.
BAD You won't find the pragmatic intelligence of Naylor's original stories here, but even cynics may be touched by the film's remarkably wholesome lessons about friendship, family and forgiveness.
GOOD It's a family film that deals with real problems and teaches real values, and yet is exciting and entertaining.
BAD If Sandy Tung's film had flavor, it might taste like a week-old bagel.
FAIR Saving Shiloh is touching, intelligent and admirably thoughtful.
BAD ... has more respect for the intelligence of the title dog than its audience.
BAD Two major issues here: The boy, Marty (Jason Dolley), is a patronizing do-gooder, and the dog, a beagle-looking fella, doesn't do much that's special.
FAIR On its own merits, has some very fine cinematic flourishes... if we can but manage the herculean feat of separating it from the older movie.
BAD 1985 sequel to American classic is tin-eared and creepy.
FAIR Best to see them as individual films with nothing in common apart from source material, one a classic, the other a strong enough picaresque amongst some decent fabulation.
FAIR There are some fine, Oscar-nominated special effects, but the excitement just isn't there.
GOOD A forgotten classic.
FAIR I can see why the Judy Garland fans might not appreciate this weird little adaptation, but it's actually pretty good!
BAD Director Walter Murch tries to infuse the story with the inventiveness and adventure of the Star Wars saga, but the results are disappointing.
GOOD Faithfully brings the Oz books to life. A classic.
BAD The work of ingenious technicians who seem either not to know what gave the original film its magic, or not to care.
FAIR Return to Oz is hardly as kid-friendly as The Wizard of Oz, but older children with a taste for the fantastic will find it interesting. Adult Oz fans will find it entertaining as well.
BAD Should've stuck to that yellow brick road
FAIR An underrated little romp, surprisingly faithful to L. Frank Baum's atmosphere... though obviously it's all overshadowed by that other Oz flick.
FAIR The further adventures of immigrant mice.
FAIR What can you say about a sequel that comes five years later and yet feels rushed?
BAD Our sweet little Fievel has been stricken with a case of sequelitis ... but it's not too bad.
GOOD The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, featuring his heroic man-and-dog duo, Wallace and Gromit, is Park at his sublimely silly best.
GOOD Park and co have shaped a wonderfully warm and fuzzy family adventure out of old horror clichA (C)s.
GOOD Instead of vainly pursuing today's latest trends, only to see them turn into tomorrow's embarrassments, Park and co. fall back on the values of the past, preferring substance and craft to the fleetingly voguish.
GOOD It's a one-joke premise, but part of Nick Park's madness/genius is the skill and detail with which he approaches it.
FAIR With Were-Rabbit, Mr. Park establishes Gromit as the best animated canine character since Snoopy.
GOOD Full of the British wit and kinetic action-movie thrills that have made Nick Park's cartoons so popular.
FAIR ...cute and pleasant (yet essentially forgettable)...
FAIR click to read review [Greek]
BAD It's a surprising misstep from the people who gave us Chicken Run.
GOOD The comedy is never indulged at the expense of the plot, which flies off in genuinely unexpected directions, culminating in a boundlessly inventive funfair chase sequence.
GOOD I don't see how anyone who enjoys their animated movies won't enjoy all of this one.
GOOD Gromit...could teach ninety percent of the actors working today something. He can say more in a glance than most actors can using their entire range of tools.
GOOD Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is an inventive pseudo-thriller in the Claymation style.
GOOD An unqualified success.
GOOD This might be Plasticine's finest hour.
GOOD Taken as a whole, this is a superb film and an astonishing technical achievement.
FAIR The script this time is really better than the animation and the result is genuinely funny. This is an animated film, but it aims to please the whole family and its aim is good.
GOOD [Not] merely one of the best animated films of the year; it's the best, and further, ranks among 2005's most satisfying cinematic experiences.
GOOD A delight for the kids and well set to take classic status.
GOOD Cheeky and inventive, it's the perfect Halloween movie for the kids! Or as they say, it's the world's first vegetarian horror movie.
GOOD It doesn't feel produced; it feels made.
GOOD It deserves to be the biggest thing in animated features since Shrek and quite possibly Toy Story.
FAIR The first two acts of the movie are actually solid, filled with vintage W&G moments as well as some stunning animation.
GOOD It's a ripping good yarn, to boot, breathlessly paced and seamlessly edited, but most important, resoundingly and surpassingly fun.
GOOD Park and Box make this 85 minute film feel like a half hour with its quick moving plot line, making it perfect for children.
GOOD It is suitable for any child who can follow a complicated story -- although there are some scary bits -- and it is equally appealing to the child hiding in any adult.
GOOD There is something indescribably satisfying about the vaguely off-kilter world of Wallace and Gromit and its litany of details.
FAIR There's none of the Hollywood cynicism or too-clever winks meant to instill a sense of exclusive superiority, just a sincere celebration of what makes good filmmaking and a desire to entertain.
GOOD It is funny, exciting, and it's a fantastic piece of animation.
FAIR Go for the beginning and the end and try to endure the middle.
GOOD A polarizing, but classic piece of children's entertainment filled with whimsy, horror, comedy and imagination.
GOOD This is Gene Wilder's legacy. He was perfect for the role, and it was his mixture of childlike wonder and bitter, deserved vengeance that made the character so compelling.
GOOD Pure, sweet imagination for both kids and adults.
BAD The passages in the mysterious factory, which should be Charlie's and our release from the oppression of the earlier scenes, are just as ugly as everything that's come before, so there's no contrast.
GOOD ...filled with good humor, good acting, and good songs...and it's just off kilter enough to keep everyone's attention.
GOOD Ainda que um ou outro numero musical comprometa o ritmo, o clima de fantasia e a atuacao calorosa de Wilder conquistam o espectador.
GOOD The movie bursts with creativity, deep thought and comedy.
GOOD Probably Gene Wilder's finest, most manic hour.
GOOD Weird and wonderful
GOOD Just a frolicking Wonka visionary schnozberry flavored delight!
FAIR It has a huge following, though I've never understood why.
FAIR If "creepy" can be an asset, then this is the best kind of creepy you'll ever find.
GOOD A timeless family film that will continue to endure as long as people love chocolate.
GOOD The original feel good film from 1971, is back in a special new DVD edition for its thirtieth anniversary with some great special features.
GOOD Brings joy to adult and child alike.
FAIR The zany factory's imaginative gimmicks, and that vivid color scheme, will keep even the youngest kids alert.
FAIR OK slapstick in the "Home Alone" vein
BAD Hey, at least the baby wasn't talking.
FAIR Tot-sized laughs
BAD For the seven people out there who hoped for a movie stupider than "Home Alone 2."
BAD A shockingly crass grab for holiday pocket money that's both infantile and endlessly patronising.
BAD A re-hash of tired cliches and CGI effects.
BAD That the lead character is a 'male cow' complete with udders shows how confused the picture is.
FAIR A beatifully animated simple but fun plot, carries enough giggles for all age groups.
BAD The animation is perfectly colorful and the voice actors earn their paychecks, but it's blatantly obvious that this thing started production without a screenplay -- and hit the screens without a plot.
BAD Deserves to be hanging in the nearest meat locker.
BAD This could be the film that snaps everyone's patience with Hollywood animations which have a Dell computer chip where their heart should be.
BAD There are far better ways of keeping the kids happy.
FAIR Good voice talent and some funny moments.
BAD It's impossible to shake the impression that Barnyard was written by idiots. Why else would the male cows have udders?
BAD The design is uninteresting, the characters are bland and the story is terrible.
BAD Strictly for kids, and, as the three or four people who saw Oedekerk's previous directing effort, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist, can attest, the writer/director tends to stretch even throwaway jokes minutes past the punch line.
FAIR Ben the Cow (the voice of Sam Elliott) has to teach his carefree son Otis (Kevin James) the responsibility of leadership over the farm animals. This is far from Otis' mind, but inevitable. Barnyard is a farm version of The Lion King with eno
FAIR There is a nice mix of humour and pathos here. Barnyard may not be all that exceptional, but it is quite satisfying.
BAD Not good enough for even a rental, this 'Barnyard' should be burned for fear of mad cow disease
BAD Barnyard doesn't know if it wants to be another tiresomely 'hip' piece of post-Shrek postmodernism or a comfortably traditional kids' movie that delivers family values without the self-conscious smirk.
BAD Could cause more gender confusion than 'Transamerica.'
FAIR All the cows have udders - even the male ones. In real life, only female cows have udders. What kind of sick, alternate cow universe does this movie take place in anyway?
BAD Barnyard is a one-note premise that falls flat after about 10 minutes.
BAD "Barnyard" doesn't stink. But it's not the cream of the crop, either.
BAD The funniest joke is the one nobody talks about: the gender confusion of male cows with udders.
BAD Barnyard isn't a complete waste of time, it's just too familiar.
BAD A Lion King clone that's tailored to the Fisher-Price crowd.
BAD With shamefully obvious nods to the father/son sentimentality of traditional Disney 'toons and even an awkward love interest, Barnyard is a mishmash of modern cartoon cliches.
BAD With 'Barnyard,' the androgynous udders, as annoying as they can be, are about the only original thing to be found in the whole movie.
BAD never really amazing enough to separate it from the rest of the herd of great animation that we've seen this summer.
BAD [W]hy do the male cows have udders?.. This isn't supposed to be the animated version of TransAmerica.
BAD doesn't just violate the audience's right to entertainment, it violates animal dignity to such an extent that PETA might want to consider getting involved
BAD The CG animation looks like rubbery plastic instead of animals, and much of it is spent on jokes related to derrieres and hindquarters.
BAD Lesbian Cows!!! Lesbian COWS!!!! Carnivorous LESBIAN COWS!!!! Aarg!
BAD There's barely enough of a story to sustain a short film, much less a feature.
BAD Forget the confusion of the he-cows that populate the film; the real problem is that Barnyard is just a lousy, lousy movie.
BAD Udderly ordinary.
BAD Nearly every joke lays an egg.
BAD your kid won't learn anything from Barnyard, but they might need 10 years of therapy after viewing the movie's fight scenes and COYOTES ATTACKING THE FARM.
BAD Laughter comes from the movie's absurdity, not its comedy.
BAD Other than confusing children, it's hard to know what the inane, tedious, mean-spirited Barnyard is trying to do.
FAIR The value of a film like Space Buddies... is whether you can watch it and enjoy it with your kids. And the answer to this question is a resounding yes.
FAIR One small step for dogkind, one cute adventure for kids.
