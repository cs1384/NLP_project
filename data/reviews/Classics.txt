0.87 <|###|> Dreyer goes to the Christian heart of the matter in this film. Damned powerful.
1.0 <|###|> Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1943 parable about witch-finding and witch-burning in 17th-century Denmark is coldly brilliant.
1.0 <|###|> A compelling family melodrama and a sombre exploration of how men co-opt religious dogma to oppress and punish female desires.
1.0 <|###|> Day of Wrath is probably the simplest of the Dreyer films that I've seen, but it is still a great work.
1.0 <|###|> Dreyer was a master of conveying emotion in a way that can only be called "literary"
1.0 <|###|> A study of good and evil, repression and oppression, sexuality and guilt, Day of Wrath is a truly spiritual film.
