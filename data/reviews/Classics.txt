GOOD Dreyer goes to the Christian heart of the matter in this film. Damned powerful.
GOOD Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1943 parable about witch-finding and witch-burning in 17th-century Denmark is coldly brilliant.
GOOD A compelling family melodrama and a sombre exploration of how men co-opt religious dogma to oppress and punish female desires.
GOOD Day of Wrath is probably the simplest of the Dreyer films that I've seen, but it is still a great work.
GOOD Dreyer was a master of conveying emotion in a way that can only be called "literary"
GOOD A study of good and evil, repression and oppression, sexuality and guilt, Day of Wrath is a truly spiritual film.
GOOD A savage attack on American comfort.
GOOD functions equally well as revenge drama, moral fable, and no-holds-barred condemnation of dog-eat-dog capitalism
FAIR Dassin's film emerges as a rather searing, wide-reaching indictment of the necessary evils of doing business in the United States
GOOD Dassin swathes Thieves' Highway's long-haul boys in claustrophobic compositions and menacing darkness.
GOOD There has never been a picture like David O. Selznick's production of Gone With the Wind.
GOOD Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh create their own sizzle as Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara in a lavish four-hour epic that juxtaposes scenes of jaw-dropping majesty with moments of elegant intimacy and playful verbal jousting.
GOOD No one watches Gone with the Wind for historical accuracy. What keeps us coming back is four-hours of epic romance in gorgeous Technicolor.
FAIR Too clumsy a thing to be taken seriously, with its romanticisation of slavery and its problematic approach to rape, Gone With The Wind is nevertheless a work of considerable power.
GOOD Running to nearly four hours and boasting at least three directors, this epic American Civil War romantic drama is more of a symbol of the Hollywood studio system than a mere movie.
FAIR The performances of eternally glittering movie stars Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable ... exist in a league of their own, demanding rapt attention in scene after scene.
GOOD Ginormous in both scale and emotional wallop, MGM's epic is still a cinematic event to be savoured.
GOOD Brimming with colour and passion, it pulls its emotional kick from tremendous performances, not least from Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable as the love-hate lovers.
FAIR The golden standard for classic Hollywood bombast, this one.
FAIR If ever the phrase, "They don't make 'em like they used to" could fit a film, this is it.
GOOD The epic film that to this day stands as the benchmark against which all other epics are judged.
GOOD Gone with the Wind is still dated, but it's a dynamite kind of antiquity.
GOOD It's impossible not to be carried away by the rich arterial force of this storytelling.
GOOD Grand old Hollywood at its most magnificent and melodramatic. Say what you like about the soapy characterisation and plotting, the spectacle flattens all in its wake.
GOOD A lost Hollywood art: the epic melodrama.
GOOD Terrificly acted, staged and designed, Gone WIth the Wind remains one of the greatest period epics ever filmed.
GOOD Despite the star power of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, Wind has lost some of its bluster, yet it survives as a glorious Technicolored window into America's dusty, bygone past.
GOOD It's so full of iconic moments of plotting and dialog that a feature film could be edited just out of the most quotable moments.
GOOD ...producer David O. Selznick's crowning achievement and a film that stands up as one of the screen's finest classics.
GOOD One of the classic films that defined American cinema, Gone With the Wind is a rare example of a collaboration involving hundreds of talents and egos that turned out great.
GOOD Never, never bores me. Glabe is fabulous!
FAIR Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara remain the greatest pairing of irresistible force and immovable object in Hollywood romance.
GOOD Treat yourself to one of the greatest cinematic experiences ever created.
GOOD The brilliant epitome of corporate filmmaking.
GOOD Often, older movies are a bit naive and unthreatening, but this movie is surprisingly fierce and somber.
GOOD Mind-boggling for the first time in a theater. Too bad that many, like me, see it first on TV.
GOOD It could be -- and should be -- viewed from a dozen different perspectives, but it is, above all, a story about adapting to the most challenging circumstances possible.
GOOD Clear an evening and indulge yourself in one of the few films that can justifiably be called an epic.
GOOD The best remembered and most publicized film in Hollywood's flamboyant history, the biggest of David O. Selznick's grand obsessions, and quite probably the most beloved movie of all time.
GOOD The passionate saga of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, played out against the flaming red backdrop of the Civil War, generates enough romance, historic drama and deep emotion to fuel a dozen great films.
GOOD Everything about it is big.
GOOD Victor Fleming's 60-year-old movie looks like it was shot this year.
FAIR People who actually recall 1942 will more greatly appreciate the waves of nostalgia that bathe this affectionate coming-of-age drama, set on a tiny island off New England.
FAIR In the early hijinks phase, the film seems like a dry run for Porky's, but it later gets into the business of fluttering curtains, walks on sandy beaches and longing glances.
GOOD "Summer Of '42" is an unforgettable meditation on sexual awakening and loss during WWII.
FAIR "Summer of '42" is a memory movie, written, directed and acted with such uncommon good humor that I don't think you'll be put off by its sweet soft-focus, at least until you start analyzing it afterwards.
GOOD One of the cinematic coming-of-age stories that started a trend.
FAIR Nostalgic coming-into-manhood fantasy.
FAIR Nostalgia is used as a distancing device -- to keep us safely insulated from the boy's immediate grief, love, and passion.
BAD Dates very badly indeed
FAIR It's apparent in every scene that this is a highly personal film for screenwriter Raucher, and the nostalgia is so palpable that it nearly slides off the screen.
BAD Lacking the faith in God and Hollywood kitsch that motivated Cecil B. DeMille, Ridley Scott's modern-day Bible epic is much less gripping than any movie with plagues of frogs and boils ought to be.
FAIR There's no arguing the immensity of it or the beauty of its visual images. But what's around the many show-stopping moments is too generic to send us out of the theater properly awestruck, reverent and wowed.
BAD I found myself longing for the clarity of Darren Aronofsky's recent Noah, which acknowledged the insane implications of its story by putting rock monsters (fallen angels!) on the screen.
FAIR Exodus: Gods and Kings is by no means a perfect film. But it's a very good film with exceptional devotion to craft, which is more than can be said for many other Bible-themed movies, which often favor accuracy over artistry.
BAD It's a story that has been told and retold for thousands of years, but this po-faced, dutifully spectacular retelling barely lingers in the memory beyond the end credits.
BAD Walk on the bland side in a comic book of biblical proportions.
BAD This sour Moses - whose visions come after a biff on the head - emerges as a certifiable lunatic who gets lucky with a few meteorological, geographical and zoological anomalies.
FAIR Despite the always-commanding Bale as Moses, the emotional side of this story is lacking.
FAIR Ridley Scott's biblical epic "Exodus: Gods and Kings" is by turns fascinating and infuriating, exciting and tedious, head-scratching and inspiring.
BAD Yes, there is spectacle, although the initially promising parting of the Red Sea is almost drowned by waves of climactic silliness.
FAIR The excitement is dampened by a draggy middle where Moses gets married and a tedious epilogue, but Scott's keen ability to explain scripture miracles in credible terms is this biblical blockbuster's major asset.
FAIR Ultimately, it's a determinedly un-ironic biblical epic which may have no time for laughs but shows a keen capacity to tell a decent story well.
BAD The assortment of four credited writers charged with getting Exodus whipped into shape did an alarmingly terrible job of it.
BAD It's sad to say that the most interesting aspects of this film don't actually occur on the screen.
FAIR From a visual perspective, Scott has created a picture that, at times, can take your breath away, but he loses sight of the more intimate, idiosyncratic elements that should elevate and humanise this narrative.
FAIR In a world still being torn apart by religious conflict, the film does have a resonance beyond the grand visual sweep that Scott can always be relied upon to deliver.
BAD Just another disappointingly so-so Scott production - more Kingdom of Heaven than Gladiator.
FAIR Exodus feels like a missed opportunity.
GOOD Trust Ridley Scott to give us a bold, revisionist take on the foundation story of three major world religions.
FAIR Whether it's Ramses losing half his army in a horrific landslide or vast, sweeping panoramas of the Pharaoh's Egypt in all its blood-built glory, Exodus is an entertainment of the first order.
BAD the film's racial issues only make it seem that much leaden, unimaginative, and old-fashioned
FAIR Scott once seemed divine. Look on [Exodus], ye mighty, and despair.
FAIR Aside from impressive 21st century digital effects, this new take on the Moses story pales in comparison to Cecil B. DeMille's iconic 1956 version, The Ten Commandments, which is far more resonant and intensely dramatic.
FAIR It's in the spectacle elements that Scott's film thrives, and of his recent big-budget mediocrities, Exodus is probably the best.
BAD How do you screw up the parting of the Red Sea? How does Ridley Scott?
BAD Production Stands Tall, Story Washed Out
BAD Exodus frequently feels like it is running down a checklist of scenes and events rather than telling a natural story.
BAD The film's emotional component hinges on Moses leaving his wife and young son for a long and dangerous journey. But what you'll remember best is all the smiting.
BAD His direction snaps to life in the big moments, which have an energy and drive missing from the rest of the movie.
BAD Even Christian Bale's noteworthy performance can't save the fact that Exodus: Gods and Kings never finds a proper pace thanks to its offbeat storytelling.
GOOD 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' is spectacular.
FAIR Ridley Scott only barely manages to pull this off by playing the spectacle card with 'Exodus: Gods and Kings.'
FAIR Former actor Don Taylor directs smoothly and efficiently and elicits fine performances from the cast.
FAIR Passable entertainment, but it's no fun watching the likable, witty Cornelius and Zira become hairy martyrs.
FAIR the film is a highly satisfying mix of satire and suspense
FAIR One of the better new movies in town, and better in a genre -- science-fiction -- that at the crucial middle level where the history of movies is made, if not written, has recently been not so much bad as invisible.
FAIR The last of the "Ape" sequels that's worth watching.
FAIR Possibly the least of the series, but certainly not a predictable sequel.
GOOD Oneof the best of the bunch!
BAD feels like a quickie insert that is needed to progress the larger narrative, but doesn't have enough meat on it to deserve its own film
FAIR Brings just enough of a twist to the series' conventions.
FAIR The best of the all of the sequels.
FAIR It works fairly well as the central movie of the franchise but will have little to offer non-devotees.
FAIR Regarded by some as the best of the Planet of the Apes sequels, maybe even on a par with the 1968 Charlton Heston original itself, this third Apes movie breathes fresh air into [the] series.
FAIR A fascinatingly disjointed hybrid of Western and combat film.
GOOD One of Leone's best movies -- and one of his looniest, which may be exactly why it's one of the best.
GOOD Not exactly classic Leone, but enjoyable nonetheless as many of the great elements are in place: maverick heroes, action, and Ennio Morricone music.
BAD The idiosyncrasies are there, all right, but they have never seemed less interesting.
FAIR Well-plotted action, but as in most of Leone's films scenes seem to have been deleted from the American prints.
GOOD Woefully overlooked... Top-tier widescreen action... Ennio Morricone's enchanting score and Leone's trademark flourishes handshake in wild agreement. Sucker punches its way to the top of the Italian-western mountains.
GOOD Features one of the most glorious and unforgettable scores by Leone's composer, Ennio Morricone.
GOOD Seventy-five years on, it hasn't dated in the slightest.
GOOD The central themes of illusions, dreams and going on an extraordinary adventure all the better to come home and appreciate what you have there are enduring.
GOOD One of Hollywood's quintessential productions, this musical adaptation of L Frank Baum's classic fable is probably the most beloved fantasy film of all time and the ultimate family picture.
GOOD This family classic long ago left the realm of being mere entertainment to emerge as a cultural touchstone for generations of Americans.
GOOD The Wizard of Oz is the cinematic equivalent of high-end wine, in that it gets better with age. The difference is that while wine must remain unopened to increase in value, the film positively thrives on it being tasted and shared over and over and over.
GOOD MGM's fantastic IMAX 3D conversion for the The Wizard of Oz's 75th anniversary underlines rather than obscures most of the film's visual pleasures, reminding us (if we'd managed to forget) just how glorious L. Frank Baum's strange world is.
GOOD The blend of old-fashioned, classic storytelling with cutting-edge technology is undeniably enthralling.
GOOD Hey, Dorothy actually has freckles in IMAX. Glinda's floating sphere is mesmerizing. The flying monkeys are creepier than ever. The Lollipop Guild even more disturbing - are these guys having a seizure?
GOOD Any reason to show your children "The Wizard of Oz" on a big screen seems like a good one.
GOOD The best thing about 3D glasses is that they keep your kids from seeing your tears of sentimental joy at this gorgeous restoration
GOOD This phantasmagorical fantasy really does represent old-school MGM filmmaking at its best.
GOOD It is one of the greatest movies ever made, and even today it stands the test of time as a quality family flick.
GOOD Even decades later, one of the best family films ever made.
GOOD A head trip of a family film.
GOOD The moment Judy Garland starts singing in that barnyard, we're all six years old again, with nothing left to do but join her.
GOOD It's more than a movie; it's an American rite of passage. [Blu-ray]
GOOD If through some incredible chance you haven't [seen it], all I can say is: do so immediately. Make this the very next movie you watch. Literally.
GOOD One of only a handful of films that nearly everyone is familiar with.
GOOD The songs and magic are still fresh, even if it isn't quite knowing enough, perhaps, for today's young audiences.
GOOD The greatest children's movie of all time. Probably.
GOOD This 3D remastering of the original, on a giant Imax screen to boot, brings a whole new sense of wonder to Dorothy's yellow-brick road movie.
GOOD I'll see you on the dark side of the moon...and your little dog, too!
GOOD The pre-noir gangster genre was in many ways defined by the innovative approaches taken by Hawks in this film.
GOOD The greatest gangster movie of the 1930s -- and that means the greatest ever.
GOOD [The police chief] endorses the myth of the west while conceiving the urban gangster as a rat-like menace.
GOOD Completely relevant: Citizens complain that access to technologically more efficient guns is partly to blame for the crime wave; they fret over illegal immigrants; they worry that the 'new breed' of criminal is more uncivilized than its predecessor...
GOOD Atmospheric, mesmerising and darkly humourous with a sizzling script and cast. This is a true classic of its genre.
GOOD Paul Muni goes way over the top as Tony Camonte, painting a picture of a gangster who knows nothing but excess, and who will stop at nothing to get his way.
GOOD The slaughter in Scarface, the Shame of a Nation, the Howard Hughes gangster production... is like that of a Shakespearean tragedy
GOOD Hawks displays balls of steel, using the filmic medium to challenge the free reign of mobsters in the 1930's.
GOOD The quintessential crime thriller. One of the few perfect films.
GOOD The quintessential classic gangster picture.
GOOD a potent, uncompromising and de-romanticized portrait of the gangster life
GOOD Scarface is unquestionably one of the greatest talking American movies ever made, and has been terribly underrated all through this century.
GOOD One of Hawks's undisputed masterpieces, and a landmark in the screen depiction of gangsters.
FAIR Unnecessary sequel is nonetheless entertaining; Roddy Mcdowall back in simian shape.
BAD Aside from Severn Darden, who relishes his lip-smacking heavy character, the cast seems disinterested; even series stalwart Roddy McDowall looks bored.
GOOD An okay finale.
GOOD surprisingly entertaining
BAD Battle looks like the last gap of a dying series, a movie made simply to wring the dollars out of any remaining ape fans.
BAD The bluntest, cheapest and worst of the 'Apes' movies.
GOOD Schmaltzy doesn't get much better...
BAD The battle was lost several movies earlier.
FAIR Fans will enjoy it, but the "Apes" gang could have done a little better. Not surprisingly, this was the fifth and last installment. (Unless you count the TV show...)
BAD At least it is only 83 minutes long.
BAD The Planet of the Apes series started well, and gradually decreased in budget and quality. By Battle the budget is all but gone, and all the believability and excitement has gone with it.
FAIR The only film in the series to end on a positive note.
BAD [For] completists only and definitely counts as the worst in the entire series.
GOOD A polarizing, but classic piece of children's entertainment filled with whimsy, horror, comedy and imagination.
GOOD This is Gene Wilder's legacy. He was perfect for the role, and it was his mixture of childlike wonder and bitter, deserved vengeance that made the character so compelling.
GOOD Pure, sweet imagination for both kids and adults.
BAD The passages in the mysterious factory, which should be Charlie's and our release from the oppression of the earlier scenes, are just as ugly as everything that's come before, so there's no contrast.
GOOD ...filled with good humor, good acting, and good songs...and it's just off kilter enough to keep everyone's attention.
GOOD Ainda que um ou outro numero musical comprometa o ritmo, o clima de fantasia e a atuacao calorosa de Wilder conquistam o espectador.
GOOD The movie bursts with creativity, deep thought and comedy.
GOOD Probably Gene Wilder's finest, most manic hour.
GOOD Weird and wonderful
GOOD Just a frolicking Wonka visionary schnozberry flavored delight!
FAIR It has a huge following, though I've never understood why.
FAIR If "creepy" can be an asset, then this is the best kind of creepy you'll ever find.
GOOD A timeless family film that will continue to endure as long as people love chocolate.
GOOD The original feel good film from 1971, is back in a special new DVD edition for its thirtieth anniversary with some great special features.
GOOD Brings joy to adult and child alike.
FAIR The zany factory's imaginative gimmicks, and that vivid color scheme, will keep even the youngest kids alert.
GOOD Rough and grim knuckle-fighting drama headlining Charles Bronson.
GOOD Walter Hill's first film as a director is spare, elegiac and as tough as a nickel steak.
BAD ...a decidedly underwhelming entry within Kubrick's increasingly spotty body of work...
GOOD By a whopping margin, this is Kubrick's most radical film and greatest dramatic gamble.
GOOD The blackest black comedy ever made by a major Hollywood studio, and one of the funniest handful of films made in English.
GOOD Because of its uncanny insight and frighteningly prescient satirical edge, Dr. Strangelove is a document of its time and also timeless. It held onto its relevancy by being bitter, cynical, and thinking absolutely the worst of people.
GOOD Dr Strangelove is one of Stanley Kubrick's many masterpieces, one of the greatest films about the Cold War and one of the greatest comedies ever made.
GOOD Black comedy Kubrick classic for smart teens+.
GOOD It's easily one of the director's best films of his somewhat controversial career.
GOOD Dr. Strangelove's status as the movie that confirmed both Stanley Kubrick's reputation and the arrival of beat-sick irreverence can no longer be retracted.
GOOD Kubrick nos presenteia com uma perola de humor negro que critica acidamente as guerras e a mediocridade dos homens por tras destas.
GOOD It's as startling today as it was then. Catch it now before it becomes too relevant to be funny again.
GOOD Sound funny? It is.
GOOD Endures as one of the finest political satires.
GOOD It still features Peter Sellers' finest three performances as well as proving that the supposedly humourless Kubrick was up for a laugh.
GOOD This landmark movie's madcap humor and terrifying suspense remain undiminished by time.
GOOD Stanley Kubrick's 40-year-old satirical polital-comedy about the end of the world is especially disturbing as one ponders world events at present.
GOOD The paradigm of all end-of-the-world political thrillers and a part of the American vernacular.
GOOD Is Dr. Strangelove Kubrick's best movie? Along with Paths of Glory, absolutely.
GOOD Kubrick's great 1964 tragicomedy about superpowers on the nuclear brink continues to fascinate new generations of moviegoers, as its frequent reissues attest.
GOOD A masterpiece of satire, paranoia and straight comedy. One of the all-time classics with a great cast and many memorable moments. Sellers is magnificent.
GOOD If there never were another satire of war, you'd think this one would have single-handedly stopped the whole mad business.
GOOD Frightening, hilarious -- and indelible.
GOOD Masterful and highly original
FAIR ...still shocking in its giggly nihilism.
GOOD Masterpiece
GOOD Easily classifiable as one of the top ten films of all time.
GOOD Hysterically funny cold war satire. Peter Sellers' triple role is the crowning touch. One of Kubrick's greatest films.
GOOD The shameful, criminal wrongs depicted in this document from the past are with us today.
GOOD An absolutely hilarious and brilliant satire in which Kubrick's assured and precise direction serves, for once, to make an incredibly entertaing film as well as a smart one.
GOOD The final word on the Cold War... the defining text on a subject so overwhelmingly horrible that all you can do is laugh.
GOOD Stanley Kubrick's best film. A perfect satire.
GOOD One of the greatest films ever made.
GOOD A Duck Soup for the Cold War era.
GOOD The film is always saying something, and a viewer would have to be deaf and blind not to recognize the targets of the sarcasm.
GOOD Dr. Strangelove (1964) is filled with great comic performances.
GOOD This marriage of indelible imagery with electric, seemingly incongruous pop songs wouldn't be bettered until, well, the next time Scorsese decided to do it.
GOOD Features an attention-grabbing performance by Robert De Niro, but I maintain that Harvey Keitel's excellent central performance has always been critically undervalued.
GOOD Authentic in feel and immensely personal in subject matter, Mean Streets marked the arrival of one Martin Scorsese and his unique brand of urban filmmaking.
GOOD showcases Scorsese's artistic strengths and weaknesses as they stood at the outset of his career
GOOD The movie's blazing energy is still astounding; the verite street-scenes are terrific and Scorsese's pioneering use of popular music is genuinely thrilling.
GOOD A tight, intense masterpiece from Scorsese, writing collaborator Mardik Martin and the iconic stars.
GOOD The film feels authentic, the characters are true, the situation hopeless
BAD Doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid.
GOOD Terrific. Top shelf talent at the top of their game, working immediately before they would change Hollywood.
GOOD Scorsese's first masterpiece is still gripping.
GOOD One of cinema's finest moments....you'll never forget it
GOOD Perfected here are Scorsese's patented slow-motion cutaways, combination pan/tracking shots, ingenious use of pop music, and impromptu bloodbaths
GOOD The Godfather made the mob glamorous. Mean Streets made it real. Martin Scorsese's ferocious, grimy 1973 classic is just as good as Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, but it shows us criminal life lower down the food chain.
GOOD ...a gritty, one-of-a-kind, unromantic, down-and-dirty look at the streets of New York like no film had portrayed those streets and their people before.
GOOD Without exaggeration, you could make an argument for Mean Streets being the most influential film of the last fifty years.
GOOD The hilarious scene in which Charlie and Johnny Boy argue about Johnny Boy's debts in the backroom of a bar (a scene that was improvised) is alone worth the price of admission.
GOOD No matter how bleak the milieu, no matter how heartbreaking the narrative, some films are so thoroughly, beautifully realized they have a kind of tonic effect that has no relation to the subject matter.
GOOD One of Scorsese's true classics.
GOOD A true rough diamond, Scorsese's breakthrough may be uneven, but at its heart lies fledgling genius.
GOOD Its greatness lies in its leanness, with nary a word, a move, a gesture that's nonessential.
GOOD A ferociously original film.
GOOD One of those movies that you should see, even if it is only to watch a masterful director's first superior film.
GOOD Everyone involved brings a near-dizzying rhythm to this quintessential 'New York movie' and its collection of outsider-characters, all intoxicated on themselves.
GOOD In countless ways, right down to the detail of modern TV crime shows, Mean Streets is one of the source points of modern movies.
BAD Gimmicky sci-fi, outer space B-flick.
BAD Very bad special effects mar this only-average s-f excursion. Only the giant rat-bat-whatever creature has any flair.
BAD They don't make 'em like this anymore. It's easy to see why.
GOOD The Panic in the Needle Park rolls up the drug culture's sleeve and picks at the scabs underneath.
FAIR An occasion to meditate upon the frightfulness of heroin addiction and why many youth opt for the euphoria of white powder rather than the promises of the American dream.
FAIR More a character study than any kind of narrative story, it's moderately worthwhile but far from a classic.
GOOD Alem de contar com as estupendas atuacoes de Winn e Pacino (em sua brilhante estreia no Cinema), este ainda e um dos melhores filmes ja produzidos sobre dependencia quimica.
GOOD It is not filled with quick cutting or gimmicky editing, but Jerry Schatzberg's direction is so confident that we cover the ground effortlessly.
GOOD Its politics are abhorrent to me, but my god, it's such a slick, well-crafted thriller ... that I can't hate it
FAIR A tense thriller that holds your attention to the very end. The film is aided by one of Bernard Hermann's better scores.
BAD Tedious remake of a "thriller" that wasn't that thrilling to begin with
GOOD Keep-you-up-all-night terrifying!
FAIR The remake with De Niro had the most to fear from this superior little thriller!
GOOD A classic revenge thriller.
GOOD works best as a twisted nail-biter, punctuated brilliantly with an apocalyptic score by Bernard Herrmann
