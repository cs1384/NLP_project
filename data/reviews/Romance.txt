0.875 <|###|> Lukas Moodyson's debut feature has a grainy, immediate feel that nicely enhances the story's emotional honesty -- a quality that our own popular teen movies have only just begun to embrace.
0.8 <|###|> Nobody can deny the honesty or the outright sincerity this film has.
0.75 <|###|> Dahlstrom and especially Liljeberg are first-rate.
0.875 <|###|> Unfortunately, as the plot develops, it shies away from exploring that discontent, in favor of demonstrating precisely the kind of naivete and sweetness that one would expect to find in any teen romance.
0.875 <|###|> It's just an incredibly insightful character drama about true, awkward, beautiful first love, and it's all the better for it. Oh, and that last shot is as cute as it gets.
0.75 <|###|> High school, small town, teenagers in hormone hell -- or is that heaven?
0.9 <|###|> A completely charming reality-based romantic fantasy, both sweet-natured and sympathetic.
0.75 <|###|> The movie is funny, gentle, and true.
0.5 <|###|> The film has some charm and a winning simplicity but not an iota of depth.
0.5 <|###|> I'm tired of teens talking about make-up and making out. A lesbian twist to an otherwise standard story just isn't enough to make it compelling.
0.75 <|###|> Successfully captures the frenzied angst and boredom of youth, as well as the powerful, unbridled emotions of first love.
0.8 <|###|> A poignant exploration of the cruelty and anguish of teenage existence.
1.0 <|###|> Right away this film grabs attention with documentary-style close- ups and upends teen movie cliches.
0.8 <|###|> Incredibly fun, incredibly entertaining, and worth watching in all respects.
0.8 <|###|> A breath of fresh air in a genre too often controlled by Hollywood teen-pap.
0.875 <|###|> One of the most honest and heartfelt teen dramas ever to grace the screen.
0.87 <|###|> Dreyer goes to the Christian heart of the matter in this film. Damned powerful.
1.0 <|###|> Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1943 parable about witch-finding and witch-burning in 17th-century Denmark is coldly brilliant.
1.0 <|###|> A compelling family melodrama and a sombre exploration of how men co-opt religious dogma to oppress and punish female desires.
1.0 <|###|> Day of Wrath is probably the simplest of the Dreyer films that I've seen, but it is still a great work.
1.0 <|###|> Dreyer was a master of conveying emotion in a way that can only be called "literary"
1.0 <|###|> A study of good and evil, repression and oppression, sexuality and guilt, Day of Wrath is a truly spiritual film.
0.2 <|###|> Things are so cheap they didn't even spring for uniforms for the so-called cops; everybody seems to be wearing their street clothes.
0.75 <|###|> The unusually subtle yet eloquent debut of Israeli director Haim Tabakman...
0.75 <|###|> The movie respects the Jewish tradition of inquiry and debate; it unreels as a sort of dramatic dialogue that acknowledges the benefits and terrors of both religious fundamentalism and personal freedom.
0.6 <|###|> This restrained piece from first-time Israeli film-maker Haim Tabakman explores the tension between faith and sexuality in Jerusalem.
0.6 <|###|> The simplicity of the tale is its strength and the acting of Zohar Strauss as Aaron and Ran Danker as Ezri is entirely natural.
0.9 <|###|> It's almost impossible to imagine anyone making a gay romance between two orthodox Jews. And yet this film is subtle and sensitive, and full of earthy honesty as it explores a seriously difficult situation.
0.75 <|###|> A sensitively directed and movingly acted story of forbidden love.
0.8 <|###|> A very human story quietly unfolds with a compelling understatement in this dour but deeply-felt drama from director Haim Tabakman.
0.6 <|###|> This is responsible, restrained and intelligent, but if anything, the risky subject material is handled with too much caution.
0.2 <|###|> Director Haim Tabakman avoids sensationalism so assiduously that his film has slightly less eroticism than the average party political broadcast.
0.8 <|###|> It's not just the subject matter of impossible love that recalls Brokeback Mountain, but the same aching sadness and pathos.
1.0 <|###|> One of the best and most moving love stories you'll ever see. Absolutely top draw.
0.6 <|###|> Tabakman makes evocative use of enclosed spaces and silences, and tempers the melodrama with a sociological authenticity that confirms the centrality of belief in Jewish culture.
0.8 <|###|> Slow and often silent, it's an extraordinarily disciplined film that respects, if not honours, the milieu of its story...
0.4 <|###|> Worthy in theme, honourable in intent, oddly bloodless in execution.
0.6 <|###|> Director Haim Tabakman conjures up the sad mood very skilfully, with natural lighting, measured pace and an unexpected electronic soundtrack. In fact, it's probably my favourite film about the romantic love between two Jewish guys since Superbad.
0.6 <|###|> The film's urgent point about the need for understanding is made with dignity and an appreciable tinge of sorrow.
0.6 <|###|> Impressively directed, thought-provoking and emotionally engaging drama that plays like an orthodox Jewish version of Brokeback Mountain, though the pacing and minimalistic dialogue might prove too arthouse for some tastes.
0.875 <|###|> As oblique and laconic as its characters, Tabakman's moral tale rises to a melancholy spirituality.
0.9 <|###|> "Brokeback Mezuzah": Tender, affecting, brave, and beautifully wrought,
0.825 <|###|> Brave, provocative and gently engrossing with well-nuanced performances.
0.9 <|###|> It moves slowly and patiently through the ordeal of a single soul, illuminating in the process a cosmos of intense and hidden feeling.
0.625 <|###|> Quiet, sober and tense, the movie makes some interesting points, but it lacks the emotional firepower of Brokeback Mountain.
0.6 <|###|> The drama's moments of inspiration vindicate its desultory proceedings.
0.6 <|###|> Haim Tabakman's feature directing debut fascinates for the powerful, multi-layered themes that percolate beneath its visually spare and delicately told story.
0.8 <|###|> Unusually sensitive look into the hearts of nonconformists in an extremely conforming community as the different risks they take and the choices they make are quite moving.
