GOOD Brilliant anime.
GOOD Earth versus Heaven is always an interesting conflict, but it's seldom looked so beautiful.
FAIR a visually extravagant, exhilarating explosion of animation that makes absolutely no sense
FAIR The spectacular artwork and animation go a long way toward keeping the audience captivated.
BAD In a movie that is deadly serious, the stilted dialog provides unexpected sources of mirth.
