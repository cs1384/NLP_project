BAD There's zero tension in Bishop Young's story, as every crisis on his path is easily solved with a gentle montage of scriptural consultation and hugs all around.
GOOD Holy Rollers looks slick for a documentary, and despite utilizing the talking heads-style approach, it does so with an eye for interesting composition.
BAD The final chapter in The Bible Collection, a series of films that, stylistically, has been all over the map. With this, the series ends not with a bang, but a whimper.
FAIR Best enjoyed as a sample of the state of the art circa 1925, not as a timeless masterpiece.
FAIR Yes, you'll also find the chariot race in here, and you may even find it as exciting or more exciting than the one Heston enacted.
FAIR Hokey by today's standards, but one of the greatest silent film spectacles.
GOOD Has merits not found in William Wyler's Oscar-laden 1959 remake.
GOOD Knock-out courtroom drama has deft comic touches.
GOOD Stagey yes, but powerful Tracy and March acting + subject matter make this a must see.
GOOD Absorbing, if long-winded courtroom drama bolstered by two fine central performances from Tracy and March.
GOOD An all time classic
BAD Director Kramer at his most unbearably high-minded and ostentatious
GOOD Extraordinarly vivid, rich, and wise about the core questions of how we know and who we are.
FAIR A most worthwhile film, if for no other reason, because it provides a great opportunity to watch Tracy and March go at it in a most entertaining fashion.
FAIR Producer-director Stanley Kramer ably handles the incendiary material visually, making good use of deep focus and careful compositions
GOOD Inherit the Wind is well crafted and can entertain even the most jaded of modern audiences.
FAIR Schaedler's film raises as many questions as he answers.
FAIR This incisive film -- which opens with rare footage of angry monks throwing stones at Chinese troops -- nicely resists and complicates simpler views of the storied land.
