0.8 <|###|> Words on the screen, their power to free you, and also entrap you - if this isn't the internet's deadly blessing, what is?
0.6 <|###|> Having recently released documentaries on clerical abuse, Mario Cuomo, Park Avenue, Lance Armstrong and, now, WikiLeaks, Gibney seems in danger of becoming an actualite machine.
0.8 <|###|> Outstanding, cool-headed documentary.
0.8 <|###|> A breathless, dazzling and mind-blowingly complex 130-minute story.
0.8 <|###|> I'd have liked to know more about his private life and background but Gibney has too much other ground to cover.
0.8 <|###|> We Steal Secrets is much concerned with conspiracy theories and may well wind up fuelling new ones.
0.6 <|###|> A thorough and decently intentioned work, though it accepts a little too glibly the more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger line against Assange: that he is a fascinating radical who simply became a paranoid authoritarian.
0.7 <|###|> With a subject matter that oddly feels both timely and out-of-date, this documentary is packed with telling details about WikiLeaks, Although it gets muddy as it delves into the lives of founder Julian Assange and whistleblower Bradley Manning.
0.8 <|###|> This is saying something important. Check your Facebook settings.
0.8 <|###|> This is an expertly organised documentary; Gibney's always are.
0.8 <|###|> In truth, there's little in Alex Gibney's film that won't be familiar to attentive news watchers, but this skilled documentarian has mastered the art of condensing a vast and complex amount of information into a gripping and entertaining package.
0.8 <|###|> This thorough, engrossing film shows how idealistic Aussie hacker Julian Assange took on the might of the US, exposing their military and diplomatic misconduct, then allowed his own murky personal life to tarnish his credibility.
0.8 <|###|> The range of Gibney's subjects, the rigour of his research and the complexity of his questions make We Steal Secrets breathlessly compelling, but it's the moments of psychological probing that haunt the most.
0.8 <|###|> Noxious government activities may warrant exposure, but Gibney points out that the whistleblowers can be pretty flawed too.
0.8 <|###|> Alex Gibney adds to his forensic examinations of Enron and Abu Ghraib with another fine documentary.
0.8 <|###|> A thoughtful documentary about Julian Assange, Bradley Manning, secrets, lies, power and the poorly understood nature of the internet.
0.9 <|###|> If you're looking for a really comprehensive, clear, evenhanded and thoroughly entertaining examination of, well, the story of WikiLeaks, master documentarian Alex Gibney has gone to the trouble of providing you with one.
0.8 <|###|> A fascinating insight into Wikileaks and the two men behind the world's largest ever whistleblowing scandal.
0.8 <|###|> This look at WikiLeaks -- and founder Julian Assange -- makes its case long before the film stops talking.
0.8 <|###|> It portrays a seething nest of highly volatile personalities whose motivations are fraught with ambiguities and contradictions, and a chain of actions and reactions the full impact of which has yet to be measured.
0.8 <|###|> Alex Gibney's film is an absorbing examination of the world's most infamous information portal.
0.75 <|###|> Which is the real Assange? This movie cannot say. It's as if Gibney threw up his hands, put the whole mess in the audience's lap and said, "Here, YOU figure this guy out."
0.875 <|###|> Sometimes it takes a feature-length documentary to stitch together a story we think we already know.
0.875 <|###|> Smart and opinionated, it's a great introduction to this ongoing story.
0.875 <|###|> A real-life cyber-thriller with real-life consequences, Alex Gibney's We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks is a riveting and revelatory documentary ...
0.875 <|###|> Gibney builds a remarkable level of suspense, given how exhaustively WikiLeaks has been covered in the media.
1.0 <|###|> Engaging, kinetic, revelatory and unexpected.
0.8 <|###|> At once an awkward mingling of two complex life stories and a gripping, necessary look at how information is gathered, shared and, yes, stolen.
0.875 <|###|> Who is "We" in the title We Steal Secrets? There's no need for a spoiler alert, but it's neither Gibney nor Assange.
0.75 <|###|> Despite its wonky-Washington theme, We Steal Secrets ends up being a surprisingly soulful and, yes, even moving story of hubris, good intentions and mistakes.
0.72 <|###|> The film is fascinating and provocative, deftly navigating complex personalities and shifting allegiances.
0.875 <|###|> The movie's especially deft at exposing spin, whether it's the US media's or Assange's.
0.75 <|###|> A fascinating account of a man who loved stirring the pot until he was the one sitting in it.
0.8 <|###|> Gibney has created one of the signature discussions on the signature debate of the post-9/11 information-security age, namely: Who needs to know?
0.5751000000000001 <|###|> It doesn't offer any new or surprising information or any profound analysis, so it barely scratches the multifaceted surface of Assange and remains slightly undercooked.
0.4 <|###|> This movie has confirmed my suspicion that people need to leave Hunter S. Thompson's story alone for a while.
0.77 <|###|> Gonzo's brilliance is in showing Thompson warts and all, without taking anything away from his greatness even as it shows his many deficiencies.
0.9 <|###|> Alex Gibney's documentary about bad boy journalist Dr. Hunter S. Thompson is both a memorial exaltation and a lament. Gibney's masterful style balances verite and dramatic effect. He doesn't doesn't tell you what to think, but spurs you to think.
0.8 <|###|> A definitive, accessible, even inspiring screen biography put together with thought and vitality.
0.6666666666666666 <|###|> The film's plea that we need Thompson now more than ever is a little misty-eyed: Thompson's day was long gone by the time he put a gun to his head.
0.9 <|###|> Much like the man himself, it's quite a piece of work.
0.8 <|###|> Gonzo is much more than a tribute to a maverick and genuine pioneer. It's a lament for the gaping hole that Thompson left behind. The only obvious weakness is Gibney's reluctance to engage fully with Thompson's toxic personal life.
0.6 <|###|> This documentary about his life by Alex Gibney, though entertaining in many ways, is oddly uninterested in his strengths or otherwise as a writer, the very gift for which Thompson earnestly wished to be known.
0.6 <|###|> Director Alex Gibney has plundered 200 hours of audiotapes, hundreds of photos and personal testimony from an impressive roster of Thompson's colleagues and family to put together an even-handed portrait.
0.6 <|###|> A straight-line journey through the good doctor's loopy myth and madness, but one that doesn't push far enough into uncharted territory. Fine as a primer, but Gibney leans more towards admiration than examination.
0.6 <|###|> The film is content to laugh affectionately at Thompson's bad boy exploits, giggle at the impatience of a man who went hunting boar with a sub machine-gun.
0.4 <|###|> This soft-headed hagiography is a disappointment, and at least half an hour too long.
0.8 <|###|> Gibney says the film took so much out of him that he limped into the Sundance Festival with a ruptured disc, a green liver and spots in his eyes that will not disappear. I hope he now thinks it worth the trouble. I'm pretty sure watchers will.
0.8 <|###|> Superbly directed, hugely entertaining documentary that's a treat for both newcomers and aficionados of Thompson's work.
0.9 <|###|> With a wealth of archive material, documentary filmmaker Gibney assembles a remarkably astute and comprehensive look at the life of one of the most notorious journalists in American history.
0.8 <|###|> a seminal work of talking head biography
0.8 <|###|> Gonzo is an excellent reminder that Thompson was more than just a wild man. He was, at least for a time, a first-rate writer who covered his times and helped shape them.
0.6 <|###|> [Gibney] is never quite able to get beyond the familiar in order to give viewers a new and penetrating look at the subject of Thompson and his work.
0.5 <|###|> Too much time in this overly long film is spent on minutiae.
0.875 <|###|> The rare documentary that puts you in a headlock to pin you to your seat, Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson is a bracing masterpiece.
0.8 <|###|> Gibney thus has to negotiate a treacherous path. Its easy to romanticize a larger-than-life personality like Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, gonzo journalist, and it makes for compelling viewing. However, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, gonzo journalist, was not exactly
0.6 <|###|> The movie is full of itself and fun but nonessential.
0.6 <|###|> I wanted more unearthed footage. But if you are looking for a tribute to the man, you won't find anything better.
1.0 <|###|> Filmmaker Alex Gibney had access to those who knew the guy, the famous, the infamous and the obscure, and he paints a picture of a serious journalist who saw himself documenting 'the death of the American Dream.'
0.75 <|###|> As informative as parts of it are, the movie is not nearly as colorful as longtime Aspen, Colo., resident Thompson.
0.75 <|###|> In the manner of such key Thompson works as 'Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72,' the movie links entertaining personal biography with fascinating cultural history...
0.85 <|###|> As a diverting documentary, Gonzo lives up to its subject matter - it is indulgent and witty, filled with a thousand little insights and ultimately sad. Thompson seemed obscure to his family, cartoonishly overblown to his friends.
0.75 <|###|> Far more insightful than typical rose-colored-glasses eulogizing, the subjects are as brutally honest about Thompson's successes and shortcomings as Thompson was as a writer.
0.6 <|###|> Gonzo director Gibney frees himself from the heady topicality of his recent documentaries...and dives right down into the deep -- and dark -- end.
0.625 <|###|> [Director] Gibney assembles a wealth of Thompson memorabilia and first-person interviews for this often insightful and sometimes overly indulgent chronicle.
0.8 <|###|> Reading his books will give you better insight, but it's hard to imagine a better primer into Thompson's outlaw life.
0.625 <|###|> I was curious to see why we needed a two-hour documentary about the three-hit wonder who cast away his career halfway through life and coasted on celebrity status for 30 years. After seeing Gonzo, I'm still not convinced we do.
0.75 <|###|> An amused and affectionate look at the writer who formed a crucial link between the New Journalism of the 1960s and today's blogosphere.
0.625 <|###|> At its worst, the film takes a long detour into Thompson's admiration for an utterly banal 1974 Carter speech (The Powerful were sticking it to The People again) as a way to make us feel virtuous, political and leftish.
0.75 <|###|> Thompson created a rebellious niche for himself in a business that more often than you might think channels its writers into conformist routine.
0.7 <|###|> It's nice to be reminded, as Shakespeare taught us, that truth comes from the most unexpected places, even the booze-ree
0.5 <|###|> If you really want to understand and appreciate [Thompson], you'd be better off reading his books.
0.75 <|###|> Neatly balancing full-hearted celebration with evenhanded examination.
