GOOD Words on the screen, their power to free you, and also entrap you - if this isn't the internet's deadly blessing, what is?
FAIR Having recently released documentaries on clerical abuse, Mario Cuomo, Park Avenue, Lance Armstrong and, now, WikiLeaks, Gibney seems in danger of becoming an actualite machine.
GOOD Outstanding, cool-headed documentary.
GOOD A breathless, dazzling and mind-blowingly complex 130-minute story.
GOOD I'd have liked to know more about his private life and background but Gibney has too much other ground to cover.
GOOD We Steal Secrets is much concerned with conspiracy theories and may well wind up fuelling new ones.
FAIR A thorough and decently intentioned work, though it accepts a little too glibly the more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger line against Assange: that he is a fascinating radical who simply became a paranoid authoritarian.
FAIR With a subject matter that oddly feels both timely and out-of-date, this documentary is packed with telling details about WikiLeaks, Although it gets muddy as it delves into the lives of founder Julian Assange and whistleblower Bradley Manning.
GOOD This is saying something important. Check your Facebook settings.
GOOD This is an expertly organised documentary; Gibney's always are.
GOOD In truth, there's little in Alex Gibney's film that won't be familiar to attentive news watchers, but this skilled documentarian has mastered the art of condensing a vast and complex amount of information into a gripping and entertaining package.
GOOD This thorough, engrossing film shows how idealistic Aussie hacker Julian Assange took on the might of the US, exposing their military and diplomatic misconduct, then allowed his own murky personal life to tarnish his credibility.
GOOD The range of Gibney's subjects, the rigour of his research and the complexity of his questions make We Steal Secrets breathlessly compelling, but it's the moments of psychological probing that haunt the most.
GOOD Noxious government activities may warrant exposure, but Gibney points out that the whistleblowers can be pretty flawed too.
GOOD Alex Gibney adds to his forensic examinations of Enron and Abu Ghraib with another fine documentary.
GOOD A thoughtful documentary about Julian Assange, Bradley Manning, secrets, lies, power and the poorly understood nature of the internet.
GOOD If you're looking for a really comprehensive, clear, evenhanded and thoroughly entertaining examination of, well, the story of WikiLeaks, master documentarian Alex Gibney has gone to the trouble of providing you with one.
GOOD A fascinating insight into Wikileaks and the two men behind the world's largest ever whistleblowing scandal.
GOOD This look at WikiLeaks -- and founder Julian Assange -- makes its case long before the film stops talking.
GOOD It portrays a seething nest of highly volatile personalities whose motivations are fraught with ambiguities and contradictions, and a chain of actions and reactions the full impact of which has yet to be measured.
GOOD Alex Gibney's film is an absorbing examination of the world's most infamous information portal.
FAIR Which is the real Assange? This movie cannot say. It's as if Gibney threw up his hands, put the whole mess in the audience's lap and said, "Here, YOU figure this guy out."
GOOD Sometimes it takes a feature-length documentary to stitch together a story we think we already know.
GOOD Smart and opinionated, it's a great introduction to this ongoing story.
GOOD A real-life cyber-thriller with real-life consequences, Alex Gibney's We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks is a riveting and revelatory documentary ...
GOOD Gibney builds a remarkable level of suspense, given how exhaustively WikiLeaks has been covered in the media.
GOOD Engaging, kinetic, revelatory and unexpected.
GOOD At once an awkward mingling of two complex life stories and a gripping, necessary look at how information is gathered, shared and, yes, stolen.
GOOD Who is "We" in the title We Steal Secrets? There's no need for a spoiler alert, but it's neither Gibney nor Assange.
FAIR Despite its wonky-Washington theme, We Steal Secrets ends up being a surprisingly soulful and, yes, even moving story of hubris, good intentions and mistakes.
FAIR The film is fascinating and provocative, deftly navigating complex personalities and shifting allegiances.
GOOD The movie's especially deft at exposing spin, whether it's the US media's or Assange's.
FAIR A fascinating account of a man who loved stirring the pot until he was the one sitting in it.
GOOD Gibney has created one of the signature discussions on the signature debate of the post-9/11 information-security age, namely: Who needs to know?
BAD It doesn't offer any new or surprising information or any profound analysis, so it barely scratches the multifaceted surface of Assange and remains slightly undercooked.
BAD This movie has confirmed my suspicion that people need to leave Hunter S. Thompson's story alone for a while.
FAIR Gonzo's brilliance is in showing Thompson warts and all, without taking anything away from his greatness even as it shows his many deficiencies.
GOOD Alex Gibney's documentary about bad boy journalist Dr. Hunter S. Thompson is both a memorial exaltation and a lament. Gibney's masterful style balances verite and dramatic effect. He doesn't doesn't tell you what to think, but spurs you to think.
GOOD A definitive, accessible, even inspiring screen biography put together with thought and vitality.
FAIR The film's plea that we need Thompson now more than ever is a little misty-eyed: Thompson's day was long gone by the time he put a gun to his head.
GOOD Much like the man himself, it's quite a piece of work.
GOOD Gonzo is much more than a tribute to a maverick and genuine pioneer. It's a lament for the gaping hole that Thompson left behind. The only obvious weakness is Gibney's reluctance to engage fully with Thompson's toxic personal life.
FAIR This documentary about his life by Alex Gibney, though entertaining in many ways, is oddly uninterested in his strengths or otherwise as a writer, the very gift for which Thompson earnestly wished to be known.
FAIR Director Alex Gibney has plundered 200 hours of audiotapes, hundreds of photos and personal testimony from an impressive roster of Thompson's colleagues and family to put together an even-handed portrait.
FAIR A straight-line journey through the good doctor's loopy myth and madness, but one that doesn't push far enough into uncharted territory. Fine as a primer, but Gibney leans more towards admiration than examination.
FAIR The film is content to laugh affectionately at Thompson's bad boy exploits, giggle at the impatience of a man who went hunting boar with a sub machine-gun.
BAD This soft-headed hagiography is a disappointment, and at least half an hour too long.
GOOD Gibney says the film took so much out of him that he limped into the Sundance Festival with a ruptured disc, a green liver and spots in his eyes that will not disappear. I hope he now thinks it worth the trouble. I'm pretty sure watchers will.
GOOD Superbly directed, hugely entertaining documentary that's a treat for both newcomers and aficionados of Thompson's work.
GOOD With a wealth of archive material, documentary filmmaker Gibney assembles a remarkably astute and comprehensive look at the life of one of the most notorious journalists in American history.
GOOD a seminal work of talking head biography
GOOD Gonzo is an excellent reminder that Thompson was more than just a wild man. He was, at least for a time, a first-rate writer who covered his times and helped shape them.
FAIR [Gibney] is never quite able to get beyond the familiar in order to give viewers a new and penetrating look at the subject of Thompson and his work.
BAD Too much time in this overly long film is spent on minutiae.
GOOD The rare documentary that puts you in a headlock to pin you to your seat, Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson is a bracing masterpiece.
GOOD Gibney thus has to negotiate a treacherous path. Its easy to romanticize a larger-than-life personality like Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, gonzo journalist, and it makes for compelling viewing. However, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, gonzo journalist, was not exactly
FAIR The movie is full of itself and fun but nonessential.
FAIR I wanted more unearthed footage. But if you are looking for a tribute to the man, you won't find anything better.
GOOD Filmmaker Alex Gibney had access to those who knew the guy, the famous, the infamous and the obscure, and he paints a picture of a serious journalist who saw himself documenting 'the death of the American Dream.'
FAIR As informative as parts of it are, the movie is not nearly as colorful as longtime Aspen, Colo., resident Thompson.
FAIR In the manner of such key Thompson works as 'Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72,' the movie links entertaining personal biography with fascinating cultural history...
GOOD As a diverting documentary, Gonzo lives up to its subject matter - it is indulgent and witty, filled with a thousand little insights and ultimately sad. Thompson seemed obscure to his family, cartoonishly overblown to his friends.
FAIR Far more insightful than typical rose-colored-glasses eulogizing, the subjects are as brutally honest about Thompson's successes and shortcomings as Thompson was as a writer.
FAIR Gonzo director Gibney frees himself from the heady topicality of his recent documentaries...and dives right down into the deep -- and dark -- end.
FAIR [Director] Gibney assembles a wealth of Thompson memorabilia and first-person interviews for this often insightful and sometimes overly indulgent chronicle.
GOOD Reading his books will give you better insight, but it's hard to imagine a better primer into Thompson's outlaw life.
FAIR I was curious to see why we needed a two-hour documentary about the three-hit wonder who cast away his career halfway through life and coasted on celebrity status for 30 years. After seeing Gonzo, I'm still not convinced we do.
FAIR An amused and affectionate look at the writer who formed a crucial link between the New Journalism of the 1960s and today's blogosphere.
FAIR At its worst, the film takes a long detour into Thompson's admiration for an utterly banal 1974 Carter speech (The Powerful were sticking it to The People again) as a way to make us feel virtuous, political and leftish.
FAIR Thompson created a rebellious niche for himself in a business that more often than you might think channels its writers into conformist routine.
FAIR It's nice to be reminded, as Shakespeare taught us, that truth comes from the most unexpected places, even the booze-ree
BAD If you really want to understand and appreciate [Thompson], you'd be better off reading his books.
FAIR Neatly balancing full-hearted celebration with evenhanded examination.
BAD It is a huge missed opportunity on Crowe's part. In his attempt to show the best traits of a band he is obviously very enamored with, he's wound up with a pretty lackluster film.
GOOD Very few music documentaries in the history of the form have more successfully conveyed the inner workings and outer artistic expression of a band than Cameron Crowe's brilliant Pearl Jam Twenty.
FAIR [Crowe] merely wants to capture the personalities, the songs and the shows.
FAIR With noticeable gaps between the telling of its first decade and its second, Pearl Jam Twenty didn't necessarily need to be a feature, but is a really lovely fan letter to a band that's worked hard for the devotion and respect it receives.
FAIR With its intimacy and (this can't be emphasized enough) fantastic sound, Pearl Jam Twenty is like two hours spent rediscovering the band through excellent headphones.
BAD If only it was about something other than rockers almost irked they got famous.
FAIR In a better film, Crowe would have played journalist instead of fan boy.
FAIR By the time "Pearl Jam Twenty" is over we can't help but be impressed by the kind of personal and professional integrity that has kept the band honest and allowed them to endure and prosper.
FAIR While the movie may not have the insight of D. A. Pennebaker's "Don't Look Back" or even Phil Joanou's U2 travelogue, "Rattle and Hum," Pearl Jam devotees will not go home musically unnourished.
GOOD If Pearl Jam Twenty has its share of hyperbole, it's leavened with humor, self-deprecating commentary, and a deep-pockets budget's worth of great clips.
GOOD A great introduction to the band as well as a great recap for the fans who have been there all along the way.
GOOD For the biggest fans, it may be the single best movie going experience you will have this year
BAD Cameron Crowe's chronicle of the Seattle grunge quintet's first two decades is undeniably thorough - even offshoot Temple of the Dog gets the spotlight - but it's also weirdly self-aggrandizing.
FAIR Any enterprise like this is inherently self-congratulatory, but the film is best considered from Crowe's perspective: that of a fan.
FAIR A loving, gracefully crafted retrospective that shrewdly eschews Behind the Music conventions at most turns.
FAIR Despite surrendering to sentimental fandom, Crowe thoughtfully touches on greyer areas...
FAIR Entertaining, well made documentary that's a treat for fans thanks to its wealth of rarely seen footage and newly filmed interviews...
FAIR The music's the thing and Crowe lets it rip.
BAD Vedder is charming, his band rather bland. As trips down memory lane go, it's a bit of a trudge.
FAIR Fans will love this energetic documentary tracing more than two decades of the infamous grunge band. But while the film is packed with terrific footage, it's too worshipful for non-fans to take seriously.
BAD A deadly combination of fanboy, friend, and Richie Cunningham, Crowe has zero objectivity about the band
FAIR You may not want to hang around [Hunter S. Thompson] all the time, but he would be a pretty interesting guy to have over for breakfast.
GOOD ...wildly entertaining...
FAIR Do we get to know the real Hunter through viewing Breakfast with Hunter? Possibly. More than ever before, at least.
GOOD Breakfast With Hunter is a cinematic exploration that is perhaps the closest you can get to Hunter Thompson without scoring an invite up to the 'fortified compound'.
FAIR Takes a peculiarly predictable and conventional approach to its study of the godfather of gonzo journalism, Hunter S. Thompson
BAD Curiously prosaic for the wicked incisiveness of its subject.
GOOD Ever wish you could see what goes on behind those famed, heavily fortified walls of Owl Farm? Here's your invitation.
FAIR "The Barefoot Bandit" never coalesces into a complete portrait of a fascinating figure, but it has its moments of difficult truth.
FAIR ...a fascinating dossier, even if the protagonist remains somewhat an enigma. Or perhaps because of it, "The Barefoot Bandit" makes a case for a modern-day folk hero.
FAIR The hit-and-run effect sometimes suggests a documentary equivalent to slam dancing, but without the bruises.
GOOD AmericanHardcore ! Aboutboredstupidyouth! Didn'tliketheNewWave ! Gomoshin'fortruth ! Can'tfindtruth ! Can'tfindgrace ! SettleforHenryRollins! Punchin'dudesintheface !
FAIR While this documentary features rare performance footage of hard-core punk-rock bands Black Flag and Bad Brains, it's not exactly the best-assembled or deepest cinematic exploration of the subject.
FAIR ... an enjoyable if incomplete nostalgia trip.
FAIR Rachman's concert footage confirms that the music was unique: bruising, chaotic and blisteringly electric.
FAIR "American Hardcore" harkens back to the time when punk rockers were actual punks, not whining, prefabricated MTV pretty boys.
FAIR Crammed with grainy, shot-on-the-fly mid-Eighties video footage, recent interviews, and a genuine love for its subject, American Hardcore encapsulates a largely forgotten moment in maximum rock & roll history.
FAIR American Hardcore, Paul Rachman's impressively thorough documentary, tells of the second-generation punk rockers who learned from the Sex Pistols and Ramones and then did their DIY thing.
FAIR American Hardcore gets what most music lovers could not at the time: Sometimes, that noise in your head and that anger in your heart just has to get out, and there's always a guitar around somewhere.
BAD For the record, Rachman's punk-rockology has its cracks. While he worships at the altar of Henry Rollins and Black Flag, he excludes such key West Coast bands as X and the Dead Kennedys.
BAD Instead of an insightful look at disaffected youths finding an outlet for angry energy in rock rages, American Hardcore is a slanted history lesson coming solely from its subjects.
BAD What's irritating about the movie is how much time it spends on empty nostalgia -- shouldn't real punks scorn reminiscing? -- and how little time it spends truly exploring the roots of America's punk prime in the early 1980s.
BAD Hardcore could have done with a little more self-criticism instead of self-congratulation, a little more outside commentary as opposed to inner-circle ramblings.
FAIR Leaves little doubt that this truly was one of the wildest eras in rock.
BAD You can come away feeling bruised and half-deaf.
FAIR An energetic and grandly entertaining tribute to a short-lived period of early-'80s punk rock.
FAIR The movie is hazy about dates and names but bracing in its depiction of young people who made music because they loved it, not because they thought it would make them rich or famous.
FAIR Exhaustive and at turns exhausting, American Hardcore explores 1980s punk subculture with the frenetic energy of mile-a-minute mosh-pit music, sealed with a fist.
FAIR A better doc about punk music would contextualize the genre in the industry and interview kids who cried 'No!' when their parents told them to turn down that racket.
FAIR A reverential but knowledgeable documentary about an aggressive offshoot of punk that flourished on the Left Coast from 1980-86, with outposts in such far-flung locales as Washington, D.C., New York, Boston, Detroit, Chicago and Austin, Tex.
BAD There's a lot of interesting material here, but Rachman doesn't offer any real analysis of his own, and the film suffers from a lack of narrative focus.
GOOD A brilliant grassroots take on the humble beginnings and eventual demise of a musical movement that ultimately had far more impact than it would have ever imagined.
FAIR The film's a pretty good scrapbook ... and it evinces a healthy cranky-old-man disgust with the mega-platinum punk acts of today.
FAIR If you're going to make a movie about hardcore punk, make a movie about hardcore punk.... [This] looks more like the same old PBS documentary.
FAIR Though American Hardcore doesn't achieve a cogent and authoritative history, it succeeds in giving the general impression of the early-'80s hardcore punk scene.
FAIR ... starts promisingly but quickly settles into a repetitive pattern of talking heads repeating the same mantra, interspersed with brief clips of barely visible old film footage.
FAIR This is the 80's like you have never seen them, brilliantly brought back to life in this fascinating new film.
BAD Only if you LOVE hardcore punk is the movie worth a damn
FAIR Almost anyone who's had enough of the purposeless, processed pop that passes for entertainment today will nod their heads in emphatic agreement with what the film says -- when you're not covering your ears, anyway.
FAIR The documentary is an enlightening journey to a dark corner of contemporary punk's dank little basement.
FAIR If it all goes by too fast, and leaves you with a headache when it's done -- well, wasn't that the point all along?
BAD The film features virtually no commentary from anyone who wasn't part of the original scene and who might put hardcore into a larger cultural context, and ends up an intermittently interesting laundry list of same-sounding bands.
FAIR It's an expansive look at a genre and a tribe of musicians that found their collective voice. And there's one thing you could always say about hardcore -- it was never boring.
FAIR Inspired by a book by Steven Blush, Rachman deftly sketches the hardcore scene in a dozen cities and chronicles the growing violence that signaled its demise.
FAIR The resourceful film will stir up a mosh pit of appreciation among aficionados while providing an intriguing, if not always compelling, overview for those less acquainted with the music.
FAIR Punk rock was never about sonic perfection: It was (and is) about emotional intensity, and American Hardcore has that in van loads, and delivers with onetwothreefour! power.
BAD For music that is loud, fast, angry, and in-your-face, the film's low-key tone and pace is more suitable for a PBS fund-raising drive.
FAIR tells you everything you need to know about how vital this music was
GOOD Sebring's drifting tone might leave you bemused, but take it as it comes and it's a captivating insight into modern music's godmother.
BAD For all its transient black-and-white beauties, denies its subject the sort of solid context that would reveal the scale of her achievements. A patchy, frustrating, though loving tribute.
FAIR An extraordinarily intimate portrait of an extraordinary woman, Dream of Life charms despite being filmed through a sycophantic haze.
GOOD While it fails to place Smith's work and her significance in context, the film certainly captures her charisma, wit and passion.
FAIR There are flashes of insight and genuinely moving moments in this long, meandering, wildly indulgent movie record of poet and singer-songwriter Patti Smith.
FAIR Smith, an eloquent subject with a wry view on her life, generously pays tribute to such influential mentors as Dylan, Burroughs and Ginsberg. Her fans should be entranced.
BAD Succeeds in making the 109 minute running time feel like at least eight of the eleven years he took to shoot the film.
FAIR That spirit of encountering the world with undying artistic curiosity -- and without a plan -- informs Dream of Life, a drifting portrait of Smith.
BAD If you don't already own "Horses," this movie will make you want to go out and buy it. You'll also want to start surfing the Internet to fill in the blanks that Dream of Life fails to include.
GOOD There's a note of mourning in this otherwise celebratory film -- for punk rock, for New York, for reality, for a time when popular music was animated by something other than money.
FAIR Heavy on the gabba-gabba, light on the hey!
FAIR Gets extra credit for trying something different.
FAIR Dream of Life barely hints at the transformational energy that Smith exudes in person, but it does paint a portrait of a defiantly creative life.
FAIR Dream of Life takes a while to find its rhythm but once it does, it's riveting stuff.
FAIR Patti Smith: Dream of Life, fashion photographer Steven Sebring's impressionistic study of the most influential of punk poets, disarms and charms with its honesty.
FAIR Insufferable, endearing, pretentiously arty, bracingly direct, humorless, hilarious, oddly distant and strangely touching, but always compulsively watchable -- in other words, a fabulous contradictory mess, much like Smith herself.
FAIR Thanks to its meandering, achronological structure, we don't learn too many specifics of Smith's brilliant career, and only a die-hard fan will find all of it vitally interesting.
FAIR I imagine you could call Dream of Life a loving meditation on a one-of-a-kind performer. And you don't have to be a Smith fan (I am one, by the way) to enjoy.
FAIR Few documentaries about living artists get as deep into their subject's brain and heart as this one about the rock priestess and poetess.
BAD The opportunity to introduce newbies to a serious music-world icon -- and her significance -- feels squandered.
FAIR Even the crudest punk rocker learned three chords (Smith brags of having five) before they plugged in an amp. Steven Sebring would have done better to have had a few lessons in editing and structure before picking up his camera.
FAIR Probably could have cut out 15 to 20 minutes without losing anything, but if you're even remotely interested in this fascinating and enigmatic artist or the influence she's had on the world of rock, then you might want to check it out.
GOOD A lovely, drifty first feature that feels less like a documentary and more like an act of rapturous devotion.
BAD a schizophrenic case study
FAIR A series of elegiac episodes from the life and mind of the fantabulous rock n' roll chanteuse and poetess.
FAIR Some might confuse Zenovich's indictment on the judge as a cop-out in judging Polanski. But the facts remain. There's no further insight into the heinous crime. Nor is there a new judgment to be passed on the man who committed it. Anyone looking for new r
GOOD "Zenovich's film is a fair and skillful chronicling of the Roman Polanski case, and a study of how the circumstances of celebrity influence the carrying out of justice in the U.S. It's not an in-depth study of the filmmaker's psychology nor of how his lif
GOOD While not apologising for his disgusting behaviour, the film puts Polanski's actions in the context of a turbulent life.
GOOD an essential entry in Hollywood's cultural chronicle
GOOD Mesmo tendo criado uma narrativa envolvente, coesa e impecavel a ponto de servir como base para os advogados de Polanski solicitarem o arquivamento do caso, este documentario foi ignorado pela Academia. Arre.
GOOD This chronicle of Polanski's life, career and legal woes offers an engaging portrait of the artist.
GOOD It's the sort of complex story Polanski himself would have excelled at telling, if he weren't busy living it.
FAIR Though Marina Zenovich's film deals with the notorious case of the film director who pleaded guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old, the film's real subject is the California legal system turned upside down by celebrity and media pressure.
GOOD Meticulously crafted and keenly thought out, the film also serves as a useful historical document. It illuminates its time period, delves into moral hypocrisy and shows the evolution of muck-raking celebrity journalism.
BAD With a subject like Roman Polanski, you don't really need to do much to capture audience interest. But maybe that's the reason Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired doesn't live up to its promise.
GOOD Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, a documentary by Marina Zenovich that is also a first-rate work of reportage, makes a forceful case that the whole truth of the matter was never heard in court and Polanski was more sinned against than sinning.
FAIR I found myself occasionally enthralled, mainly due to Polanski's haunted presence coming through, even in the form of an absent ghost.
BAD Roman Polanski (The Pianist, Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown) is unquestionably a great filmmaker, but as Marina Zenovich's documentary Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired perhaps unintentionally demonstrates, he's also a creep.
FAIR She has achieved extraordinary access to the other still-living players in the case, and they all seem to be in agreement: Polanski is correct in saying the judge played with him as a cat might play with a mouse.
GOOD This is a superb picture, sharp, open-minded, wised-up and cinematically accomplished. I wonder if any man could've handled the Polanski enigma with the same ironic intelligence [Marina] Zenovich has.
GOOD A clever, contemplative kind of courtroom drama that utilizes the best of Hollywood filmmaking style to tell a story so strange, it must be true.
GOOD Using tons of footage and new interviews with the victim and key legal figures -- but not the subject himself -- director Marina Zenovich shows how Polanski's darker urges were matched on a moral level by others involved in the case.
FAIR Zenovich has made a feature worthy of its eccentric and reckless central figure at his most cynical and embittered.
GOOD None of the interviewees in Marina Zenovich's fascinating documentary manages to make sense of the famous filmmaker's behavior or apparent thinking. But they all have compelling impressions.
FAIR An exhaustive and riveting narrative
BAD Its indictment ultimately feels like a secondary issue to Polanski's apparently incontrovertible guilt, which makes him--in this instance--still more victimizer than victim.
FAIR Seeks to explore both sides of the endless debate and asks all parties to consider every angle before labeling him as a pedophile or misunderstood genius...
GOOD Roman Polanski deserves his badge of dishonor, no question about it. This amazing documentary argues that others need to start sporting one as well.
GOOD a great and somewhat Kafkaesque story that Polanski might have enjoyed directing... had it been fiction.
FAIR Persuasively demonstrates Polanski was guilty as sin, yet his conviction was a miscarriage of justice.
GOOD A subtly intelligent and sharply argued documentary.
FAIR Is Polanski a great filmmaker who made a mistake, or a perverted coward who ran from the law instead of facing the music?
GOOD The Central Park Five," the second best documentary of 2013, examines the case, placing in perfect context of what was happening in 1989 in NYC and how it led to evil both in Central Park and in the offices of the people trying to keep us safe.
GOOD Like the "Paradise Lost" films, it's a shocking but clear-eyed portrait of injustice.
GOOD The Central Park Five is such a moving piece of work, it is difficult to watch at times.
FAIR Expect your blood pressure to rise during The Central Park Five.
GOOD Burns and company conduct a thorough, riveting investigation that does a far better job of assessing the tragedy than the justice system did two decades before. Of course, hindsight is an advantage we all take for granted.
GOOD A heartbreaking expose' about a rush to judgment which ruined five, innocent young lives.
GOOD Exclusive interviews with former heads of Israel's counter terrorism agency reveal insiders' analysis about the country's policies. Fascinating. Frightening.
FAIR How could this second crime have occurred? The film asks that question but only partly answers it, and in the process it raises an even more troubling one.
FAIR "The Central Park Five" is worth seeing, both for the ways it's timeless and for the ways it encapsulates an era.
GOOD What's amazing about listening to them speak now, often through tears, is the absence of bitterness.
GOOD You'll notice something odd as you watch and your anger rises at the injustice of it all: The anger of the wrongly convicted does not.
FAIR What keeps the film from being an impossible downer is the guts and spirit and smart words of the Central Park Five, four of whom, now freed, are interviewed at length.
GOOD At times, this is a devastating film, one that acknowledges the desire for but refuses to buy into an easy answer.
FAIR Among all of the case's horrors, one of the strongest is that a serial rapist ultimately cared more about the truth than the prosecution.
GOOD An unusually good documentary about an outlandish miscarriage of justice.
GOOD Involves a detailed reconstruction of how the story broke, was developed and was dramatized by lurid tabloid headlines.
GOOD A wonderfully vital, illuminating study of the New York of 20-plus years ago.
BAD ... a respectable but often tedious film that adds little to what is already well known about this episode
GOOD A careful, thoughtful documentary that meticulously re-creates what happened on that night and details how and why everything went so terribly off-course.
FAIR A skillfully told and important story, though less factual blow-by-blow and more time spent with the five would have been more compelling.
FAIR Even as "The Central Park Five" seeks satisfactory answers, it stirs outrage and discouragement all over again.
GOOD It's still chilling to see how easily "The Central Park Five" evokes those mad days of urban distrust.
GOOD Fantastic hip-hop documentary has profanity, some drug use.
FAIR It's an insider's celebration of the form, studded with straight-to-camera rhymesmithery from its best practitioners.
GOOD All fascinating stuff if a little repetitive and rambling but definitely one for fans.
FAIR It's hard not to like a film so in love with its subject matter, or boasting such an incredible soundtrack.
GOOD The film is educative, entertaining, in almost all senses a blast. Your body is left in your seat while your soul is blown to the back of the auditorium.
FAIR Preaching to the choir, but that's no bad thing.
FAIR Watchable documentary that showcases some impressive a cappella rap performances and provides the occasional amusing anecdote...
GOOD A very enjoyable and often fascinating movie.
FAIR There's no faulting the lyrical excellence on display. These guys are legends for a reason.
GOOD An extremely interesting insight, proving that rap music is an art form in its own right.
GOOD It's likely to be fascinating if you are a hip hop fan, but almost wilfully unilluminating if you aren't.
FAIR Freestyle, funny but finally just too repetitive, Ice's affectionate home-movie needed someone to structure it into a deeper documentary.
FAIR Hardly definitive (where's Houston and Memphis, and why are MC Lyte and Salt the only females represented?), the movie is nonetheless fascinating for fans, as rappers break down their writing techniques for Ice-T's cameras.
FAIR Essential viewing and a nice companion piece to "Wild Style," "Style Wars" and other key hip-hop documentaries.
FAIR In his debut as a documentarian, Ice T creates a vibrant portrait of how and why rap came to be.
FAIR This is a film that does sweat the technique, with at times illuminating and spirited results.
FAIR The interviews are often revealing and funny. And much of the music is tremendous.
FAIR The faces and voices are endlessly compelling as they talk about what inspires them to lay down beats and recall the early days in New York.
FAIR There's a discipline to moviemaking, too, alas, and when this effort strays from its (admittedly limited) subject to a surfeit of helicopter city shots and Ice's street prowling, it feels padded.
GOOD Extraordinary footage is the highlight of Saving Luna. It is truly mind-boggling to see and hear the Orca, an endearing creature whose playfulness is unexpected and surprisingly moving.
GOOD The real-life story of Luna -- the orphaned male orca that found itself abandoned in 2001 in B.C.'s Nootka Sound and opted for human company over finding its pod -- begs big-budget Hollywood treatment.
GOOD Whether you loved or hated the idea of an orca seeking human company, the story resonated across generational lines and tugged at something deeper, perhaps even primal, in the human psyche. Because directors Parfit and Chisholm explore this psycho-spiritu
BAD The film about an animal that doesn't respect boundaries has set none for itself.
GOOD Director Jennifer Jessum, who also co-produced and co-shot the film with Simon Joseph, adeptly contextualizes White's story within the painful and complex Lakota and Pine Ridge history.
FAIR An efficient talking heads doc that celebrates the band without deigning to hagiography.
GOOD The Eagles live in both the present and the past.
FAIR The film would be valuable for collecting this footage... even if its lapses as documentary cinema and storytelling device were far more serious than they are.
GOOD A beautiful tribute to a rare artist with an even rarer spirit.
FAIR It is the mythic resonance of her story that makes it a worthy subject a documentary. But it is the down-to-earth human touches that make "Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq" worth watching.
FAIR "Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq" presents enough teasing glimpses into the dancer's personal and inner life to demand a fuller picture.
GOOD LeClerq, who lived her later years with a fierce independence, died in 2001; in this thoughtful, quiet film, she lives on.
FAIR As tragedy of the woman whose whole life was the hothouse of the dance -- including narrating her wistful, matter-of-fact letters and journals during treatment -- the doc exploring the myth of Le Clercq will be a balletomane's delight.
GOOD Reminds us what the ballet world had for a time.
BAD Afternoon of a Faun is primarily the story of a woman loved, desired, objectified and watched by men.
GOOD A fascinating story of American ballet and one of the greatest ballerinas in the world.
GOOD Mythic, indeed.
GOOD [A] strangely haunting, often heartbreaking new documentary.
FAIR What's most fascinating about "Afternoon of a Faun" - and what the movie could spend more time delving into - is ballet's grueling and fleeting nature.
GOOD Director Nancy Buirski not only is able to give rare insights into the dance world but a compelling tale of love, friendship and perseverance.
FAIR Buirski takes us on an emotional journey, although the start may seem slow to people unfamiliar with the ballet world or Le Clercq's story.
FAIR [As Le Clercq falls to polio, director Nancy] Buirski digs up footage from the past of people encased in iron lungs or floating in nebulous wonderlands - outside-the-box visual cues that turn the film momentarily phantasmagoric.
GOOD Illuminating, profound and poignant.
FAIR Flawed as it is, no balletomane should miss this one.
GOOD Classical dance great Jacques d'Amboise calls Tanaquil LeClercq's style a "path to heaven." And this lovely documentary by Nancy Buirski makes clear that he's right.
GOOD While it does profile the work of brilliant dancer, the film also contains two complex and moving love stories as well an account of a physically devastating tragedy followed by an extraordinary tale of struggle and survival.
