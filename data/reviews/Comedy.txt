BAD Immaculate execution in every detail of one poor conception after another... uninspired, arrogant, and lazy.
FAIR Cool original camp. This is a fun little movie.
FAIR It's Back to the Beach writ saucy.
BAD It's all enjoyable enough, but it's played so broadly that it loses whatever impact it might have had.
GOOD Sharp satire. Great fun.
FAIR A funny tongue-in-cheek comedy, cinematic commentary and murder mystery all rolled in to one.
FAIR It may be fluff, but it's knowing, relatively enjoyable fluff.
BAD It's too much filmed theater to come alive fully on the screen.
FAIR A promising recipe for comedy that goes flat in the execution.
FAIR Has a great look, but its broad laughs at the expense of '50s and '60s cultural naivete aren't really all that clever.
FAIR An enjoyable, if weightless, romp.
GOOD Not since Rocky Horror has the film world produced such a vibrant farce of teen angst, violence, and sexual deviance.
GOOD Wonderfully campy entertainment that doesn't ask anything of its viewers.
GOOD The sort of movie that even today's superstars might love to slum around in.
FAIR It's best to just relax and enjoy the Party.
GOOD It definitively skewers the false innocence of American pop culture on the eve of the countercultural deluge.
FAIR Offers a wacky portrait of the sexual foibles of men.
GOOD Lukas Moodyson's debut feature has a grainy, immediate feel that nicely enhances the story's emotional honesty -- a quality that our own popular teen movies have only just begun to embrace.
GOOD Nobody can deny the honesty or the outright sincerity this film has.
FAIR Dahlstrom and especially Liljeberg are first-rate.
GOOD Unfortunately, as the plot develops, it shies away from exploring that discontent, in favor of demonstrating precisely the kind of naivete and sweetness that one would expect to find in any teen romance.
GOOD It's just an incredibly insightful character drama about true, awkward, beautiful first love, and it's all the better for it. Oh, and that last shot is as cute as it gets.
FAIR High school, small town, teenagers in hormone hell -- or is that heaven?
GOOD A completely charming reality-based romantic fantasy, both sweet-natured and sympathetic.
FAIR The movie is funny, gentle, and true.
BAD The film has some charm and a winning simplicity but not an iota of depth.
BAD I'm tired of teens talking about make-up and making out. A lesbian twist to an otherwise standard story just isn't enough to make it compelling.
FAIR Successfully captures the frenzied angst and boredom of youth, as well as the powerful, unbridled emotions of first love.
GOOD A poignant exploration of the cruelty and anguish of teenage existence.
GOOD Right away this film grabs attention with documentary-style close- ups and upends teen movie cliches.
GOOD Incredibly fun, incredibly entertaining, and worth watching in all respects.
GOOD A breath of fresh air in a genre too often controlled by Hollywood teen-pap.
GOOD One of the most honest and heartfelt teen dramas ever to grace the screen.
FAIR If McKellar could have just injected some of the eccentricity of his brilliant debut, Last Night, into proceedings we might have had an Ealing-esque social farce. Instead we're left with a comedy that's wry but prosaic.
BAD At best, this aspires to the whimsical charm of Local Hero; at worst, it simply steals from it.
FAIR This is all about duels between rugged veterans. Cheery Gleeson and craggy Gordon Pinset steal the show.
FAIR Though ultimately a somewhat forgettable feature film, The Grand Seduction does have a lot of heart and a certain charm to it which makes for an easy, gratifying experience.
BAD The filmmakers hope for a fable-like charm rather than gritty credibility, but the whole thing feels as cynical as the villagers' convoluted mission.
BAD A comedy drama that offers a portrait of the Emerald Isle that is contrived in its quaintness.
BAD It's a bit of a soppy, sappy film that wastes Gleeson's talent and incidentally appears to imply that bribing oil-company executives is a victimless crime.
BAD Brendan Gleeson and Taylor Kitsch doggy-paddle awkwardly through this lacklustre fishing village comedy.
FAIR Despite some occasional wobbles, this is a charming small-town comedy in the Ealing tradition, while Douglas Koch's attractive cinematography is almost enough to make you consider relocating to Newfoundland. Almost.
BAD Gleeson is a strong anchor and brings some complexity to his part; it's just that he isn't served well by a script that too often mistakes bluntness for irony.
BAD McKellar's take on class is a fib too far: low-grade laughs can't sweeten the sour message that any crap job will placate working folks. Think: Local Zero.
FAIR A snug film about community and the torture of men out of work. There's a warmth to it, a likeability that doesn't wear off. Gleeson's big grizzly bear persona is a big reason why.
GOOD Offers familiar pleasures of no little charm. Sometimes that's enough. When the star is Brendan Gleeson, it may be more than enough.
FAIR Warmhearted and, thanks to Gleeson, laugh-out-loud funny.
BAD As harmless pablum, The Grand Seduction is mildly arousing, just don't expect it to follow through.
FAIR Charming comedy, filled with breezy Irish blarney.
FAIR Thanks to its cast, "The Grand Seduction" turns out to be, if not exactly groundbreaking, at least agreeable, comfortable fun.
GOOD A delightful cinematic gem.
BAD Loved Local Hero? Charmed by Waking Ned Devine? Then go watch Local Hero and Waking Ned Devine.
FAIR Even if it feels a bit formulaic, it's a formula that works.
GOOD So intricately plotted and unlikely that it verges on the exotic, "The Grand Seduction" is nevertheless a hoot.
FAIR A fish-out-of-water fable set within a fabulously scenic backdrop, against which wholesome humor and a thoroughgoing humanist streak play out and intertwine with gentle, unforced ease.
FAIR The more this predictable, faux-endearing Canadian comedy works at being irresistible, the harder it is to enjoy.
BAD The end result is like tea with too much sugar and cream: pleasant enough, but so mild that you start to miss the bitter and the bite.
BAD The attempt at lighthearted sweetness is just like the townspeople's imitation of cricket: They're playing, but they really don't know how.
FAIR An over-familiar formula, but a winning cast
BAD The original, it's ultimately clear, is a much, much more accomplished piece of work.
FAIR It's graceful and sweet and wise where it counts, and often brilliantly acted, and it made me laugh.
BAD The Grand Seduction seems more bent on following the recipe than developing any actual characters or connections.
FAIR Director Don McKellar fills the harbour with some great worn faces, including a lovely turn by Gordon Pinsent as Simon, a town elder whose blue eyes practically twinkle with both drunken complicity and sober reservation.
GOOD The Grand Seduction is a thoroughly modern film that resembles nothing less than classic Hollywood comedies like Local Hero and Waking Ned Devine in both its comedy and its real, rich characters.
FAIR By and large, the film's folksiness bucks schmaltz.
FAIR While it doesn't reinvent the wheel, or the film from which it takes nearly all its ideas, The Grand Seduction emerges as an all too rare specimen: a charming, heartfelt, crowd-pleasing Canadian comedy.
FAIR With just a couple of strong casting choices and a winsome tone, an old formula can still work, and The Grand Seduction comes out of the lab with a disarming readiness to please.
FAIR Gleeson and the collection of good-natured seniors with accents will win your heart.
FAIR Bellocchio famously took on the Catholic Church and the Italian family in his frenetic first film ... Now 40 years later, Bellocchio's attack on the same institutions is calmer and more temperate.
FAIR Enigmatic and mesmerizing.
FAIR An artful look at religious hypocrisy, interfamily dynamics and the way people wrestle with personal history long after the original events are over.
FAIR It's a bit of a mess but strong stuff nevertheless.
FAIR Exceptionally handsome, somber film.
BAD It's almost as if screenwriter/director Marco Bellocchio wants to exorcise personal demons rather than entertain.
FAIR The quizzically abrupt ending leaves [too many] questions, and the viewer, hanging.
FAIR It is a riveting, rich portrait of an atheist who thinks he's resistant to faith but may be in the throes of a feverish conversion.
GOOD Bellocchio's complex drama is held together by the tight and focused performance of Castellitto.
FAIR It's a sly, subtle portrait of systematic hypocrisy (try to count the number of times faith is referred to as an 'insurance policy') and the mysterious way fate binds children to their parents.
FAIR An edgy drama unwinds with an emotional letdown.
GOOD This superbly filmed Italian drama stands with Bellocchio's best work.
GOOD Marco Bellocchio's expansive, memorable film floats and plummets like a box kite in a storm on drafts of melodrama, mysticism and humor.
FAIR My Mother's Smile overflows with mildly interesting ideas and characters, but the end result is decidedly tepid.
FAIR Flawed but fascinating portrait of Vatican politics.
FAIR Bellocchio has a way of spelling everything out for the audience; nonetheless, the film's intellectualism is both provocative and remarkably playful.
GOOD Nick Park is a genius. Enough said.
GOOD A quest for cheese has never been more gutbustingly funny.
BAD Lessons about social responsibility are submerged in a bubble bath of innocent glamour; Amy Heckerling's Clueless looks like a mordant social satire by comparison.
BAD Even Anjelica Huston as a rival cosmetics magnate struggles to inject any venom into the proceedings.
BAD Welcome to adulthood, Hillary and Haylie Duff. Here are your T-Mobile Sidekicks and Tabloid news stories. Leave your personalities at the door.
BAD A brain-numbing, fluffy flick for tweens.
BAD An insipid mess not worthy of the tweens who flock to such flicks.
BAD Along the way, self-discovery bangs 'em over the head.
BAD The Duff sisters are pleasant personalities, but the vapid bimbosity of their characters quickly becomes grating.
BAD Forced to endure such casually offensive nonsense, the viewer ends up slumming it far more than the duff protagonists.
BAD Watchable enough and by no means as bad as The Perfect Man, although there's not much here that'll interest the over-12s.
BAD Messy, patronising and tonally confused, this vanity project - timed to co-incide with Hilary Duff's perfume launch - quite frankly stinks.
BAD "This thing is screwier than Courtney Love!" whimpers Hilary in her usual chihuahua-on-helium whine. Even she, however, manages to shine next to her aggravating older sister, saddled as she is with all the comic timing of a mortally wounded elephant.
BAD Haylie and sister Hilary Duff just don't have the comedy stylings to sell this half-baked story of heiress sisters battling to save their dad's cosmetics empire from ruin.
BAD seems more of an ode to Paris and Nicky Hilton than a decent vehicle for these sisters
BAD Frankly movies like Material Girls sicken me; they're base and soulless and entirely unworthy of the celluloid they were filmed upon.
BAD The villain (a greedy corporate man of some sort) isn't very fleshed out, but it's hard to believe that he's any worse than the two self-serving, appearance-obsessed protagonists, with whom the film asks young girls everywhere to identify.
BAD Martha Coolidge's direction treats the whole adventure with more respect than it deserves, which also makes one wish that she'd been able to work with the Duffs on something much more worthwhile.
BAD As if one Duff wasn't enough for us.
BAD I liked it better with Brittany Murphy.
BAD The fact is, neither Hilary nor Haylie have any flair for subtle comedy.
BAD It's sort of reassuring that although Madge has seemingly given up starring in bad movies, her company is still financing terrible scripts.
BAD The movie, which was not screened for critics, makes a joke of everyone who isn't wealthy, white and pencil thin.
BAD The scariest part of Material Girls comes when you're sitting in the dark theater and start considering the possibility that young women might find these characters sympathetic.
BAD finally drives a Duff vehicle into the land of beguilingly awful.
BAD You might remember it from May when it starred Lindsay Lohan and was called Just My Luck.
BAD This is indeed one dumb film.
BAD Stays true to its name, all right, but there's no reason the film also had to be an embarrassingly unfunny and aimless chore to sit through.
BAD A superficial tween comedy that mocks celebutantes like the Olsen twins while simultaneously pushing stars Hilary and Haylie Duff as their replacements.
BAD Light but listless.
FAIR There is no edge to the movie at all, and that blandness will render it forgettable to anyone over the age of 12 or so, but for all that, it is pleasant enough, and occasionally even fun.
BAD Madonna's anthem was only good-naturedly arrogant, but the SoCal twins, like the film's script, are arrogant, ghastly immature and offensive to any audience that isn't all of the above.
BAD Nonsensical from the get-go, the girls' fish-out-of-water routine grows interminable.
BAD The film opens with the Duffs huffing and puffing their way through a remake of Madonna's 'Material Girl,' an ode to gold digging that Madonna sang with a touch of wry humor; the Duffs perform it as if it was 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'
FAIR Strangely sour and ultimately wearisome.
BAD If you really want to appreciate this film, go see all the hood movies from the 90s - good and bad.
BAD ...the Wayans use a sledgehammer to drive in a thumbtack.
BAD There's maybe three or four half-decent chuckles to be found in this otherwise interminable 90-minute mega-chore.
FAIR The thin plot is merely the frame for gags, and there are more a few good ones here.
FAIR Laugh yourself stupid....Wayans classic!
FAIR A free-for-all comic spoof that brings the 'hood' genre of Hollywood films full circle.
BAD [A] pleasant hour and a half.
GOOD One of the funniest movies of all time
BAD There are zero laughs in this stupid, stupid movie.
BAD The gags -- like most of the Wayanses' humor -- range from astute satire to lowest-common-denominator yucks.
FAIR Rude, crude and outrageous.
BAD If I see one more movie featuring that current favorite of obnoxious movie stereotypes -- the pair of abrasive Asian convenience store owners -- I'm not going to even going to think twice before getting up and leaving the theatre.
FAIR Funny for families of all ages, this animated comedy is a rare and delightful treat.
FAIR The Pirates! Band of Misfits is cinematic booty that shines like gold.
GOOD The Pirates! is the first truly great animated film of the year: a painstakingly-modelled laugh riot that boggles the mind while tickling the funnybone.
FAIR It's got great vocal talent and well-done animation, but it proves once again that the story is the key ingredient.
GOOD A rollicking good time that offers enough broad comedy mixed with more cerebral sight gags to ensure this will be a family favourite for years to come.
FAIR It's full of jokes for adults that will fly right over kids' heads, but retains just enough plot conflict and slapstick to keep younger audiences involved as well.
FAIR The Aardman folks might not have created a pirate film to rival the big screen's best, but they've created a subtle parody of pirate movies that's well worth watching.
GOOD Yes, the film feels childish, but in the best possible way.
FAIR ... enough amusing throwaway gags to keep us entertained.
FAIR The Pirates! Band of Misfits deserves two doubloons up. It shivered me funny bone.
GOOD The fun, infectious tone is set early on and never peters out. The humor is kind of like Monty Python for kids.
FAIR Droll and charming, and will probably appeal more to fans of Monty Python and 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' than to young kids...
GOOD This is a very funny, very good looking movie getting lost in the fray.
FAIR The best laughs come around the fringes, with great throwaway gags and Grant's usual self-deprecating way with dialogue.
BAD A few funny lines and a great vocal turn by Hugh Grant. All else is unexciting. Can't see the kids going wild over this one.
FAIR Deserves no small amount of credit for being an absolute delight... and for never acting like the viewer is an idiot even as it never requires that the viewer be a genius.
GOOD As a running gag, the man-panzee is pretty predictable, but as an observation of how cute creatures are perpetually manipulated and abused in family entertainments, it is rather rich.
GOOD It's hard to emphasize enough just how intricate it is, abundant with rich details... At the same time, it's also warmly human, with characters so expressive you'll want to join the crew.
GOOD The majority of the film can't quite live up to this barnstorming first half hour, but it remains a delight throughout, even when the gags become a little more hit and miss.
FAIR Another winner from Aardman
BAD I wish I could call the plot about a dodo bird 'whimsical,' but there just wasn't enough laughs from these 'Pirates.'
BAD The filmmakers have said they are already dreaming up a sequel. They needn't hurry. Whatever treasures these pirates have are well buried.
FAIR The Pirates! Band of Misfits, succeeds in spite of a faint but persistent sense of factory settings and finishes.
FAIR The Pirates! Band of Misfits fares OK against most modern toon flicks but pales next to other Aardman releases. How a person chooses to rate its success depends on whether one looks at a glass of water and views it as half-full or half-empty.
GOOD a gem of a movie that deserves more praise and audience than it'll probably get
GOOD Delivers all of the laughs, giggles and guffaws land lubbers like us want in a silly film like this.
FAIR There is a lot to like about The Pirates!, especially for those of us who watch a lot of BBC America.
FAIR Young and old alike love a good pirate yarn and the stop-motion specialists at Aardman Animations deliver the goods.
GOOD Pirate adventure blends Victorian history, high-seas fun.
GOOD Pirates haven't generated this many laughs since Johnny Depp's first dip into the Caribbean.
GOOD Even with all the enormous pirate ships, detailed cityscapes and dazzling action, Pirates! is at its best when it focuses on the sillier, calmer moments.
FAIR Chaotic and far-fetched yet funny enough to have audiences rolling in the aisles.
BAD Given the broad drama of the series, their movie should be full of big ideas, and instead settles for redundant gags involving drugs, guns, and high school cliques.
GOOD Remake or no, this movie is hysterical.
GOOD 21 Jump Street gets the remake job done with tongue-in-cheek style & plenty of outrageous moments.
FAIR Because of Bacall's skill at writing great comedic material and Lord's and Miller's talent behind the camera, "21 Jump Street" became more than what it originally appeared to be, which is a surprise I'm always grateful for.
GOOD 21 Jump Street takes the basic concept of the original series, and uses it to create an action/comedy that is not only palatable to modern audiences, but appealing as well.
FAIR Co-written, produced by, and stars Jonah Hill, who took exactly the right attitude towards the movie: He and his costar Channing Tatum embraced the stereotypes, laughed at themselves, and came up with a surprisingly funny film.
FAIR ...feels more like a guerrilla stunt than a soulless and cynical cash grab. Hooray for Hollywood, I guess.
GOOD Slick and funny as hell, 21 Jump Street is one of the best comedies of the year.
GOOD A raucous, entertaining, and incredibly funny film that respects the premise of the original series...
FAIR For an action comedy, "21 Jump Street" had less action or comedy than I expected. It felt as if I spent too much time waiting for something to happen-either for a joke to fire, or a pistol.
GOOD The movie is perfectly pleasant, a smidgen too aware of itself but consistently sharp.
FAIR While the film struggles at the start as Tatum and Hill share little chemistry, they improve minute by minute and are one of the shining lights by the end, their journey boasting a surprising emotional pull.
GOOD t's less fun when the guns come out in the final act, but there's a moment late in the game that redeems the movie's predictable beats, before the whole thing dissolves into entropy and disorder.
FAIR 21 Jump Street is nothing like the original series. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry and the strong beginning and ending do a pretty good job disguising the flabby middle. It's crass, self effacing, 'meta', stupidity and it works.
GOOD Clever, profane and action-packed, '21 Jump Street' fairly leaps onto the big screen as one of the most enjoyable movies of the (still-admittedly young) year.
GOOD The best comedy to be released so far this year.
GOOD I'm as surprised as you that this film could end up being the funniest of 2012.
FAIR Lord and Miller mine the script... for plenty of profane laughs as they set up Hill and Tatum as a hilariously off-kilter comedy duo.
BAD ...it doesn't help, either, that large chunks of the film have been improvised wholesale by the various actors, which only exacerbates the film's excessively slapdash feel.
BAD ... latest in endless slew of painful spoofs based on TV shows takes an OK premise and milks it for an occasional chuckle before devolving into a succession of increasingly lame sketches.
BAD They know it's a joke. But like high school itself, 21 Jump Street hits the wall about halfway in and even prom night can't save it.
GOOD The humor squeezes just about all the giggle juice it can get out of the R rating. If you need a movie map, this 21 Jump Street is on the FAR side of town from Sesame Street.
FAIR by no means a great comedy, but it does demonstrate that playing against the grain can be a good move, especially when the people in charge have run out of ideas
GOOD It doesn't matter if you never saw the original, because this movie is a clever, fast-paced, action comedy...
GOOD A good-natured must-see for fans of broad, silly comedies with a little something under the surface too. Bright, breezy and brilliant.
GOOD It is funny because it is pointed and smart, and it is also funny because it is unusually crass, but the chief takeaway here should be that it is funny.
FAIR Rigorous planning likely was involved in taking the dumb concept of "21 Jump Street" and turning it into something that seems so effortlessly brilliant.
FAIR While hardly raising the bar in action-comedy, it's still a fun, irreverent, laugh-out-loud take on the beloved, small-screen original.
FAIR I won't go so far as to say it's good, but 21 Jump Street is certainly better than it has any right to be.
FAIR The humor may be coarse and crude but it is funny, and with these movies that is what counts.
BAD 21 Jump Street is a cockamamie movie. It's as rowdy as a dick joke. After the 21st dick joke, I wanted to jump off. And after the dick jokes there's a load of excrement jokes.
FAIR It has a tone all its own: drunk enough to lower the inhibitions; not so drunk that it becomes unintelligible.
FAIR Funny and clever but ultimately dispiriting, with a finale that affirms the queasy wink-wink legalized bullying of its early police-vs.-citizens scenes, and that associates manhood with a willingness to kill with a gun -- all for a cheap laugh.
GOOD 21 Jump Street is as fresh and original a comedy you'll ever find that is based on a totally stolen concept. If only all Hollywood rip-offs could be this good.
GOOD Cho's impressions of her mom are legendary among fans, and for good reason.
FAIR When the material is funny, it's extremely funny.
FAIR She can be funny even when she gets on her soapbox.
FAIR Cho's bisexuality supplies her with double ammo when making sex jokes, which are her specialty.
FAIR Cho's fearless in picking apart human foibles, not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience. Her delivery and timing are flawless.
BAD This is hardly big-screen stuff.
FAIR Less structured and, as a result, funnier than Margaret's first!
FAIR Cho is one amusing caustic storyteller. Sharply hilarious and brimming with heart-rendering frankness, Cho exposes herself through the raw observations of the engagingly cheeky comedy concert film Notorious C.H.O....a fearless showcase that's smart
FAIR Has enough laughs to make it worthwhile for Cho's most devoted fans.
FAIR Topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs.
GOOD As hilarious as it is raunchy.
FAIR There's never a dull moment here. Notorious C.H.O. is a Genuine R.I.O.T.
BAD Good for the fans but probably only so-so for everyone else.
FAIR Cho offers some of her best material to date: jokes and stories that will no doubt embarrass and haunt her later in life -- a sign of truly raw, personal comedy.
FAIR The best comedy concert movie I've seen since Cho's previous concert comedy film, I'm the One That I Want, in 2000.
FAIR '...it's better to see her show live in the flash and flesh, but watching Notorious C.H.O. is better than no Cho at all.'
FAIR An hour and a half of joyful solo performance.
FAIR The difference between Cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited.
FAIR Audiences who appreciate extremely raunchy humor will find the giggles flowing, but remember to bring the tissue, because you'll laugh until you cry.
GOOD She's as rude and profane as ever, always hilarious and, most of the time, absolutely right in her stinging social observations.
GOOD [Cho's face is] an amazing slapstick instrument, creating a scrapbook of living mug shots.
BAD Cho's fans are sure to be entertained; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I'm not one of them.
FAIR Where last time jokes flowed out of Cho's life story, which provided an engrossing dramatic through line, here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines.
FAIR Notorious C.H.O. has oodles of vulgar highlights.
FAIR If you really want declare war on the culture of brainless glam, you have to get a bit smart and ugly. In this war, Cho is truly doing her bit.
FAIR Cho's timing is priceless.
FAIR In her first picture, she was as shrill as fingers across a blackboard. Much less shrill and repetitive this time, her act is more inviting to non-fans. Even so, I found it more cute than funny. I never laughed.
FAIR With Notorious C.H.O. Cho proves she has the stuff to stand tall with Pryor, Carlin and Murphy.
FAIR Raunchy though [Cho's] material is, it embraces all comers, regardless of gender, sexuality, race or ethnicity. And it's never been sharper -- or funnier -- than it is here.
BAD A hit- and-miss affair, consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as Cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped.
FAIR Essentially a formulaic showcase for the provocative Korean-American's singular comedic styling.
FAIR While jokes about her mother's indecipherable Asian accent are getting a little tired, the newer material ... demonstrates that Cho still knows what makes audiences tick.
GOOD Brilliant, over-the-edge concert film.
FAIR Begin Again is a delight, not only because of its infectious musical vitality but because it follows the unexpected forks in the road.
FAIR It's not nearly as good as "Once" but still very charming and entertaining.
FAIR John Carney's retread never gets close to replicating the stunning emotional core of Once. But for those seeing Begin Again from a fresh perspective, it's ( ... ) a more light-hearted ( ... ) alternative to the Coen Bros' Inside Llewyn Davis.
FAIR The best thing about 'Begin Again' is what it's not. It's not a love story, or at least not a conventional love story; it's more of a friendship story between a man and a woman, which is something we almost never see in movies.
FAIR I've seen happier endings in Oklahoma! and Singin' in the Rain, but this one feels genuine - and in an unexpected way, deeply satisfying.
FAIR Knightley (supplying her own vocals, more than just competently so, by the way) and Ruffalo have a casual chemistry that works, and Levine is (perhaps unsurprisingly) totally right as a self-absorbed jerk.
GOOD I really enjoyed this. It's such a nice surprise, because so many so-called feel-good romantic comedies these days are pretty ordinary but there's something special about this because there's a level of reality to it in the performances in the situations.
GOOD There's a freshness to this film.
GOOD Bonds born out of art, and specifically music, are nothing new in the movies, but Carney conveys the uniquely exhilarating romance of the creative process behind art like no other filmmaker.
GOOD John Carney is not afraid of a cliche. After all, Begin Again is a musical, a genre that has always thrived on them. And he does know how to shape them to his own design, which is low-key and slightly tongue-in-cheek.
FAIR Thankfully Begin Again doesn't take the predictable routes; it seems to actively reject the easy romantic tropes.
GOOD People who love music, people who love great films, and people who love both, are sure to love 'Begin Again,' an exquisite film by John Carney, who wrought the equally superb 'Once.'
FAIR You'll find a mismatched pair to pull for and a lot of sincerity in this musical romance by the creator of Once.
GOOD In its best moments - which are not infrequent - is appealing mostly on the backs of watching interesting, capable people going on with their business in an engaged, focused manner.
GOOD This is the kind of film that lifts your spirits. If you've had a bad day or are generally feeling down, it will cheer you up. If you're already feeling happy, it will make you even happier.
FAIR ...breezy and consistently watchable...
GOOD a light and dancing comedy about fresh starts
FAIR A mostly pleasant but deeply flawed little film that gets by on its stars and a sense of generosity.
GOOD I found it moving, funny and really rather charming, provoking more than enough laughter and tears to dispel my underlying anxieties about the "live" performances.
FAIR The wholesome, hopeful, let's-put-on-a-show enthusiasm may sound hokey but it's actually infectiously joyful. At the same time, Carney roughs up the edges just enough to make this fairy tale seem somewhat accessible and realistic.
GOOD The result is a film that, while fitting into various great traditions, still bears the unmistakable thumbprint of a singular film-maker.
GOOD Carney's latest isn't quite the equal of Once, but who could have twice bottled that lightning?
FAIR Irish writer-director John Carney is a master at depicting musicians on the cusp of something special.
FAIR This soulful outing is sure to please music lovers. And isn't that everyone?
GOOD Keira Knightley sings and so does the movie!
GOOD A decent feel-good flick that features also decent music. The real reason to see it is the acting especially that of Mark Ruffalo who gives a career best performance.
GOOD A cheery charmer that brings a smile to the face.
GOOD Fans of Once - or, indeed, anyone with a heart - will be swept away by the gentle, sweet-but-sad story.
FAIR Begin Again is a not-entirely-successful movie about not selling out; it's a theme that must concern Carney deeply.
GOOD It's a movie that is painfully sincere and free of guile, with as close to a happy ending as these characters could ever get. If you like musicals, well, here's a good one.
FAIR The gentle lightning of Once doesn't strike twice for Carney, but his latest music movie has charm beneath its slick surface - and Knightley and Ruffalo harmonise just fine.
FAIR Keira Knightley plays Greta, a Norah Jones-like singer-songwriter... It's a typically brave performance from an actress who is always prepared to try anything.
FAIR At times, the scenes are so canned they feel like soap opera. But the movie does have its fair share of decent moments thanks to Ruffalo and co-star Catherine Keener.
BAD It's all a bit easy - though quite nicely performed - and Knightley is never entirely convincing ...
FAIR Can a meaningful glance mean as much as a kiss? In this film, it can, and that's enough.
FAIR No matter how thin the drama, or thick the performances, the film's firefly-in-a-jar, midsummer night's whimsy and heart-on-its-sleeve optimism hath charms ...
FAIR Keira Knightley brings a sweet soul to John Carney's delightful sort-of sequel to his low-fi hit, Once.
FAIR The film is a fairy tale: sentimental but enjoyable if you put a few protective fingers in front of your face to avoid being slurped to death.
BAD John Carney returns with another feature-length music video, turning the surprising charm of his debut, Once, a novel take on the modern musical romance, into a shameless gimmick. Just call it Twice.
FAIR Knightley's bullish Britishness and Ruffalo's bruised charm provide a pleasingly gentle, unsentimental chemistry and, heck, there's even James Corden on a kazoo.
BAD Marijuana legalization is a hot button issue, ripe for boundary-pushing humor. Don't Legalize It oddly pulls back at the very moment when it should be charging forward with all its might.
BAD Given how established their roles are, Don't Legalize It could really use some sort of narrative pull, but it is mostly just content to stand in the middle and watch everyone circle in their fitfully funny ruts.
BAD It gets as stale as pot left too long in the freezer.
FAIR You've got to take your toque off to a dumb movie that is clever enough to try to rook Ottawa politicians into doing the right thing for the wrong reason.
BAD It's tolerable because director Mike Clattenburg, who created the series, overlays the stumblebum ineptitude with a layer of affection.
GOOD ...a crazed road trip to Chuckleville.
GOOD The movie a man named 'Woody' was born to direct!
BAD Really dated, but clever concept.
GOOD This should be a hit-and-miss effort, but it's mostly hits.
FAIR Funny the first time. Multiple viewings offer nothing.
GOOD Its ability to jump around vignette-style allows Allen to generously spread his hilarious schtick to a broad number of subjects without fear of dilution. One of Allen's unsung classics.
GOOD Sperm can be fun!
GOOD John Carradine as the mad scientist! Gene Wilder and the ewe! Tasteless, but funny; the sperm sequence is priceless.
FAIR Too uneven to be good. Too good to ignore
GOOD One of Woody's slightest efforts, to be sure, but it still delivers a healthy batch of laughs.
FAIR Mini skirt girl power continues.
BAD The special effects sequences, silly jokes, tantalizing outfits and overbearing soundtrack seem painfully forced and fake. Or maybe a better word is shallow. This film, for whatever it achieves, is painfully shallow.
BAD Well, at least the title is apt -- this aggravatingly incoherent series of subpar music videos did make me want to see someone fully throttled.
GOOD Once again, the tone is that of a giggly, sweetly knowing, megabucks slumber party.
BAD To paraphrase Steven Soderberg, if having fun on a set was an indication of how good the movie will be then Cannonball Run would be the greatest movie ever made.
BAD This thing is pure garbage.
BAD Stupid stunts that defy rational belief, wasted casting that infuriates and annoys, and more skin than any woman with a brain, agent and reputation should display on screen.
FAIR [A]s with the first film, it's a complete goof, meant to be enjoyed with a large popcorn and lots of air conditioning.
GOOD Full Throtle is full of fun.
BAD If you want to see what $125 million worth of nothing looks like, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is the picture for you.
BAD A lot less fun than 2000's Charlie's Angels, this sequel made for the ADD generation jumps from one thing to the next like a mongoose on crack, and yet comes up with nothing.
GOOD That Full Throttle is an exuberant, eye-catching and infectious film despite a script that probably only exists in theory proves that director McG is a damn McGenius.
BAD Runs out of juice the faster it tries to reach a conclusion. Nice outfits, though.
FAIR Taking hokey acrobatics to an over-the-top extreme, the Angels are as unbelievable as three Xenas on a caffeine high with some of the craziest action sequences ever conceived
FAIR A high spirited ride that just goes on too long.
FAIR A startling/shining example of Hollywood's ability to absorb everything, including anti-Hollywood sentiment, and regurgitate it as something sexier, flashier, more fun, and less filling.
BAD E possivel que nao haja nada para ser compreendido em As Panteras 2 alem do fato de que garotas bonitas nao sao sujeitas a acao das leis da fisica.
BAD Monte d'un cran ou deux les caracteristiques detestables du premier film.
BAD By the time Demi Moore leapt from a building and flew through downtown Los Angeles like Neo, my brain gave up and wearily waved the white flag.
FAIR Perfect brainless Friday night entertainment.
FAIR 'Un delicioso placer culpable que puede ser disfrutado perfectamente por cualquiera que vaya a la sala de cine sin esperar una historia profunda o seria.'
BAD Charlie's Angels was fun. For some reason, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle chooses to be insanely incoherent instead.
GOOD Do not go in here expecting "an action movie" or an "up with people especially girls" kind of flick. This is basically PG-13 porn. And it's a blast.
GOOD Just as much fun as the first one.
BAD The term eye candy has never felt more apropos.
FAIR Director McG has a lot of get-up-and-go, but it's never quite clear where all his go is supposed to be going -- other than to the next set-piece.
FAIR Stylish, lip-stick-slick, these flicks' opening schticks are like a short-wick cracker brick.
FAIR Bigger, louder, and more gratuitous (because 'naked-er' isn't a word).
BAD It's loud, energetic and popping with enough eye candy to induce pancreatic shock in a sperm whale - and the best part? It has absolutely no plot.
BAD It amounts to cinema for goldfish, so empty that even the makers can't remember what happened five seconds ago.
GOOD A textbook example of the perfect crowd-pleaser.
GOOD The biggest impression left by Yojimbo is the characterization of Sanjuro, whose iconography of stoic cool (that inspired Clint Eastwood's antiheroic "Man with No Name") is consistently undercut with dashes of comical realism...[Blu-ray]
GOOD This is one of those movies where it sounds like none of it should work and yet all of it somehow does.
GOOD Even Eastwood's Man With No Name is inspired, perhaps, by the samurai in Yojimbo.
GOOD The explosive outbursts of violence in Yojimbo are superbly choreographed, with Kurosawa's customary use of a telephoto lens creating a hallucinatory feeling.
BAD Despite the sometime appearance of the whole thing as a forthright travesty, it does have stretches of excitement and cinematic power.
GOOD Japan's definitive leading man, Toshiro Mifune, wields wits that are even deadlier than his Katana. Funny, clever, and never a dull moment.
GOOD It is fair to say that, without Yojimbo, certain key aspects of Western cinema would not be the same today.
GOOD Every shot in this film is a textbook study of camera movement and placement, composition in depth, and the use of deep-focus photography.
GOOD There's no denying its snappiness. Whenever you shut your brain off, it hums amicably right along.
GOOD Overall, 'twas a good movie, albeit kind of strange.
GOOD One of Japan's great contributions to cinema, the inspiration for spaghetti Westerns and the introduction of a new kind of film hero.
GOOD Great beginning and ending, but drags a bit in the middle.
GOOD Massive amounts of swordplay and treachery turn it into one of the most entertaining and best Kurosawa films.
BAD Another raunchy race toward the first time; adults only.
BAD I don't know who's out there buying the American Pie video sequels, but I sure do wish they'd stop.
BAD Crude, sure. Vulgar, no doubt. But funny? Not at all.
BAD I never thought I'd believe that the characters in American Pie were rich and nuanced, but compared to the disjointed, half-written affair here, they may as well be from Shakespeare.
BAD Aggressively obnoxious FX comedy with Chase at his absolute hammiest.
BAD Exacerbating matters is [Chevy] Chase's performance, which is incredibly obnoxious even by his standards.
FAIR Great music, mediocre plot and acting.
BAD Although there are plenty of positive, feel-good elements to this movie, they are outweighed by missed opportunities to do something more valuable.
FAIR As a romantic comedy...neither exceptional nor groundbreaking. But as a musical, the movie bursts with foot-stomping, arm-swaying, finger-snapping gospel music.
GOOD The Fighting Temptations is a movie that will soften even the most cynical moviegoer. You can see most of it coming a mile away, and it still works.
FAIR All about the music, and you'd have to be truly tone-deaf not to respond to its soaring harmonies and spirited spirituality.
BAD It feels more like an artificial fable than a story we can sink our teeth into.
FAIR Cuba Gooding Jr. [is] so animated a performer that he even appears to be overacting on this movie's poster.
BAD This film would have been better with a lot more gospel and a lot less Gooding.
BAD Gooding is on a downward spiral, but The Fighting Temptations is at least a step above Snow Dogs and several above the inexcusably offensive Boat Trip.
BAD Fight the temptation to look for anything more than good music in this movie.
BAD The lack of gross-out moments is refreshing, as is the way that it never sacrifices its character-driven plot to a discordant comic set piece.
FAIR Crowd-pleasing but shoddy... During a funeral scene, the corpse can clearly be seen breathing...
BAD Is The Fighting Temptations a washed up comedy or a monotonous musical?
BAD Cuba Gooding Jr. once again (shows) he and comedy do not belong in the same area code (and, come to think of it, after 'Boat Trip,' did anyone need further evidence?).
FAIR I wish the writers had been tempted to write a better story.
BAD The filmmakers seem to have meant to offer up a spiritual message about community and faith, but it's muddled and hard to find with romance, comedy and phenomenal gospel performances all fighting for the spotlight.
FAIR Has practically nothing to recommend it save its music: Take that away and Jonathan Lynn's movie is as ordinary as an unsold TV pilot episode. But what music.
FAIR I've looked forward to Cuba Gooding Jr. movies as eagerly as I anticipate SPAM, but The Fighting Temptations breaks his streak of crumminess.
BAD If you're a gospel lover, you can probably overlook the technical flaws, especially if you see it in a crowded and enthusiastic theater.
FAIR The Fighting Temptations exists for its rousing gospel soundtrack, which is at times so good that you can forgive the movie its flaws.
FAIR The music is glorious.
BAD Can this career be saved? After watching The Fighting Temptations, you may feel that Cuba Gooding Jr.'s may not.
GOOD The most tuneful gospel movie since Say Amen, Somebody.
BAD A woefully thin and pointless musical comedy.
BAD The story is slapdash and most of the jokes are lame, but music by the Reverend Shirley Caesar and the Blind Boys of Alabama lends fleeting touches of a grace that's, um, amazing.
BAD It's not graceful. It's not smart. But it's sweet and cute, and that will do until a real romantic comedy comes along.
BAD A messy, sprawling family barbecue of a movie that barely gets by on salesmanship, energy and maybe more than a little chicanery.
FAIR A hoot and a holler.
FAIR A raucous gospel comedy that's as broad as co-star Beyonce Knowles' vowels and chockablock with foot-stomping, up-with-the-choir music that will have even atheists praising the Lord.
FAIR Its musical sequences could make the most hardened atheist want to go to church.
BAD When anyone opens their mouth to sing, it's good; when anyone opens their mouth to talk, it's bad.
FAIR This movie is an 'everybody's welcome' temple to the synergies of both old and new musics.
FAIR [A] half-forgotten little curio for later generations to study with puzzled delight.
FAIR Car stunts, romance, and salty language in 1970s comedy.
FAIR The movie benefits from some excellent vehicular stuntwork, an apt role for Burt Reynolds, the introduction of Jerry Reed's "East Bound and Down," a bright turn by Reynolds' real-life girlfriend Sally Field, and Jackie Gleason at his hammiest.
GOOD quintessentially 70s and still a ton of fun
BAD The first in the series and the best of a lousy lot.
GOOD A raucous blast with plenty of great lines. Gleason is an absolute riot.
GOOD Gleason is the real show here, but it made Burt a huge star.
FAIR Good, stupid fun, but a precursor to some awful copycats.
GOOD The true mark of a good action flick is that it knows when to play dumb and when not to.
BAD If ever there was a more beautiful yet less funny comedy than Harry and Walter Go to New York, I'd like to see it. Or maybe I wouldn't.
BAD To its credit, The Best Two Years shows a refreshing willingness to acknowledge the foibles and possible problems with some Mormon missionary practices.
FAIR The film is excellent and very informative to non-Mormons. I worked with several in the past and always wondered about this two-year voluntary mission. Its great!
FAIR An earnest and impressively polished attempt at providing an inside look at the experiences of full-time Mormon missionaries.
BAD [Anderson] handles the frat-house humor more convincingly than he does the conversion scenes, which are so serious and emotional that they seem to come from a different movie.
BAD Earnest but bland depiction of Mormon missionaries as normal guys, even if they do live within the drug-, alcohol- and sex-free context of an old TV series.
FAIR The value of The Best Two Years is its wholesome, sometimes humorous view, of missionary life.
FAIR If you see one Mormon movie in your life (and really, to expose yourself to a different point of view, you ought to see one), this is the one to see.
BAD After seeing The Best Two Years, you might want to stop by a construction site to see which is more interesting, this movie or watching paint dry.
FAIR There is enough humanistic truth here, though, to fascinate and entertain non-believers.
FAIR ...the story is a solid one and well worth your time to see.
FAIR Not only does this surprisingly warm and funny -- and well-acted -- comedy-drama stand head and shoulders above the most recent crop of LDS features, it's a film that may appeal to moviegoers outside its obvious target audience.
FAIR The movie proves that Mormon Cinema, even on a small budget, can play in the big leagues.
BAD Like KISS's music, it's juvenile, crass, bombastic, and loud.
BAD A valentine to sex, drugs, and cutting school.
BAD What works for rocking and rolling all night (and partying every day) doesn't necessarily hold true for movies.
GOOD The movie isn't a trailblazer; it's an exuberantly trashy party, a comedy of lowdown defeats and triumphs.
BAD A nice, respective try, but Detroit Rock City just misses the mark.
BAD Look, that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver. Twice. See? Funny!
FAIR Surprisingly amiable for a film that claims to 'kiss the rules goodbye.'
FAIR high energy farce
FAIR Set in the 1970's and produced by Gene Simmons (among others), this scrawny little script eventually becomes a rich film.
FAIR Every bit as cornball as it sounds.
GOOD If you have been with Jesse and Celine through the twists and turns, slips and stumbles of their romantic journey then their long, flowing, deceptively gripping conversations ripple with the realities of life.
GOOD Maybe we'll see more of them in another nine years. But if not, if things end here in this perfect trilogy, then that's enough to consider it as perhaps the greatest cinematic love story of all time.
GOOD The movie's funny at times and difficult at others, and ends absolutely perfectly. The best of the three.
GOOD Delpy and Hawke talk and talk and talk but it is all fascinating.
GOOD Like the Up series, a return to visit old friends
GOOD Making a movie with nothing more than smart dialogue and fine performances is a dying art, but Linklater, Hawke and Delpy remind us that it's a skill worth saving.
GOOD Before Midnight feels like the natural extension of the series, and will be everything fans of it could have hoped for.
FAIR The trouble with those first two film was their souffle-light scenarios...Here, however, things are much juicier as infidelity, commitment, divorce, resentment and all the other soul-sapping things that clock in when you hit your 40s come into play.
GOOD ...in the surprising third act, the film comes together as a plausible horror show of how good intentions and real affection can give way to vicious, realistic psychic combat. (
FAIR ...Before Midnight bears too few similarities to its thoroughly superior predecessors.
GOOD The release of each sequel is becoming an event, so it's particularly great to see Before Midnight not only meeting expectations but raising the bar.
FAIR Before Midnight is no romance. It's a horror movie.
GOOD Takes its traditional romantic tale into more insightful territories.
GOOD Hawk and Delpy know just how to get under your skin. Their onscreen alter egos fit like a glove, and witnessing their ageing, nagging, toying love is a true privilege.
GOOD What lifts Linklater's trilogy above your average dialogue-heavy indie is not just the intelligence of the conversation but its frankness and humor.
GOOD The 'Before' trilogy is a vacation for me. I am taken away, and it is never for long enough. I genuinely feel lucky to have these movies.
GOOD I'm not sure this is the end of Richard Linklater's 'Before' trilogy. It's perfection just as it is, but then again, Linklater has nine more years to work on the sequel.
GOOD Loving words mix with personal attacks, the magic moments with the unintended slights, as we witness the occasional desperation of imperfect people doing the best they can when life moves beyond meet-cute and courtship. That's authentic.
GOOD Linklater and his players bring an end to the fantasy and welcome the thrilling ups and bitter downs of reality to this love story.
GOOD The duo, clearly so comfortable in their characters' skin, indulge in intelligent banter, sharp humour and emotional truths.
GOOD So much better written than contemporary novels, this film is a literary as well as cinematic achievement to cherish. For grown-ups.
GOOD None of the films is faultless in itself, but, tinted with complementary tones, the complete cycle comes as close to perfection as any trilogy in cinema history.
GOOD It's been 18 years since Hawke, Delpy and Linklater introduced us to Jesse and Celine, and their story just gets richer, funnier and more punchy each time we see them. In 1995's Before Sunrise, they were idealistic 23-year-olds.
FAIR Hawke and Delpy are as believably real as any screen couple can ever be.
GOOD This is one of the few sequels for which the cliche 'eagerly awaited' is truly applicable.
GOOD Predictably, it's just as great as the first two.
FAIR By the end, Before Midnight inches towards a dawn of charm. But it's a troubled trip.
GOOD As an organic experiment in collaboration between actors and director, it is a triumph, co-created and co-owned by Delpy, Linklater and Hawke.
GOOD Hawke and Delpy, who are both credited on the script too, have never found co-stars to bounce off more nimbly or bring out richer nuances in their acting.
GOOD The performances and dialogue are wonderfully naturalistic; a reminder that the best special effects are often the cheapest.
GOOD Before Midnight is about the nature of long-term relationships, and the way love deepens and grows but also finds itself subject to the complications of maturity. Smart, insightful, and poignant.
GOOD For those who witnessed Jesse and Celine's tentative getting together as inter railing students almost twenty years ago, it's reassuring to see them still in love.
GOOD Brilliantly directed, superbly written and impeccably acted, this is a thoroughly enjoyable, thought-provoking and emotionally engaging drama that perfectly complements the previous two films.
GOOD It remains as engaging, illuminating, honest and funny as its predecessor; here's hoping we revisit Jesse and Celine in another decade or so.
GOOD It will offend those who are offended by the very title; it will probably thrill those who take one look at the title and immediately want to see the film.
FAIR The results are uneven and occasionally mind-bogglingly bad (which is partly the point), but they're never what you'd call dull.
FAIR And what, pray tell, is the Big JC doing wasting his time helping Canadians?
GOOD The basic premise alone is worth the price of admission for this one.
FAIR the film offers Americans an empathetic glimpse of the country we revolted against all those years ago.
GOOD About more than Bosnia: it's about the immigrant experience; it's about tolerance; it's about making a difference; it's about learning to make the best of what one has.
FAIR People who actually recall 1942 will more greatly appreciate the waves of nostalgia that bathe this affectionate coming-of-age drama, set on a tiny island off New England.
FAIR In the early hijinks phase, the film seems like a dry run for Porky's, but it later gets into the business of fluttering curtains, walks on sandy beaches and longing glances.
GOOD "Summer Of '42" is an unforgettable meditation on sexual awakening and loss during WWII.
FAIR "Summer of '42" is a memory movie, written, directed and acted with such uncommon good humor that I don't think you'll be put off by its sweet soft-focus, at least until you start analyzing it afterwards.
GOOD One of the cinematic coming-of-age stories that started a trend.
FAIR Nostalgic coming-into-manhood fantasy.
FAIR Nostalgia is used as a distancing device -- to keep us safely insulated from the boy's immediate grief, love, and passion.
BAD Dates very badly indeed
FAIR It's apparent in every scene that this is a highly personal film for screenwriter Raucher, and the nostalgia is so palpable that it nearly slides off the screen.
BAD Galifianakis [is] able to turn on a dime; balancing his disarming humour with moments of anguished outbreaks. His is one of the best supporting performances of recent memory; equally funny and heartbreaking. If only I could say the same of the movie.
FAIR For all its problems, though, the film is easy-going, frequently channels into a sweet-natured tone and is able to raise a few chuckles.
BAD It may not be One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but it's also not Patch Adams.
BAD It's also a kind of two-dimensional romance, a kind of flippant look at life on a mental ward, and (...) kind of made me want to give Zach Galifianakis a hug.
FAIR It's Kind of a Funny Story lacks substance, but after you've spent a short time in this ward, you have to agree with Craig: These crazies aren't so bad.
FAIR Wavering between affecting dramedy and goofy asylum- com, this is an enjoyable but superficial placebo that soft-soaps the realities of psychological disorder.
BAD [A] flimsy, box-ticking quirk fest.
BAD As a self-help sitcom, it feels both glib and icky. Glicky?
BAD In the end, like the instantly-forgettable title, it's kind of neither one thing nor the other and certainly no match for the likes of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or even Girl, Interrupted.
BAD No it's not. It's kind of a rubbish story.
BAD As disposable as a paper cup and, for such promising directors, a serious regression.
GOOD It's a fine teen film - and how often do you see those words in the same sentence?
FAIR A pleasant movie, but no more.
BAD It kind of isn't.
GOOD In the end, the title of the film contains an irony that may be lost on the filmmakers: this is kind of a funny story, no more, no less.
BAD Has a genuine understanding of the protagonist, but ends up betraying him.
FAIR It's a neat comedy without being a neat and tidy comedy.
FAIR The journey is aided immeasurably by the casting of Keir Gilchrist as young Craig. He has dark, sensitive eyes and a probity about him that wins you to his side.
GOOD Here is the most uplifting, quirky film I've seen in a long time. It brought me joy.
FAIR Writing and directing partners Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have come up with a smart little film, a gentle drama with both an embraceable tone and a refreshing optimism.
FAIR Even though the film is somewhat mopey, it's also packed with great moments.
FAIR kind of funny, kind of touching, kind of moving, kind of odd, kind of quirky, and kind of lots of other thing, but, it's never fully anything
BAD The people most out of touch with reality are not those onscreen, but the people behind the camera who think this film is a reflection of coping with depression.
FAIR Enjoyable comedy/drama with an engaging script, appealing characters, a superb soundtrack and terrific central performances from Keir Gilchrist and Zach Galifianakis.
BAD The title of 'best movie ever set in a mental hospital' remains firmly secure with 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'
GOOD ...sort of upper-middle class Precious, an emo flick for self-indulgent white kids who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf.
FAIR Low-key adolescent angst, marred by the type of brief fantasy shots and sequences (the characters as rock stars, lip-synching 'Under Pressure') that have become a let's-go-for-an-easy-laugh crutch for filmmakers.
FAIR Zach G.is the next Bill Murray.
FAIR It's a less anguished, much funnier 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'...
FAIR ...able to honestly juggle mental illness and a sense of hope.
GOOD A rich and unusual film that really defies categorization.
FAIR The writing-directing team of Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden have created a solid mix of serious, darker scenes and flights of fancy.
FAIR The acting is strong, with Galifianakis doing an especially good job as the likeable Bobby.
FAIR Is that the best approach to take about a subject as heady as mental illness, especially at a time when there are more kids on Zoloft than Flintstones? chewables?
BAD Where?s Nurse Ratched when you really need her?
FAIR Call it "Cuckoo Light" with a PG 13-appropriate amount of angst and just enough laughs and creativity to keep your attention.
FAIR It?s no "One Flew Over the Cuckoo?s Nest," but this little dramedy about life in a Brooklyn psych ward has its small charms.
FAIR Sunshine Cleaning a compelling and thoroughly adult picture, boasting an original plot and, in Adams and Blunt, two of the most talented young actresses working today.
GOOD Amy Adams and Emily Blunt, two fine actresses, get the opportunity to glow in strong lead roles as complex, emotionally fractured females who work hard to earn your respect -- and reclaim their own.
FAIR Sunshine Cleaning is a decent film, especially if you already like this sort of thing, with a lot of subtlety and a desire to represent actual human beings without demonizing or beatifying any of them.
FAIR Well worth a look for those who aren't too disillusioned with the post-Juno Indie film scene.
FAIR Amy Adams sweeps through the wide-ranging role with zest, enthusiasm and just the right touch of simmering self-anger.
GOOD More sobering than laugh-out-loud funny, Sunshine Cleaning gives full weight to the impact of death without rubbing our faces in the crime scenes.
FAIR Megan Holley's script feels like it's been Sundance-workshopped to death. However, the cast - led by Amy Adams, Emily Blunt and Alan Arkin - establishes a vibrantly odd family bond that sustains "Sunshine Cleaning" through its dimmer portions.
GOOD Driven by top-tier performances from Adams and Blunt, Sunshine Cleaning is a charming dramedy that lifts the dirt on life and death.
BAD Not entirely insubstantial, even as the bulk evaporates from the mind.
FAIR The sort of movie you root for, hoping it'll break through to be something special. It never quite does, but it still has the not-insignificant value of two fine actresses cast as sisters. [Blu-ray]
GOOD While it may sound like Little Miss Sunshine's poor relative, or Sundance by-the-numbers, this is an enjoyable, poignant, moving and - yes - funny film in its own right.
FAIR Everything Amy Adams touches turns to gold, and even here where she is playing a character thoroughly down on her luck, she is luminous.
FAIR Jeffs makes a good fist of the direction and Blunt proves that she can do comedy, but it's Adams's comforting, charismatic central turn which really gives the film its lift.
FAIR Ultimately, the film is too neat, and too cloyingly sweet to tackle anything resembling real life.
BAD Instead of something fresh and funny, this film is as formulaic and empty as any Hollywood blockbuster.
GOOD Jeffs shows economy in her direction and steers through the potentially difficult script with skilful handling of tone and mood, wonderfully striking balance between laughs and tears. What a relief it is to unearth this quietly sparkling gem.
FAIR Sunshine Cleaning gets an A for Amy Adams. Injecting some heartfelt, three-dimensional zest into the wispy, two-dimensional story, she spares this copycat indie's blushes and scores a winning combo with Blunt.
FAIR The film has poor commercial prospects, as its plot is too slender, its tone too blandly upbeat.
FAIR It's a film so achingly average it almost deserves an award for mediocrity.
FAIR It's not on a par with Little Miss: there's some whimsical-tragical stuff about talking to the dead via CB radio, and the producers might want to think beyond using "Sunshine" in a title again. But I would have been sorry to miss this.
GOOD Sunshine Cleaning is a winning combination of heartbreak and quirky humour.
GOOD Sunshine Cleaning will be the sleeper of this year, a movie soon to be talked about in the same breath as Sideways, Juno and Little Miss Sunshine.
FAIR Sunshine Cleaning is not perverse for the sake of it: its eccentricities arise from characters whose lives fall outside the life guide manuals.
FAIR Could have been a little more darkly comic in places but the performances are superb.
GOOD It's worthwhile just for Adams and Blunt, a partnership made in movie heaven.
BAD Best to take a page from Rose's metier and bleach this one fully out of sight and mind.
FAIR Occasionally it struggles to walk the line between black comedy and bleak dysfunction. Ultimately, though, this is a fresh and refreshing outing with a surprising amount of heart.
FAIR Amy Adams [is] terrific in Sunshine Cleaning but the material lets her down. It's as if it's trying to push every indie film button in the book.
BAD Although the film isn't brilliant, the script has its moments and includes some memorable dialogue: "How'd she die?" "It was a do-it-yourself kinda thing."
GOOD So many things worked so well that you might not expect would %u2013 from the cheery fakery of an awkward high school reunion to the complexities of this line of work.
GOOD It's still relatively early in the year, but this is definitely one of my favorite films so far in 2009.
FAIR It's all a bit over-baked at some moments; other moments shine with the emotional truth that one hopes to find if one must be subjected to a montage of nasty crime scenes.
GOOD They're ordinary people doing the best that they can. And that's what makes 'Sunshine Cleaning' so enjoyable for adult audiences.
FAIR Sunshine Cleaning is a movie that transcends the obstacles of its genre to sporadically soar to welcome heights. It is characterized by strong direction, skillful editing, and an ensemble cast that will be among the best of the year.
BAD Nine-year-old kids may sit through it and have fun, but nine-year-olds would also eat french fries 23 hours a day if their parents didn't force them to try something more nutritious.
BAD The result is 80 brief minutes of movie skits assembled in an order that sort of resembles a plot.
BAD The movie will be of interest only to Nielsen's most devoted fans and to those who wonder why Nicollette Sheridan never made more movies, or more swimsuit calendars.
BAD The jokes come in sporadic volleys rather than the steady machine-gun pace of The Naked Gun and Airplane!, and, with a few exceptions, they are less truly aimed.
BAD The blockbuster action thriller genre is ripe for sending up, but this lazy effort has to go down as a miss despite the presence of spoofmeister Leslie Nielsen.
BAD Sporadically funny, but never more than a sting of crude gags.
BAD Yet another Leslie Nielson movie parody, targeted this time at James Bond pictures and their many spinoffs.
BAD As funny as Nielsen can be, like all comic actors he still needs the quick-thinking jokes and zingy one-liners to be genuinely funny.
BAD Spy Hard just comes off as a long commercial. And yes, that means most of the best moments you've seen in the movie's trailer.
BAD Nielsen's schtick is getting pretty threadbare by now -- his movies used to wring laughs from assaults on his silver-haired dignity, but after years of screen buffoonery, he has no dignity left to assault.
BAD A classic example of why David Zucker/Jim Abrahams/Jerry Zucker-style comedies should be left to ZAZ themselves.
BAD Stay for Weird Al Yankovic's brilliant opening credits, then flee!
BAD Nielsen, with his expert deadpan and sense of comic timing, creates the illusion of humor -- for about 15 minutes.
BAD [Scores] only a handful of genuine laughs during its scant 78 minutes.
BAD Most of the humor falls flatter than Steve Forbes' flat tax pitch.
BAD A dreadfully unfunny comedy that takes Naked Gun-like sketches and rehashes them without a whit of style or energy.
BAD Never consistently humorous.
BAD Filled to the bursting point with witless, sub-Mad magazine movie parodies, pointless cameos by a seemingly endless parade of has-beens, and once-hysterical, now stale jokes lifted straight from Airplane! and the original Naked Gun...
BAD You know you're in trouble when the highlight of a movie comes during its opening credits.
BAD You won't laugh hard at Spy Hard. And that's not because the jokes aren't funny. Most of them aren't even jokes.
BAD Ugh.
FAIR A rollicking paean to the musical that owes as much to Hollywood as it does to Bollywood.
GOOD Wristcutters: A Love Story is like a suicidal Wizard of Oz.
BAD It is a staggeringly awful road movie, not much enlivened by the presence of Tom Waits as a wizened participant.
FAIR The purgatorial premise is pleasingly eccentric but, in the end, Wristcutters falls victim to its washed-out mood, and limps bloodlessly to a close.
BAD A dreary, self-consciously quirky indie flick that seems to go on forever, despite an economical running time.
BAD Veering from witty to occasionally trite, Wristcutters: A Love Story has plenty of originality on its side, but never manages to be more than the sum of its self-consciously quirky parts.
FAIR A little self-consciously kooky but with an ace soundtrack that combines gypsy punksters Gogol Bordello with real-life plug-pullers this sure beats putting your head in the oven.
FAIR Dark subject matter, but Goran Dukic's film is whimsical and determinedly optimistic about life.
FAIR For the better part of the journey this a bizarrely uplifting yarn - razor sharp, you might say.
BAD Opportunities to comment on the ethical grey areas of suicide are mostly squandered and, as the pointless digressions begin to pile up, your mind begins to drift from the action on screen.
GOOD Enjoyably quirky black comedy that's clearly destined to become a cult movie amongst the Gothic contingent.
FAIR Despite being occasionally hilarious, director Goran Dukic should have toned down the wackiness.
BAD Another indie director more interested in style than substance.
BAD If you're going to make a comedy about suicide, you'd better make sure the jokes land. There are people out there who could use a laugh.
FAIR It has 'midnight movie' written all over it.
FAIR Wristcutters is a small film of ambitions nicely scaled to the performances and story. Who knew that affectless characters could be so oddly affecting?
FAIR Wristcutters opens with what proves to be its best scene, one that could stand alone as a brilliant short subject.
GOOD The vision of life after death varies between the religious and the non-religious, the optimists and the pessimists and the believers and non-believers. There are few after-life stories, though, as unique and humorous as this.
FAIR All this sounds rather grim, and indeed it is -- but this backward Heaven Can Wait is also, thanks to [director] Dukic's inventive imagination, surprisingly involving and ultimately sweet.
FAIR Wristcutters is a cut above most low-budget American indies, with something original to say about the human condition and an artful way of saying it.
BAD Goran Dukic's film starts off seeming hip and funky and dark, but almost immediately runs out of steam. It feels like a short carelessly padded to feature length.
BAD The future of Wristcutters as a cult favorite is less assured. Rather than benefiting from repeated viewings, the movie's charm is pretty much spent after the first half hour.
FAIR We witness the birth of a new genre, the Post-Slasher Movie.
FAIR Croatian filmmaker Goran Dukic's debut feature turns out to be a sweetly grim lark: a road film through Limbo.
FAIR ...more whimsical and charming than you would ever expect from a picture about suicide.
FAIR Though it goes a bit wonky toward the end and seems to travel a very long way to drive home a rather simple point, Wristcutters: A Love Story remains a wonderfully evocative experience.
BAD Almost 40 years ago Easy Rider established that road trips can make great independent films. Or at least cheap ones. But when booking a room inside the pearly gates, cheap may not be exactly what you're looking for.
BAD Screenwriter/director Goran Dukic can't quite decide on a tone. The film is at times lighthearted, almost effervescent, and then it's so dark that it becomes depressingly bleak.
FAIR Wristcutters is quite a bit darker than most mainstream romantic comedies. As you might not expect, it's also quite a bit more inventive and far wittier than most mainstream romantic comedies.
GOOD Goran Dukic, working from a short story by Etgar Kiret, has fashioned a life-after-death that is both somber and silly.
BAD The witless Wristcutters holds all the fascination of a train wreck. Youa(TM)ll stay in your seat just to see if ita(TM)ll get any worse, and you wona(TM)t be disappointed.
FAIR Mostly animated PG film has gross-out humor, violence.
BAD I enjoyed it. It's a fun, dumb and gross comedy that kids will love.
FAIR You'll probably find yourself laughing at Bill Murray farting. I did.
FAIR It is funny, original, and even contains a genuine, good-natured theme.
BAD ...the whole thing eventually becomes bogged down in its own plot.
BAD The ideas are there, hints of genius, but no one ignites them.
GOOD I'd advise attendees of this film to go on an empty stomach, but if you're willing to endure the Farrellys' warped sense of humor and Murray's scratching, squirting, gas-passing antics, Osmosis Jones offers some lighthearted fun.
GOOD The over-riding question with all comedies is 'Are there many laughs in it?' Luckily, the answer is yes - there are lots of great jokes, and not all of the scatological kind.
FAIR The design of this colorful interior metropolis is both clever and biologically correct.
GOOD Deserves all the praise showered upon the overrated Shrek.
FAIR Leave it to the Farrelly brothers to once again gross us out.
FAIR The script has just enough clever jokes to keep us chuckling, even if it never scales the heights of classic comedy.
BAD ...it's up to the animation to keep us entertained, and those sections turn out to be much too predictable.
FAIR This is the kind of premise you'd expect to be filmed as a five-minute educational video, if at all. But this feature is 95 minutes and never drags.
FAIR While it's certainly not among the best movies of the year, Osmosis Jones is not a film that deserved to end up $60 million dollars in the hole.
BAD If there wasn't any live action and the animation bit had been fleshed out more then this could've been a highlight of the season...
FAIR An enjoyable, if vastly underachieving, diversion.
BAD ...se disfruta en su parte animada, y mucho mas si se tiene o se recupera cierto espiritu infantil en la edad en la que los pedos, mocos, etc. podian sacar sonrisas .
FAIR So what went wrong? In a nutshell, the live action portion.
GOOD Osmosis Jones is one of the most daring and original major Hollywood movies in a long time.
BAD Osmosis is missing a spark.
GOOD Folks who go to it expecting the traditional Farrelly flood of bodily fluids won't be disappointed, but it's likely they'll laugh harder at the witty dialogue and references to other films.
FAIR For the most part, it works because of its own visual inventiveness and the complete lack of pride on the part of both Murray and Elliott.
BAD It should have been placed in a hazardous waste container, encased in concrete and dumped into the Farrelly brothers' septic tank.
BAD Because the film teeters between adult humor and being family oriented -- Osmosis Jones fails to connect with either audience.
FAIR never quite takes off the way you're hoping it will
BAD ...ideally suited for the video market.
BAD Despite a barrage of puns that will whiz over the heads of the average eight-year-old ('virus con dios,' 'Funny, he doesn't look fluish,' and the like), this film wasn't intended for the enjoyment of adults.
BAD Isn't a movie so much as a health-class nutrition lecture.
BAD It's no funnier than your average grade-school biology lesson and less pedagogically useful than your typical Farrelly brothers comedy.
BAD If someone like Levy can't escape the vicious circle of these lousy flicks, what hope do we have?
BAD ...completely and utterly devoid of anything even resembling competence...
FAIR Funny and intelligent, despite some flaws.
GOOD Garofalo is accessible to anyone in the audience (except maybe herself).
GOOD Rom-com charmer with a smart script and Garofalo in top form.
GOOD Janeane Garofalo's magnetic yet unconventional presence instantly pulls the audience into the story.
FAIR Better than it looks ... but not by much.
GOOD Since when is Garofalo less appealing than Thurman?
GOOD A spry and perceptive romantic comedy highlighted by the spirited performance of Garofalo's self-deprecating guise
FAIR This sly update on Cyrano de Bergerac owes a lot to Janeane Garofalo, who inexplicably disowned it.
FAIR Sometimes sad, sometimes uplifting. This is a heady meditation on the trials of modern romance.
FAIR Though its romantic-comedy triangle borrows heavily from Cyrano de Bergerac, the film has more in common with Three's Company.
GOOD The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, featuring his heroic man-and-dog duo, Wallace and Gromit, is Park at his sublimely silly best.
GOOD Park and co have shaped a wonderfully warm and fuzzy family adventure out of old horror clichA (C)s.
GOOD Instead of vainly pursuing today's latest trends, only to see them turn into tomorrow's embarrassments, Park and co. fall back on the values of the past, preferring substance and craft to the fleetingly voguish.
GOOD It's a one-joke premise, but part of Nick Park's madness/genius is the skill and detail with which he approaches it.
FAIR With Were-Rabbit, Mr. Park establishes Gromit as the best animated canine character since Snoopy.
GOOD Full of the British wit and kinetic action-movie thrills that have made Nick Park's cartoons so popular.
FAIR ...cute and pleasant (yet essentially forgettable)...
FAIR click to read review [Greek]
BAD It's a surprising misstep from the people who gave us Chicken Run.
GOOD The comedy is never indulged at the expense of the plot, which flies off in genuinely unexpected directions, culminating in a boundlessly inventive funfair chase sequence.
GOOD I don't see how anyone who enjoys their animated movies won't enjoy all of this one.
GOOD Gromit...could teach ninety percent of the actors working today something. He can say more in a glance than most actors can using their entire range of tools.
GOOD Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is an inventive pseudo-thriller in the Claymation style.
GOOD An unqualified success.
GOOD This might be Plasticine's finest hour.
GOOD Taken as a whole, this is a superb film and an astonishing technical achievement.
FAIR The script this time is really better than the animation and the result is genuinely funny. This is an animated film, but it aims to please the whole family and its aim is good.
GOOD [Not] merely one of the best animated films of the year; it's the best, and further, ranks among 2005's most satisfying cinematic experiences.
GOOD A delight for the kids and well set to take classic status.
GOOD Cheeky and inventive, it's the perfect Halloween movie for the kids! Or as they say, it's the world's first vegetarian horror movie.
GOOD It doesn't feel produced; it feels made.
GOOD It deserves to be the biggest thing in animated features since Shrek and quite possibly Toy Story.
FAIR The first two acts of the movie are actually solid, filled with vintage W&G moments as well as some stunning animation.
GOOD It's a ripping good yarn, to boot, breathlessly paced and seamlessly edited, but most important, resoundingly and surpassingly fun.
GOOD Park and Box make this 85 minute film feel like a half hour with its quick moving plot line, making it perfect for children.
GOOD It is suitable for any child who can follow a complicated story -- although there are some scary bits -- and it is equally appealing to the child hiding in any adult.
GOOD There is something indescribably satisfying about the vaguely off-kilter world of Wallace and Gromit and its litany of details.
FAIR There's none of the Hollywood cynicism or too-clever winks meant to instill a sense of exclusive superiority, just a sincere celebration of what makes good filmmaking and a desire to entertain.
GOOD It is funny, exciting, and it's a fantastic piece of animation.
FAIR Go for the beginning and the end and try to endure the middle.
GOOD A polarizing, but classic piece of children's entertainment filled with whimsy, horror, comedy and imagination.
GOOD This is Gene Wilder's legacy. He was perfect for the role, and it was his mixture of childlike wonder and bitter, deserved vengeance that made the character so compelling.
GOOD Pure, sweet imagination for both kids and adults.
BAD The passages in the mysterious factory, which should be Charlie's and our release from the oppression of the earlier scenes, are just as ugly as everything that's come before, so there's no contrast.
GOOD ...filled with good humor, good acting, and good songs...and it's just off kilter enough to keep everyone's attention.
GOOD Ainda que um ou outro numero musical comprometa o ritmo, o clima de fantasia e a atuacao calorosa de Wilder conquistam o espectador.
GOOD The movie bursts with creativity, deep thought and comedy.
GOOD Probably Gene Wilder's finest, most manic hour.
GOOD Weird and wonderful
GOOD Just a frolicking Wonka visionary schnozberry flavored delight!
FAIR It has a huge following, though I've never understood why.
FAIR If "creepy" can be an asset, then this is the best kind of creepy you'll ever find.
GOOD A timeless family film that will continue to endure as long as people love chocolate.
GOOD The original feel good film from 1971, is back in a special new DVD edition for its thirtieth anniversary with some great special features.
GOOD Brings joy to adult and child alike.
FAIR The zany factory's imaginative gimmicks, and that vivid color scheme, will keep even the youngest kids alert.
GOOD Cynical and raunchy comedy for adults only.
BAD Unfortunately, the tender observations Zwigoff and Clowes specialize in are largely missing from Art School Confidential, which spends its energy on the zany people who'd usually pepper the edges of their films.
BAD It's too crass to be a plausible satire, and not funny enough to be a dumb comedy.
GOOD It's the work of two misanthropes in an even worse mood than usual.
GOOD An ingenious satire of the pretentious mindset of the elitist art world from the perspective of a rapidly-disillusioned kid who had no idea what he was getting into.
FAIR ...generally comes off as nothing less than a substantial disappointment.
BAD The few characters we might have cared for become increasingly shallow, and it all lapses into cliches about the relationship between art and infamy, between personal integrity and selling your soul, and so on.
BAD The true merit of the movie is the momentary pleasures of the dialogue and the performances, but the story itself leaves you wanting. So, is it art? Looks like it.
BAD Has the makings of a mediocre, after-school sitcom
FAIR Art School Confidential s'avere une autre belle reussite pour les deux artistes [Zwigoff et Clowes] qui, esperons-le, collaboreront a nouveau dans un avenir rapproche.
FAIR This smarty-pants campus yarn is on fire with satire.
FAIR Director Terry Zwigoff and comic book artist-turned-screenwriter Daniel Clowes follow up their Ghost World success with a less satisfying collaboration.
FAIR Ita(TM)s fine that this film feels uncomfortable indulging the shopworn tropes of coming-of-age story or black comedy or romance or mystery thriller, but, well, ambivalence is self-propagating.
BAD Rather than observing the intimate details that make an Art School project special, the filmmakers opt to focus on Art School partying (i.e., drinking and vomiting) instead.
FAIR Well-meaning, but ultimately flawed.
BAD This has the feel of a beginner's film and has some fun moments and a good performance by John Malkovich, but overall does not have enough to keep it going.
GOOD Zygoff and Clowes do get the most out of their first-rate cast and prove that hollow laughs are far superior to no laughs at all.
BAD In almost any medium, Art School Confidential would draw a failing grade.
FAIR It's a sardonic, subversive, heavy-handed black comedy, painting a nasty picture.
GOOD Bitter, flawed, a bit sophomoric, but compelling in a way that better balanced cinematic efforts rarely are.
FAIR ...a sort of John Hughes revamp of Fritz Lang's 'Scarlet Street' (another film in which sexual desire leads a struggling painter down a path of death and stolen artistic identity).
FAIR ...if the lack of chemistry between the leads and the glued-together nature of the plot bring the movie down, they don't totally extinguish its subversive spirit.
BAD "Art School Confidential," compared to Zwigoff's other masterpieces "Ghost World" and "Crumb," is a paint-by-numbers picture.
BAD If you're an art student, you'll probably buy the movie on DVD and rub it all over your body.
GOOD Their humor comes not from a need to be loved or a need to win awards, but rather straight from an acute awareness of the world's follies.
FAIR No matter which is the real imitator, life or art, Art School Confidential does its own fine job skewering both.
BAD The film loses its way with multiple subplots, becoming a hodgepodge that isn't particularly hard to follow, but, far worse, provides no compelling reason to bother.
BAD The movie has no supportive theme or rhythm, nothing to bind its dotty patches together.
BAD This tale of a naive young student who is thrown to the arrogant wolves at an art school comes off as both insecure and insincere. I often didn't believe it, and I wasn't sure the creators really believed it either.
BAD A movie with the odd, tired joke about art and artists, a college romance that isn't romantic, and a plot twist that doesn't twist at all.
BAD It feels deflated, disgruntled and pathetic.
FAIR It is so gloriously unconvincing, so utterly absurd, that it achieves a kind of greatness.
BAD A sure candidate for the worst movie ever made...
FAIR ...unabashed fantasy...
BAD Even with a tiny budget, The Worst Year of My Life has ambition, but limp acting, unoriginal story beats and lifeless characterization mires its scope.
FAIR OK slapstick in the "Home Alone" vein
BAD Hey, at least the baby wasn't talking.
FAIR Tot-sized laughs
BAD For the seven people out there who hoped for a movie stupider than "Home Alone 2."
FAIR Not nearly as awful as it could have been...it at least knows that it's cheesy, which makes it more fun.
BAD It's not really clear why this movie was necessary %u2013 it does not reinvent the 50's movie so much as do a highly faithful cover version of it. (Gus Van Sandy's shot-for-shot remake of Psycho is a similar pointless academic exercise.)
FAIR ...gently wacky. Although breezy and sketchy on the easy laughs at times, Alien Trespass does promise to entertain for the sole purpose of its campy off-kilter makeup.
FAIR If the film succeeds perfectly in its aim, to recreate exactly a genre of films noted for how shoddy and boring they were, is it then fair to complain when the film is itself boring?
BAD Alien Trespass won't let our knowledge of the stereotypes it incorporates do the work and make the critique.
FAIR If you're willing to check your brain at the door and to suspend a lot of your disbelief, Alien Trespass manages to be a delightfully zany and campy satire best experienced at midnight with a group of friends.
FAIR A true love letter to genre days gone by, Alien Trespass delivers on its promise to bring back a slice of the good old days to horror cinema.
FAIR While it never rises to the level of Galaxy Quest, my gold standard for funny sci-fi films, Alien Trespass consistently delights and amuses.
BAD Retro-style sci-fi action spoof tries hard but doesn't work.
FAIR A highly entertaining retro Sci-fi blast from the past that is loads of fun, an endearing tribute to all those bad movies we just loved.
BAD ... once those warm, fuzzy feelings of nostalgia start to wear off, all you are left with is a tedious movie that is full of wooden performances, campy dialogue, cheesy and outdated special effects, eerie music and space beings in rubber suits.
BAD This lazy effort gets points only for truly loving -- perhaps to a fault -- the cheapo creature flicks of the 1950s.
BAD Alien Trespass, with a rating notice that mentions 'brief historical smoking,' is at least better than last year's official remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still.
BAD It's a satire without laughs, a parody without punch lines, a careful copy that replicates everything except the original's life.
FAIR How much you enjoy this strange picture depends on two things: Your appreciation of the genre that is being feted here, and the enthusiasm of the audience that you view it with.
FAIR Alien Trespass is an intriguing experiment, and I admire its craftsmanship.
BAD If you're not going to have fun with such a silly cinematic subgenre, what's the point in resurrecting it? Or, from the more pertinent audience point of view, in seeing it?
BAD A charmingly sentimental but ultimately pointless homage to the sci-fi classics of yesteryear.
BAD Fun at first, the movie quickly wears thin. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but if that's your choice, you better be sure the thing you're imitating is worthy of it.
BAD While Alien Trespass stays true to the era and the genre, it forgets that its mission in this galaxy is not merely to pay tribute but to entertain.
BAD Alien Trespass, which opens Friday on the heels of the witty Monsters vs. Aliens, feels like an also-ran.
BAD Bewildered? You won't be alone.
BAD Alien Trespass, an affectionate tribute to flying saucer movies, treats the cliches of drive-in sci-fi with touching naivete. So why isn't it more fun?
BAD To see how Alien Trespass might have been done, rent The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra with its puppet monster on visible strings, its dime-store sets and its dreadful artificial dialogue.
FAIR Alien Trespass could be the latest bulletin from Mystery Science Theatre 3000 except that we're the silhouetted heads and the filmmakers are sitting right there next to us.
FAIR At a certain point you find yourself thinking, why not watch the real It Came From Outer Space, instead of this mildly amusing replica?
BAD A pale imitation of a drive-in movie, with nothing silly or sloppy enough to qualify as camp.
GOOD The football scenes are brutally real; the locker room scenes are totally authentic.
GOOD Pro football fans may be disillusioned by this excellent, honest, and often brutal expose of the play-for-pay game.
FAIR The leading man, Nick Nolte, has a physical authority and a clowning, irreverent manner that lend the film some semblance of continuity, even when it's about to flounder.
FAIR Raucous football tale with effective Nolte.
FAIR It's still fascinating to get a glimpse of what athletes sacrifice to entertain us. It would have been considerably more fascinating if more of the people involved had seemed more human.
FAIR For a sports flick, this is unique and holds your attention for the most part.
FAIR Too bad it is difficult to really care about what is going on since such a thoroughly unpleasant character is at the center.
BAD A slightly unpleasant and shocking film.
GOOD Woody Allen nao e so um cineasta de extrema cultura e de um timing comico irrepreensivel. Ele e, antes de tudo, um dos mais talentosos roteiristas que o Cinema ja produziu.
GOOD La historia es maravillosa.
BAD Witnessing Elisabeth Shue kissing Woody Allen full on the mouth in excruciating close-up is about as hard to watch as the wood-chipping scene in Fargo.
BAD The dialogue lacks snap, and Allen-the-actor's comic timing seems a beat off.
FAIR The lightweight story eventually runs out of gas and stops, but it provides little to take away other than some fleeting humor.
BAD "Million Dollar Arm" is bland and overlong at 124 minutes. Simply put, there is nothing here of interest.
FAIR Based on a true story, this is one of those relentlessly uplifting Disney movies that mixes comedy and emotion to inspire and move the audience.
BAD Craig Gillespie's by-numbers schmaltzathon never transcends its tourist's-eye views of India or patronisingly cliched views of its people.
FAIR In its own gently comical way, Million Dollar Arm plays up the misunderstandings between Hollywood and India -- as well as the mutual fascination.
FAIR A likeable and agreeable movie.
GOOD Though it doesn't offer much by way of freshness, Million Dollar Arm is about as enjoyable as a predictable film gets, thanks to a feel good mix of genuine heart and wit.
GOOD It might sound like a superhero movie but Million Dollar Arm is a stirringly human drama based on a true story and a welcome reminder that extraordinary feats can be achieved by mere mortals.
BAD A cold, hard business story, reshaped by Disney into a warm, fuzzy hug.
FAIR There's nothing wildly unpredictable on offer here, but it still winningly manages to sneak its way past your defences.
GOOD The steady hand of director Craig Gillespie (whose previous work includes the off-kilter Lars and the Real Girl) is evident throughout, and the result is warm, witty and thoroughly entertaining.
BAD Hamm's charm works well playing a debonair scoundrel on television but in this bland, family friendly offering, it's a resource that's quickly drained.
GOOD Very funny underdog comedy that's genuinely heartwarming and full of charm.
FAIR A cross between Bend It Like Beckham and Cool Runnings, you can see what Disney is pitching from a mile away, but it's polished and pleasant.
BAD Hamm and Bell keep this hooey light, but you can't lob a ball in here without hitting notes played better in Jerry Maguire and Slumdog Millionaire.
FAIR As far as sports movies go, like Hamm, it's immensely likeable.
GOOD "Million Dollar Arm" benefits from a strong performance by Jon Hamm in the lead and a top-notch supporting cast.
BAD Its true story actually smells rather fishy in that almost everything about it plays as manufactured schmaltz.
BAD ...it ultimately seems obvious that this material is inherently not able to sustain a feature-length endeavor.
GOOD A Grand Slam
FAIR Achieves a certain emotional authenticity even as the viewer anticipates exactly which heart string will be plucked and how.
FAIR Million Dollar Arm scores a triple.
BAD Million Dollar Arm could be subtitled The Best Exotic Marigold Pitching Mound.
FAIR It doesn't have a mean bone in its overly long body of a script. The touch of Disney, a family-friendly PG rating and a baseball story add up to a crowd-pleaser in 'Million Dollar Arm.'
BAD Sappy, saccharine, and predictable to the point where it's almost painful.
GOOD An uplifting and inspirational tale
BAD Million Dollar Arm, you had me at Jerry Maguire.
FAIR It may not be the most memorable film out there, but Million Dollar Arm is a fine film that the whole family can enjoy.
BAD All the potential edges have been sanded off. And so, a quite remarkable true story, no matter how truthfully told, feels like a formulaic fable.
FAIR For a heart-warming movie that praises risk taking and out of the box thinking, Million Dollar Arm plays its narrative surprisingly safe.
FAIR Luckily, a terrific cast that includes Alan Arkin, Suraj Sharma, Bill Paxton, Pitobash Tripathy and Madhur Mittal holds this unwieldy thing together. (Bill Paxton, Jon Hamm or Lake Bell in the cast of any film is generally a good sign.)
FAIR Based on true events, this is a heartwarming, uplifting, feel-good family film - in the popular Disney underdog sports genre.
FAIR A charming cast makes it succeed, but a lack of willingness to really push boundaries never lets it become anything more.
BAD The best thing that can be said about Million Dollar Arm is that it wears its emotions honestly. But as a fan of baseball, I have to say that matchups are always more interesting when you go into that first inning unaware of who's going to win the game.
FAIR Feel-good sports dramedy is a fine pick for tweens.
GOOD JB is not the wisest of men and Million Dollar Arm makes no bones about him being a character in need of an upward arc. Even so, the movie never sacrifices the other characters as mere handmaidens to his growth.
FAIR Million Dollar Arm is like taking a tour bus ride with a competent guide: You know exactly where it's going, but you like the company.
BAD Slackers meet Satan in not-quite-so-excellent adventure.
BAD Mostly disappointing results.
GOOD Has there ever been a more perfect role for Keanu Reeves than floppy-haired, dim-brained high school slacker Ted "Theodore" Logan?
BAD ...the various elements that made Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure such an unexpected delight are almost entirely absent here.
GOOD awash in weird humor and outlandish gags
FAIR A riot of visual invention and weird humor that works on its chosen sub-moronic level, and on several others as well...
FAIR strained but goofy fun
FAIR Its best moments make up for its more mediocre ones.
GOOD More mindless airhead time-traveling fun. The hilarious William Sadler gives the best portrayal of Death since Bengt Ekerot in THE SEVENTH SEAL.
GOOD EXCELLENT! (But not quite as EXCELLENT! as the first.)
FAIR Worth seeing if only for the scene in which Bill & Ted play 'Battleship' with Death.
FAIR Diverting nonsense
FAIR Doesn't eclipse the original, but the dorky charm is still there ... plus it's got William Sadler's immortal turn as Death.
GOOD One of the most worthwhile sequels of recent years, maybe funnier than the original as it intelligently expands the potential for the surreal and it ties up all the loose ends managing, quite remarkably, to give pointlessness a purpose.
FAIR Silly, sophomoric and very weird. Or, in Bill and Ted's vocabulary, it's lame, scorched and egregious.
BAD So ridiculously dumb that it's difficult to be a good sport about it.
BAD Fans won't be disappointed and people who didn't like the previous film wouldn't like this one either.
GOOD Screwball comedy for older teens and adults.
GOOD This is the Coens dabbling in the mainstream, and bending it to their will.
GOOD The Coensa(TM) first mainstream romantic comedy is a superb hijacking of an ailing art form -- short, sharp and frequently laugh-out-loud hilarious.
BAD Destined to rank among the Coens' least memorable achievements.
GOOD A great movie.
FAIR A fun romp, thanks largely to the deft work of its two leads.
FAIR Despite the inconsistent script and low tone, this has many funny moments. If you can forget the negative view it takes of mankind, ita(TM)s entertaining because of the performances of Clooney, Zeta Jones, and the rest of the cast.
GOOD The Coens ... have taken a typically trite target for ridicule and splayed it out for an attack from outer space, where Coen brothers scripts tend to originate.
FAIR Half the pleasure of Intolerable Cruelty is watching the Coens play it safe
GOOD A date-movie with brain cells.
FAIR Viewers won't feel like they've been dealt with too cruelly.
BAD The operative word in this film is 'restrained.'
BAD It has some good gags, but then so did The Wedding Singer.
BAD ...it does live up to its title by being both cruel and intolerable, although not necessarily in the redeeming ways one might hope for.
FAIR Clooney, in one of his best screen turns to date, exhibits the right degree of screwball aptitude.
BAD Unlike Steve Martin's portraits of LA, "Intolerable Cruelty" doesn't find the loneliness beneath the sheen.
GOOD Darkly funny and oh-so-wicked, "Intolerable Cruelty" is quirky diversion that will appeal to fans of other Coen brothers films.
GOOD Watching Clooney and Zeta-Jones interact is suitably fun, and neither of them is exactly hard on the eyes.
BAD A pretty much paint by numbers job, but Clooney and the divine Ms. Jones have great chemistry and timing and successfully manage to wrestle the script to the ground.
FAIR A frequently hilarious screwball comedy about the battle between the sexes, which here all boils down to one thing: money.
FAIR While it's not nearly as beguiling as the Coen's last pic, the uncanny The Man Who Wasn't There, Cruelty is still a brisk hoot.
FAIR It will delight their fans with its random humor and its palate of bizarre characters.
BAD ...the movie eventually takes a dark turn that it's never quite able to recover from.
FAIR Both Clooney and Zeta-Jones are given simple lines that they deliver so deliciously that they set some sort of gold standard.
GOOD The joy of Intolerable Cruelty is in watching Clooney deconstruct his suave screen persona, that mix of Cary Grant cool and Dean Martin hip, in front of your very eyes.
FAIR Worth seeing, and more fun than the average Hollywood rom-com.
FAIR Clooney and Zeta-Jones have a level of antagonistic banter recalling the best of the Hepburn-Tracy chemistry. Now, this is what is meant by the term movie star.
BAD ...a decidedly underwhelming entry within Kubrick's increasingly spotty body of work...
GOOD By a whopping margin, this is Kubrick's most radical film and greatest dramatic gamble.
GOOD The blackest black comedy ever made by a major Hollywood studio, and one of the funniest handful of films made in English.
GOOD Because of its uncanny insight and frighteningly prescient satirical edge, Dr. Strangelove is a document of its time and also timeless. It held onto its relevancy by being bitter, cynical, and thinking absolutely the worst of people.
GOOD Dr Strangelove is one of Stanley Kubrick's many masterpieces, one of the greatest films about the Cold War and one of the greatest comedies ever made.
GOOD Black comedy Kubrick classic for smart teens+.
GOOD It's easily one of the director's best films of his somewhat controversial career.
GOOD Dr. Strangelove's status as the movie that confirmed both Stanley Kubrick's reputation and the arrival of beat-sick irreverence can no longer be retracted.
GOOD Kubrick nos presenteia com uma perola de humor negro que critica acidamente as guerras e a mediocridade dos homens por tras destas.
GOOD It's as startling today as it was then. Catch it now before it becomes too relevant to be funny again.
GOOD Sound funny? It is.
GOOD Endures as one of the finest political satires.
GOOD It still features Peter Sellers' finest three performances as well as proving that the supposedly humourless Kubrick was up for a laugh.
GOOD This landmark movie's madcap humor and terrifying suspense remain undiminished by time.
GOOD Stanley Kubrick's 40-year-old satirical polital-comedy about the end of the world is especially disturbing as one ponders world events at present.
GOOD The paradigm of all end-of-the-world political thrillers and a part of the American vernacular.
GOOD Is Dr. Strangelove Kubrick's best movie? Along with Paths of Glory, absolutely.
GOOD Kubrick's great 1964 tragicomedy about superpowers on the nuclear brink continues to fascinate new generations of moviegoers, as its frequent reissues attest.
GOOD A masterpiece of satire, paranoia and straight comedy. One of the all-time classics with a great cast and many memorable moments. Sellers is magnificent.
GOOD If there never were another satire of war, you'd think this one would have single-handedly stopped the whole mad business.
GOOD Frightening, hilarious -- and indelible.
GOOD Masterful and highly original
FAIR ...still shocking in its giggly nihilism.
GOOD Masterpiece
GOOD Easily classifiable as one of the top ten films of all time.
GOOD Hysterically funny cold war satire. Peter Sellers' triple role is the crowning touch. One of Kubrick's greatest films.
GOOD The shameful, criminal wrongs depicted in this document from the past are with us today.
GOOD An absolutely hilarious and brilliant satire in which Kubrick's assured and precise direction serves, for once, to make an incredibly entertaing film as well as a smart one.
GOOD The final word on the Cold War... the defining text on a subject so overwhelmingly horrible that all you can do is laugh.
GOOD Stanley Kubrick's best film. A perfect satire.
GOOD One of the greatest films ever made.
GOOD A Duck Soup for the Cold War era.
GOOD The film is always saying something, and a viewer would have to be deaf and blind not to recognize the targets of the sarcasm.
GOOD Dr. Strangelove (1964) is filled with great comic performances.
BAD A competent but self-righteous film that offers little insight into love or faith.
BAD If religious films aren't your bailiwick, stay away. Otherwise, this could be a passable date film.
BAD The film is old-fashioned, occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface.
FAIR Beers, who, when she's given the right lines, can charm the paint off the wall ... [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures.
BAD Imagine the CleanFlicks version of 'Love Story,' with Ali MacGraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes.
BAD The romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be.
BAD A shockingly crass grab for holiday pocket money that's both infantile and endlessly patronising.
BAD A re-hash of tired cliches and CGI effects.
BAD That the lead character is a 'male cow' complete with udders shows how confused the picture is.
FAIR A beatifully animated simple but fun plot, carries enough giggles for all age groups.
BAD The animation is perfectly colorful and the voice actors earn their paychecks, but it's blatantly obvious that this thing started production without a screenplay -- and hit the screens without a plot.
BAD Deserves to be hanging in the nearest meat locker.
BAD This could be the film that snaps everyone's patience with Hollywood animations which have a Dell computer chip where their heart should be.
BAD There are far better ways of keeping the kids happy.
FAIR Good voice talent and some funny moments.
BAD It's impossible to shake the impression that Barnyard was written by idiots. Why else would the male cows have udders?
BAD The design is uninteresting, the characters are bland and the story is terrible.
BAD Strictly for kids, and, as the three or four people who saw Oedekerk's previous directing effort, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist, can attest, the writer/director tends to stretch even throwaway jokes minutes past the punch line.
FAIR Ben the Cow (the voice of Sam Elliott) has to teach his carefree son Otis (Kevin James) the responsibility of leadership over the farm animals. This is far from Otis' mind, but inevitable. Barnyard is a farm version of The Lion King with eno
FAIR There is a nice mix of humour and pathos here. Barnyard may not be all that exceptional, but it is quite satisfying.
BAD Not good enough for even a rental, this 'Barnyard' should be burned for fear of mad cow disease
BAD Barnyard doesn't know if it wants to be another tiresomely 'hip' piece of post-Shrek postmodernism or a comfortably traditional kids' movie that delivers family values without the self-conscious smirk.
BAD Could cause more gender confusion than 'Transamerica.'
FAIR All the cows have udders - even the male ones. In real life, only female cows have udders. What kind of sick, alternate cow universe does this movie take place in anyway?
BAD Barnyard is a one-note premise that falls flat after about 10 minutes.
BAD "Barnyard" doesn't stink. But it's not the cream of the crop, either.
BAD The funniest joke is the one nobody talks about: the gender confusion of male cows with udders.
BAD Barnyard isn't a complete waste of time, it's just too familiar.
BAD A Lion King clone that's tailored to the Fisher-Price crowd.
BAD With shamefully obvious nods to the father/son sentimentality of traditional Disney 'toons and even an awkward love interest, Barnyard is a mishmash of modern cartoon cliches.
BAD With 'Barnyard,' the androgynous udders, as annoying as they can be, are about the only original thing to be found in the whole movie.
BAD never really amazing enough to separate it from the rest of the herd of great animation that we've seen this summer.
BAD [W]hy do the male cows have udders?.. This isn't supposed to be the animated version of TransAmerica.
BAD doesn't just violate the audience's right to entertainment, it violates animal dignity to such an extent that PETA might want to consider getting involved
BAD The CG animation looks like rubbery plastic instead of animals, and much of it is spent on jokes related to derrieres and hindquarters.
BAD Lesbian Cows!!! Lesbian COWS!!!! Carnivorous LESBIAN COWS!!!! Aarg!
BAD There's barely enough of a story to sustain a short film, much less a feature.
BAD Forget the confusion of the he-cows that populate the film; the real problem is that Barnyard is just a lousy, lousy movie.
BAD Udderly ordinary.
BAD Nearly every joke lays an egg.
BAD your kid won't learn anything from Barnyard, but they might need 10 years of therapy after viewing the movie's fight scenes and COYOTES ATTACKING THE FARM.
BAD Laughter comes from the movie's absurdity, not its comedy.
BAD Other than confusing children, it's hard to know what the inane, tedious, mean-spirited Barnyard is trying to do.
FAIR Two delightful stars nudge Wild Target into sleeper territory - but only by a few inches.
FAIR ...mindless entertainment in a refined style.
BAD Wild Target is the sort of madcap comedy that breaks a sweat trying to generate a steady stream of laughs, but ... the film only works in fits and starts.
FAIR "Wild Target" has fast, quippy dialogue and exactly the right actors to drive it home.
BAD When the various elements all fizzle, all we're left with is some likable actors trying their best to save a fading film.
FAIR Snappy, sarcastic, implausible caper that looses almost all momentum 1 hour in. Also, how do you feel about Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt making out? If you just threw up in your mouth a little, you might wanna avoid this.
FAIR Saucy, scattershot, screwball farce.
FAIR The film has to fly by its wits -- and its witty lines -- and by the charm of its stars. This it does, just barely.
BAD It's never a good idea to cast Bill Nighy as a buttoned-down hit man.
BAD Screenwriter Lucinda Coxon has clearly never met a corny complication she didn't like, and Wild Target becomes riddled with irksomely madcap happenings by the final act.
BAD Rarely in a British comedy have so many richly talented actors laboured so long in search of a coherent plot, plausible characters and even a modicum of humour.
FAIR If not better than the French original, this re-make is equally good and equally funny.
BAD The film is directed with a surprising lack of comic spark by Jonathan Lynn.
BAD With an interesting premise and a capable cast, it's a shame the result is such a dead horse.
BAD A mostly admirable attempt at a Crichton-like escapade that runs out of steam a bit before half-way.
FAIR Wild Target gets its gears gunked up by a detour into the shallow, polluted waters of pseudo-psychological melodrama.
FAIR There have been a lot of black comedies about assassins lately -- there have been a few just this year -- but Wild Target may be the first one to contain genuine laughs.
FAIR An eccentric little comic thriller filled with enough laughs that I was mostly willing to overlook the fact that it makes virtually no sense as a thriller.
BAD All of this busyness drains away the film's charm, turning what might have been a naughty and whimsical frolic into something glib, hectic and sour.
BAD Since irony is so often director Jonathan Lynn's weapon of choice, Wild Target should have been a good fit. It's not quite.
BAD desperately unfunny
GOOD The movie's a grand, quick-witted entertainment, a throwback in the best, most welcome sense.
BAD Director Jonathan Lynn already made one assassin comedy ... Consider this the lazy encore no one asked for.
BAD Wild Target neatly and boringly makes a surrogate family out of its ill-matched trio of caricatures, and its epilogue of domesticity is enough to make you reach for your revolver.
BAD Nothing works.
BAD It's entertainment designed to resemble a good time without aspiring to provide one.
FAIR The likable and talented cast give it their all, but it's never as zany or funny as it should have been.
BAD Wild Target is a remake of a French farce, and it shows.
BAD Nighy and Blunt do bring a lot of warmth and charm to their roles, but thanks to a badly judged script and lazy direction, the final showdown leaves you feeling cold.
FAIR When Wild Target works it's a lot of fun. There's some decent comic chemistry between the three leads - and this is Grint's first film since Harry Potter 3 that didn't make me want to lob him out the window.
BAD This lively British remake of the 1993 French film is an enjoyable if ultimately too-silly romp. But the solid cast at least makes it watchable, even when the plot takes a series of deeply contrived turns.
BAD There's a wretched tiredness and dull reliance on formula and, hard as the cast may try, a powerful whiff of desperation not helped by the ikky prospect of Bill and Emily getting jiggy.
BAD The action hits a dead end and the laughs dry up, but it's the budding romance between the young free spirit and the crotchety old triggerman that really kills it.
FAIR A bizarre mixture of streetwise raunch and starry-eyed ingenuousness.
FAIR There's nothing sweet about this very strange character, Jerri, but you still can't wait to see what outrageous thing she'll do next.
FAIR In spite of its demented flavor, the movie surprisingly doesn't push the envelope the way the series did.
FAIR Amy Sedaris suits up as everyone's favorite former-prostitute/drug addict-turned-high school student in the long-awaited--and quite funny--big-screen version of the cult TV series.
FAIR Clever and undeniably peculiar, Strangers with Candy suffers from both a complete lack of focus and a terminal case of self-satisfaction.
FAIR Connoisseurs of the show likely relish the induced awkwardness and off-kilter rhythms of the piece; a good part of its appeal was the blank and baffled looks it induced in the uninitiated.
FAIR Walks a fine line of comedic self-awareness, and only on occasion loses us in a haze of condescending wit.
FAIR This plays like a 'Season One' DVD, silly moments interspersed with lots of dull plot and lame high-school send-up situations.
GOOD Like the classic comedies of Chaplin, Hawks and Woody Allen, Strangers With Candy is more than just a good subjective comedy -- it's a great objective film.
FAIR The key to its success -- at least whatever success it can muster -- is the manic work of Amy Sedaris.
FAIR Fans of the show will rejoice and a few newbies will become converts.
FAIR I laughed my gluteus maximus off while watching.
BAD Stretched to feature length, it's not consistently funny, but there are inspired moments and whipsmart lines that suggest how good the show was.
FAIR Audiences should find the film brilliant or repellent. At the most interesting moments, it's a bit of both.
FAIR The film is probably destined to be a cult success at best, since the TV program was an acquired taste and could be a little much, even when limited to 30 minutes.
FAIR The highlight is Sedaris, unflinching as she throws herself into Jerri's clueless optimism.
BAD A half-hour sketch with an hour of padding.
BAD It's a one-joke film that thinks its joke is funnier than it is and runs it into the ground, but not before getting a few laughs.
BAD Jerri up close, with her geek grin and potty mouth, is testing.
FAIR That the filmmakers struggle dragging the idea out to feature length is hardly surprising.
FAIR We get Colbert, and we get Sedaris as Jerri Blank for just a little while longer. That's enough for us.
FAIR Some things were meant to be seen in small doses or on small screens. For all its subversive perks and quirks, Strangers is one of them.
FAIR If Steve Martin was right, and "comedy is not pretty," then Amy Sedaris' Jerri Blank must be the funniest character on the planet.
BAD The series' unflagging cynicism was a dead end that now seems callow and perhaps even insincere, considering the political engagement displayed by co-creator Stephen Colbert in his new persona as a faux conservative news commentator.
FAIR The school is like none you've seen on screen before. Mary Katherine Gallagher would 'love, love, LOVE!' it, as do I.
FAIR Thanks to the comic genius of Sedaris, Strangers With Candy is a good thing -- as long as your taste buds can handle the politically incorrect aftertaste.
FAIR Sure, you may cringe, or shudder, or even wonder when your tastes became quite this puerile, but Strangers With Candy is a long-awaited treasure of ludicrousness with very few dead spots.
FAIR Flaws and all, Strangers with Candy has one invaluable thing going for it: the utterly fearless and downright brilliant comic performance of Amy Sedaris.
BAD Maybe a half-hour dose was just right, because the film's pacing is torpid and many of the jokes fall flat.
BAD It's so brilliant in places that it can make a viewer root for it, but that's not exactly the same as enjoying it, not really.
FAIR This is just about the one-billionth movie to lampoon the horror genre, but so what? It's hilarious.
BAD Given the talent involved, it's a project that sounds promising (if maybe more than slightly derivative), but it winds up an unfortunate misfire.
BAD The jaw drops at the drought of laughs in the horror spoof "Hell Baby," especially considering the massive amount of comic talent in front of and behind the cameras.
BAD I can't say I didn't laugh during Hell Baby. I just didn't laugh as much as I would have liked to, or as much as I expected to.
BAD Certainly isn't the worst horror comedy of all time (see Transylmania)... But most of it is still pretty bad.
BAD It soon becomes apparent that the filmmakers, many of whom worked together on "The State" and "Reno 911!", aren't committed to their film's main conceit.
BAD [It] rarely dares to be smart, settling instead for familiar gags that would have the Devil himself yawning.
BAD A film that's less than half as funny as its predecessor, and a sliver as clever as the original.
BAD This offensive, crass pastiche makes "Grown Ups 2" look like a paragon of wit and good taste.
BAD Garant and Lennon's attempts at humor are absolutely terrible. It's as though they have no idea what comedy is or how it works. This results in a series of gags that they must think are hilarious, but are actually extremely sad and cringe-worthy.
FAIR In the end, the level of delirium is addictive. Getting there, however, is a challenge which may or may not be worth your time.
BAD There are genre satires, and then there are dumb comedies that wish they could qualify for that status.
FAIR Its modest (if occasionally gross-out) stabs at genre parody rarely insult our intelligence and even allow for the kind of retro deadpan silliness Mel Brooks used to underline his louder punch lines.
BAD Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon's Hell Baby is a hit-or-miss affair with far more misses than hits.
BAD When you consider that Garant and Lennon make their living as screenwriters for hire, Hell Baby's shoddy script is an unholy mystery.
FAIR The filmmakers satirize the often obscenely meaningless ways in which people of a certain socioeconomic strata attempt to launder their white guilt.
FAIR Hell Baby is a devilish laugh-riot, providing hellishly indulgent comedy married with lighthearted slapstick comedy - as long as you're into Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant's typical "immature" style.
FAIR It's genuinely funny, a condition all too rare in horror-comedies, comedies, and movies written by Lennon and Garant.
BAD Marlon Wayans' A Haunted House no longer can own the title of the worst horror spoof of 2013.
BAD For every joke that works- about ten fall flat.
FAIR It doesn't reinvent the wheel after their anarchic sketch comedy show "The State," but funny is funny, and Hell Baby is very, very funny.
BAD A sempre presente narracao em off e um dos muitos problemas do filme - especialmente se considerarmos que o narrador e justamente um escritor mediocre.
