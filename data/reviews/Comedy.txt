0.4 <|###|> Immaculate execution in every detail of one poor conception after another... uninspired, arrogant, and lazy.
0.6 <|###|> Cool original camp. This is a fun little movie.
0.6 <|###|> It's Back to the Beach writ saucy.
0.5 <|###|> It's all enjoyable enough, but it's played so broadly that it loses whatever impact it might have had.
0.8 <|###|> Sharp satire. Great fun.
0.65 <|###|> A funny tongue-in-cheek comedy, cinematic commentary and murder mystery all rolled in to one.
0.6 <|###|> It may be fluff, but it's knowing, relatively enjoyable fluff.
0.3 <|###|> It's too much filmed theater to come alive fully on the screen.
0.7 <|###|> A promising recipe for comedy that goes flat in the execution.
0.6 <|###|> Has a great look, but its broad laughs at the expense of '50s and '60s cultural naivete aren't really all that clever.
0.6 <|###|> An enjoyable, if weightless, romp.
0.9 <|###|> Not since Rocky Horror has the film world produced such a vibrant farce of teen angst, violence, and sexual deviance.
0.8 <|###|> Wonderfully campy entertainment that doesn't ask anything of its viewers.
0.8 <|###|> The sort of movie that even today's superstars might love to slum around in.
0.625 <|###|> It's best to just relax and enjoy the Party.
0.8 <|###|> It definitively skewers the false innocence of American pop culture on the eve of the countercultural deluge.
0.6 <|###|> Offers a wacky portrait of the sexual foibles of men.
0.875 <|###|> Lukas Moodyson's debut feature has a grainy, immediate feel that nicely enhances the story's emotional honesty -- a quality that our own popular teen movies have only just begun to embrace.
0.8 <|###|> Nobody can deny the honesty or the outright sincerity this film has.
0.75 <|###|> Dahlstrom and especially Liljeberg are first-rate.
0.875 <|###|> Unfortunately, as the plot develops, it shies away from exploring that discontent, in favor of demonstrating precisely the kind of naivete and sweetness that one would expect to find in any teen romance.
0.875 <|###|> It's just an incredibly insightful character drama about true, awkward, beautiful first love, and it's all the better for it. Oh, and that last shot is as cute as it gets.
0.75 <|###|> High school, small town, teenagers in hormone hell -- or is that heaven?
0.9 <|###|> A completely charming reality-based romantic fantasy, both sweet-natured and sympathetic.
0.75 <|###|> The movie is funny, gentle, and true.
0.5 <|###|> The film has some charm and a winning simplicity but not an iota of depth.
0.5 <|###|> I'm tired of teens talking about make-up and making out. A lesbian twist to an otherwise standard story just isn't enough to make it compelling.
0.75 <|###|> Successfully captures the frenzied angst and boredom of youth, as well as the powerful, unbridled emotions of first love.
0.8 <|###|> A poignant exploration of the cruelty and anguish of teenage existence.
1.0 <|###|> Right away this film grabs attention with documentary-style close- ups and upends teen movie cliches.
0.8 <|###|> Incredibly fun, incredibly entertaining, and worth watching in all respects.
0.8 <|###|> A breath of fresh air in a genre too often controlled by Hollywood teen-pap.
0.875 <|###|> One of the most honest and heartfelt teen dramas ever to grace the screen.
0.6 <|###|> If McKellar could have just injected some of the eccentricity of his brilliant debut, Last Night, into proceedings we might have had an Ealing-esque social farce. Instead we're left with a comedy that's wry but prosaic.
0.4 <|###|> At best, this aspires to the whimsical charm of Local Hero; at worst, it simply steals from it.
0.6 <|###|> This is all about duels between rugged veterans. Cheery Gleeson and craggy Gordon Pinset steal the show.
0.6 <|###|> Though ultimately a somewhat forgettable feature film, The Grand Seduction does have a lot of heart and a certain charm to it which makes for an easy, gratifying experience.
0.4 <|###|> The filmmakers hope for a fable-like charm rather than gritty credibility, but the whole thing feels as cynical as the villagers' convoluted mission.
0.4 <|###|> A comedy drama that offers a portrait of the Emerald Isle that is contrived in its quaintness.
0.4 <|###|> It's a bit of a soppy, sappy film that wastes Gleeson's talent and incidentally appears to imply that bribing oil-company executives is a victimless crime.
0.4 <|###|> Brendan Gleeson and Taylor Kitsch doggy-paddle awkwardly through this lacklustre fishing village comedy.
0.6 <|###|> Despite some occasional wobbles, this is a charming small-town comedy in the Ealing tradition, while Douglas Koch's attractive cinematography is almost enough to make you consider relocating to Newfoundland. Almost.
0.4 <|###|> Gleeson is a strong anchor and brings some complexity to his part; it's just that he isn't served well by a script that too often mistakes bluntness for irony.
0.4 <|###|> McKellar's take on class is a fib too far: low-grade laughs can't sweeten the sour message that any crap job will placate working folks. Think: Local Zero.
0.7 <|###|> A snug film about community and the torture of men out of work. There's a warmth to it, a likeability that doesn't wear off. Gleeson's big grizzly bear persona is a big reason why.
0.8 <|###|> Offers familiar pleasures of no little charm. Sometimes that's enough. When the star is Brendan Gleeson, it may be more than enough.
0.75 <|###|> Warmhearted and, thanks to Gleeson, laugh-out-loud funny.
0.4 <|###|> As harmless pablum, The Grand Seduction is mildly arousing, just don't expect it to follow through.
0.6 <|###|> Charming comedy, filled with breezy Irish blarney.
0.7 <|###|> Thanks to its cast, "The Grand Seduction" turns out to be, if not exactly groundbreaking, at least agreeable, comfortable fun.
1.0 <|###|> A delightful cinematic gem.
0.5 <|###|> Loved Local Hero? Charmed by Waking Ned Devine? Then go watch Local Hero and Waking Ned Devine.
0.6 <|###|> Even if it feels a bit formulaic, it's a formula that works.
0.875 <|###|> So intricately plotted and unlikely that it verges on the exotic, "The Grand Seduction" is nevertheless a hoot.
0.625 <|###|> A fish-out-of-water fable set within a fabulously scenic backdrop, against which wholesome humor and a thoroughgoing humanist streak play out and intertwine with gentle, unforced ease.
0.625 <|###|> The more this predictable, faux-endearing Canadian comedy works at being irresistible, the harder it is to enjoy.
0.2 <|###|> The end result is like tea with too much sugar and cream: pleasant enough, but so mild that you start to miss the bitter and the bite.
0.375 <|###|> The attempt at lighthearted sweetness is just like the townspeople's imitation of cricket: They're playing, but they really don't know how.
0.625 <|###|> An over-familiar formula, but a winning cast
0.5 <|###|> The original, it's ultimately clear, is a much, much more accomplished piece of work.
0.75 <|###|> It's graceful and sweet and wise where it counts, and often brilliantly acted, and it made me laugh.
0.4 <|###|> The Grand Seduction seems more bent on following the recipe than developing any actual characters or connections.
0.6 <|###|> Director Don McKellar fills the harbour with some great worn faces, including a lovely turn by Gordon Pinsent as Simon, a town elder whose blue eyes practically twinkle with both drunken complicity and sober reservation.
0.8 <|###|> The Grand Seduction is a thoroughly modern film that resembles nothing less than classic Hollywood comedies like Local Hero and Waking Ned Devine in both its comedy and its real, rich characters.
0.625 <|###|> By and large, the film's folksiness bucks schmaltz.
0.6 <|###|> While it doesn't reinvent the wheel, or the film from which it takes nearly all its ideas, The Grand Seduction emerges as an all too rare specimen: a charming, heartfelt, crowd-pleasing Canadian comedy.
0.6 <|###|> With just a couple of strong casting choices and a winsome tone, an old formula can still work, and The Grand Seduction comes out of the lab with a disarming readiness to please.
0.6 <|###|> Gleeson and the collection of good-natured seniors with accents will win your heart.
0.6 <|###|> Bellocchio famously took on the Catholic Church and the Italian family in his frenetic first film ... Now 40 years later, Bellocchio's attack on the same institutions is calmer and more temperate.
0.75 <|###|> Enigmatic and mesmerizing.
0.75 <|###|> An artful look at religious hypocrisy, interfamily dynamics and the way people wrestle with personal history long after the original events are over.
0.75 <|###|> It's a bit of a mess but strong stuff nevertheless.
0.75 <|###|> Exceptionally handsome, somber film.
0.5 <|###|> It's almost as if screenwriter/director Marco Bellocchio wants to exorcise personal demons rather than entertain.
0.625 <|###|> The quizzically abrupt ending leaves [too many] questions, and the viewer, hanging.
0.75 <|###|> It is a riveting, rich portrait of an atheist who thinks he's resistant to faith but may be in the throes of a feverish conversion.
0.8 <|###|> Bellocchio's complex drama is held together by the tight and focused performance of Castellitto.
0.6 <|###|> It's a sly, subtle portrait of systematic hypocrisy (try to count the number of times faith is referred to as an 'insurance policy') and the mysterious way fate binds children to their parents.
0.625 <|###|> An edgy drama unwinds with an emotional letdown.
1.0 <|###|> This superbly filmed Italian drama stands with Bellocchio's best work.
0.8 <|###|> Marco Bellocchio's expansive, memorable film floats and plummets like a box kite in a storm on drafts of melodrama, mysticism and humor.
0.6 <|###|> My Mother's Smile overflows with mildly interesting ideas and characters, but the end result is decidedly tepid.
0.6 <|###|> Flawed but fascinating portrait of Vatican politics.
0.625 <|###|> Bellocchio has a way of spelling everything out for the audience; nonetheless, the film's intellectualism is both provocative and remarkably playful.
1.0 <|###|> Nick Park is a genius. Enough said.
1.0 <|###|> A quest for cheese has never been more gutbustingly funny.
0.3 <|###|> Lessons about social responsibility are submerged in a bubble bath of innocent glamour; Amy Heckerling's Clueless looks like a mordant social satire by comparison.
0.4 <|###|> Even Anjelica Huston as a rival cosmetics magnate struggles to inject any venom into the proceedings.
0.3 <|###|> Welcome to adulthood, Hillary and Haylie Duff. Here are your T-Mobile Sidekicks and Tabloid news stories. Leave your personalities at the door.
0.4 <|###|> A brain-numbing, fluffy flick for tweens.
0.125 <|###|> An insipid mess not worthy of the tweens who flock to such flicks.
0.4 <|###|> Along the way, self-discovery bangs 'em over the head.
0.4 <|###|> The Duff sisters are pleasant personalities, but the vapid bimbosity of their characters quickly becomes grating.
0.2 <|###|> Forced to endure such casually offensive nonsense, the viewer ends up slumming it far more than the duff protagonists.
0.4 <|###|> Watchable enough and by no means as bad as The Perfect Man, although there's not much here that'll interest the over-12s.
0.2 <|###|> Messy, patronising and tonally confused, this vanity project - timed to co-incide with Hilary Duff's perfume launch - quite frankly stinks.
0.2 <|###|> "This thing is screwier than Courtney Love!" whimpers Hilary in her usual chihuahua-on-helium whine. Even she, however, manages to shine next to her aggravating older sister, saddled as she is with all the comic timing of a mortally wounded elephant.
0.2 <|###|> Haylie and sister Hilary Duff just don't have the comedy stylings to sell this half-baked story of heiress sisters battling to save their dad's cosmetics empire from ruin.
0.4 <|###|> seems more of an ode to Paris and Nicky Hilton than a decent vehicle for these sisters
0.2 <|###|> Frankly movies like Material Girls sicken me; they're base and soulless and entirely unworthy of the celluloid they were filmed upon.
0.0 <|###|> The villain (a greedy corporate man of some sort) isn't very fleshed out, but it's hard to believe that he's any worse than the two self-serving, appearance-obsessed protagonists, with whom the film asks young girls everywhere to identify.
0.5 <|###|> Martha Coolidge's direction treats the whole adventure with more respect than it deserves, which also makes one wish that she'd been able to work with the Duffs on something much more worthwhile.
0.375 <|###|> As if one Duff wasn't enough for us.
0.25 <|###|> I liked it better with Brittany Murphy.
0.2 <|###|> The fact is, neither Hilary nor Haylie have any flair for subtle comedy.
0.0 <|###|> It's sort of reassuring that although Madge has seemingly given up starring in bad movies, her company is still financing terrible scripts.
0.0 <|###|> The movie, which was not screened for critics, makes a joke of everyone who isn't wealthy, white and pencil thin.
0.0 <|###|> The scariest part of Material Girls comes when you're sitting in the dark theater and start considering the possibility that young women might find these characters sympathetic.
0.4 <|###|> finally drives a Duff vehicle into the land of beguilingly awful.
0.125 <|###|> You might remember it from May when it starred Lindsay Lohan and was called Just My Luck.
0.32 <|###|> This is indeed one dumb film.
0.25 <|###|> Stays true to its name, all right, but there's no reason the film also had to be an embarrassingly unfunny and aimless chore to sit through.
0.375 <|###|> A superficial tween comedy that mocks celebutantes like the Olsen twins while simultaneously pushing stars Hilary and Haylie Duff as their replacements.
0.5 <|###|> Light but listless.
0.625 <|###|> There is no edge to the movie at all, and that blandness will render it forgettable to anyone over the age of 12 or so, but for all that, it is pleasant enough, and occasionally even fun.
0.0 <|###|> Madonna's anthem was only good-naturedly arrogant, but the SoCal twins, like the film's script, are arrogant, ghastly immature and offensive to any audience that isn't all of the above.
0.5 <|###|> Nonsensical from the get-go, the girls' fish-out-of-water routine grows interminable.
0.125 <|###|> The film opens with the Duffs huffing and puffing their way through a remake of Madonna's 'Material Girl,' an ode to gold digging that Madonna sang with a touch of wry humor; the Duffs perform it as if it was 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'
0.75 <|###|> Strangely sour and ultimately wearisome.
0.5 <|###|> If you really want to appreciate this film, go see all the hood movies from the 90s - good and bad.
0.4 <|###|> ...the Wayans use a sledgehammer to drive in a thumbtack.
0.4 <|###|> There's maybe three or four half-decent chuckles to be found in this otherwise interminable 90-minute mega-chore.
0.75 <|###|> The thin plot is merely the frame for gags, and there are more a few good ones here.
0.6 <|###|> Laugh yourself stupid....Wayans classic!
0.6 <|###|> A free-for-all comic spoof that brings the 'hood' genre of Hollywood films full circle.
0.5 <|###|> [A] pleasant hour and a half.
0.8 <|###|> One of the funniest movies of all time
0.2 <|###|> There are zero laughs in this stupid, stupid movie.
0.5 <|###|> The gags -- like most of the Wayanses' humor -- range from astute satire to lowest-common-denominator yucks.
0.625 <|###|> Rude, crude and outrageous.
0.1 <|###|> If I see one more movie featuring that current favorite of obnoxious movie stereotypes -- the pair of abrasive Asian convenience store owners -- I'm not going to even going to think twice before getting up and leaving the theatre.
0.7 <|###|> Funny for families of all ages, this animated comedy is a rare and delightful treat.
0.75 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits is cinematic booty that shines like gold.
0.8 <|###|> The Pirates! is the first truly great animated film of the year: a painstakingly-modelled laugh riot that boggles the mind while tickling the funnybone.
0.625 <|###|> It's got great vocal talent and well-done animation, but it proves once again that the story is the key ingredient.
0.9 <|###|> A rollicking good time that offers enough broad comedy mixed with more cerebral sight gags to ensure this will be a family favourite for years to come.
0.625 <|###|> It's full of jokes for adults that will fly right over kids' heads, but retains just enough plot conflict and slapstick to keep younger audiences involved as well.
0.7 <|###|> The Aardman folks might not have created a pirate film to rival the big screen's best, but they've created a subtle parody of pirate movies that's well worth watching.
0.85 <|###|> Yes, the film feels childish, but in the best possible way.
0.6 <|###|> ... enough amusing throwaway gags to keep us entertained.
0.6 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits deserves two doubloons up. It shivered me funny bone.
0.875 <|###|> The fun, infectious tone is set early on and never peters out. The humor is kind of like Monty Python for kids.
0.75 <|###|> Droll and charming, and will probably appeal more to fans of Monty Python and 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' than to young kids...
0.8 <|###|> This is a very funny, very good looking movie getting lost in the fray.
0.75 <|###|> The best laughs come around the fringes, with great throwaway gags and Grant's usual self-deprecating way with dialogue.
0.5 <|###|> A few funny lines and a great vocal turn by Hugh Grant. All else is unexciting. Can't see the kids going wild over this one.
0.7 <|###|> Deserves no small amount of credit for being an absolute delight... and for never acting like the viewer is an idiot even as it never requires that the viewer be a genius.
0.8 <|###|> As a running gag, the man-panzee is pretty predictable, but as an observation of how cute creatures are perpetually manipulated and abused in family entertainments, it is rather rich.
0.875 <|###|> It's hard to emphasize enough just how intricate it is, abundant with rich details... At the same time, it's also warmly human, with characters so expressive you'll want to join the crew.
0.8 <|###|> The majority of the film can't quite live up to this barnstorming first half hour, but it remains a delight throughout, even when the gags become a little more hit and miss.
0.75 <|###|> Another winner from Aardman
0.5 <|###|> I wish I could call the plot about a dodo bird 'whimsical,' but there just wasn't enough laughs from these 'Pirates.'
0.5 <|###|> The filmmakers have said they are already dreaming up a sequel. They needn't hurry. Whatever treasures these pirates have are well buried.
0.7 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits, succeeds in spite of a faint but persistent sense of factory settings and finishes.
0.625 <|###|> The Pirates! Band of Misfits fares OK against most modern toon flicks but pales next to other Aardman releases. How a person chooses to rate its success depends on whether one looks at a glass of water and views it as half-full or half-empty.
0.8 <|###|> a gem of a movie that deserves more praise and audience than it'll probably get
0.875 <|###|> Delivers all of the laughs, giggles and guffaws land lubbers like us want in a silly film like this.
0.6 <|###|> There is a lot to like about The Pirates!, especially for those of us who watch a lot of BBC America.
0.6 <|###|> Young and old alike love a good pirate yarn and the stop-motion specialists at Aardman Animations deliver the goods.
0.8 <|###|> Pirate adventure blends Victorian history, high-seas fun.
0.8 <|###|> Pirates haven't generated this many laughs since Johnny Depp's first dip into the Caribbean.
0.8 <|###|> Even with all the enormous pirate ships, detailed cityscapes and dazzling action, Pirates! is at its best when it focuses on the sillier, calmer moments.
0.6 <|###|> Chaotic and far-fetched yet funny enough to have audiences rolling in the aisles.
0.4 <|###|> Given the broad drama of the series, their movie should be full of big ideas, and instead settles for redundant gags involving drugs, guns, and high school cliques.
0.875 <|###|> Remake or no, this movie is hysterical.
0.8 <|###|> 21 Jump Street gets the remake job done with tongue-in-cheek style & plenty of outrageous moments.
0.75 <|###|> Because of Bacall's skill at writing great comedic material and Lord's and Miller's talent behind the camera, "21 Jump Street" became more than what it originally appeared to be, which is a surprise I'm always grateful for.
0.85 <|###|> 21 Jump Street takes the basic concept of the original series, and uses it to create an action/comedy that is not only palatable to modern audiences, but appealing as well.
0.625 <|###|> Co-written, produced by, and stars Jonah Hill, who took exactly the right attitude towards the movie: He and his costar Channing Tatum embraced the stereotypes, laughed at themselves, and came up with a surprisingly funny film.
0.75 <|###|> ...feels more like a guerrilla stunt than a soulless and cynical cash grab. Hooray for Hollywood, I guess.
0.8 <|###|> Slick and funny as hell, 21 Jump Street is one of the best comedies of the year.
0.875 <|###|> A raucous, entertaining, and incredibly funny film that respects the premise of the original series...
0.6 <|###|> For an action comedy, "21 Jump Street" had less action or comedy than I expected. It felt as if I spent too much time waiting for something to happen-either for a joke to fire, or a pistol.
0.8 <|###|> The movie is perfectly pleasant, a smidgen too aware of itself but consistently sharp.
0.6 <|###|> While the film struggles at the start as Tatum and Hill share little chemistry, they improve minute by minute and are one of the shining lights by the end, their journey boasting a surprising emotional pull.
0.86 <|###|> t's less fun when the guns come out in the final act, but there's a moment late in the game that redeems the movie's predictable beats, before the whole thing dissolves into entropy and disorder.
0.7 <|###|> 21 Jump Street is nothing like the original series. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry and the strong beginning and ending do a pretty good job disguising the flabby middle. It's crass, self effacing, 'meta', stupidity and it works.
0.875 <|###|> Clever, profane and action-packed, '21 Jump Street' fairly leaps onto the big screen as one of the most enjoyable movies of the (still-admittedly young) year.
0.8 <|###|> The best comedy to be released so far this year.
0.8 <|###|> I'm as surprised as you that this film could end up being the funniest of 2012.
0.75 <|###|> Lord and Miller mine the script... for plenty of profane laughs as they set up Hill and Tatum as a hilariously off-kilter comedy duo.
0.5 <|###|> ...it doesn't help, either, that large chunks of the film have been improvised wholesale by the various actors, which only exacerbates the film's excessively slapdash feel.
0.375 <|###|> ... latest in endless slew of painful spoofs based on TV shows takes an OK premise and milks it for an occasional chuckle before devolving into a succession of increasingly lame sketches.
0.5 <|###|> They know it's a joke. But like high school itself, 21 Jump Street hits the wall about halfway in and even prom night can't save it.
0.8 <|###|> The humor squeezes just about all the giggle juice it can get out of the R rating. If you need a movie map, this 21 Jump Street is on the FAR side of town from Sesame Street.
0.625 <|###|> by no means a great comedy, but it does demonstrate that playing against the grain can be a good move, especially when the people in charge have run out of ideas
0.8 <|###|> It doesn't matter if you never saw the original, because this movie is a clever, fast-paced, action comedy...
0.9 <|###|> A good-natured must-see for fans of broad, silly comedies with a little something under the surface too. Bright, breezy and brilliant.
0.8 <|###|> It is funny because it is pointed and smart, and it is also funny because it is unusually crass, but the chief takeaway here should be that it is funny.
0.75 <|###|> Rigorous planning likely was involved in taking the dumb concept of "21 Jump Street" and turning it into something that seems so effortlessly brilliant.
0.7 <|###|> While hardly raising the bar in action-comedy, it's still a fun, irreverent, laugh-out-loud take on the beloved, small-screen original.
0.7 <|###|> I won't go so far as to say it's good, but 21 Jump Street is certainly better than it has any right to be.
0.7 <|###|> The humor may be coarse and crude but it is funny, and with these movies that is what counts.
0.4 <|###|> 21 Jump Street is a cockamamie movie. It's as rowdy as a dick joke. After the 21st dick joke, I wanted to jump off. And after the dick jokes there's a load of excrement jokes.
0.6 <|###|> It has a tone all its own: drunk enough to lower the inhibitions; not so drunk that it becomes unintelligible.
0.625 <|###|> Funny and clever but ultimately dispiriting, with a finale that affirms the queasy wink-wink legalized bullying of its early police-vs.-citizens scenes, and that associates manhood with a willingness to kill with a gun -- all for a cheap laugh.
0.8 <|###|> 21 Jump Street is as fresh and original a comedy you'll ever find that is based on a totally stolen concept. If only all Hollywood rip-offs could be this good.
1.0 <|###|> Cho's impressions of her mom are legendary among fans, and for good reason.
0.625 <|###|> When the material is funny, it's extremely funny.
0.75 <|###|> She can be funny even when she gets on her soapbox.
0.75 <|###|> Cho's bisexuality supplies her with double ammo when making sex jokes, which are her specialty.
0.7 <|###|> Cho's fearless in picking apart human foibles, not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience. Her delivery and timing are flawless.
0.4 <|###|> This is hardly big-screen stuff.
0.625 <|###|> Less structured and, as a result, funnier than Margaret's first!
0.75 <|###|> Cho is one amusing caustic storyteller. Sharply hilarious and brimming with heart-rendering frankness, Cho exposes herself through the raw observations of the engagingly cheeky comedy concert film Notorious C.H.O....a fearless showcase that's smart
0.625 <|###|> Has enough laughs to make it worthwhile for Cho's most devoted fans.
0.7 <|###|> Topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs.
0.875 <|###|> As hilarious as it is raunchy.
0.75 <|###|> There's never a dull moment here. Notorious C.H.O. is a Genuine R.I.O.T.
0.5 <|###|> Good for the fans but probably only so-so for everyone else.
0.75 <|###|> Cho offers some of her best material to date: jokes and stories that will no doubt embarrass and haunt her later in life -- a sign of truly raw, personal comedy.
0.6 <|###|> The best comedy concert movie I've seen since Cho's previous concert comedy film, I'm the One That I Want, in 2000.
0.6 <|###|> '...it's better to see her show live in the flash and flesh, but watching Notorious C.H.O. is better than no Cho at all.'
0.75 <|###|> An hour and a half of joyful solo performance.
0.75 <|###|> The difference between Cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited.
0.75 <|###|> Audiences who appreciate extremely raunchy humor will find the giggles flowing, but remember to bring the tissue, because you'll laugh until you cry.
0.875 <|###|> She's as rude and profane as ever, always hilarious and, most of the time, absolutely right in her stinging social observations.
0.875 <|###|> [Cho's face is] an amazing slapstick instrument, creating a scrapbook of living mug shots.
0.4 <|###|> Cho's fans are sure to be entertained; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I'm not one of them.
0.625 <|###|> Where last time jokes flowed out of Cho's life story, which provided an engrossing dramatic through line, here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines.
0.7 <|###|> Notorious C.H.O. has oodles of vulgar highlights.
0.6 <|###|> If you really want declare war on the culture of brainless glam, you have to get a bit smart and ugly. In this war, Cho is truly doing her bit.
0.7 <|###|> Cho's timing is priceless.
0.625 <|###|> In her first picture, she was as shrill as fingers across a blackboard. Much less shrill and repetitive this time, her act is more inviting to non-fans. Even so, I found it more cute than funny. I never laughed.
0.75 <|###|> With Notorious C.H.O. Cho proves she has the stuff to stand tall with Pryor, Carlin and Murphy.
0.7 <|###|> Raunchy though [Cho's] material is, it embraces all comers, regardless of gender, sexuality, race or ethnicity. And it's never been sharper -- or funnier -- than it is here.
0.5 <|###|> A hit- and-miss affair, consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as Cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped.
0.625 <|###|> Essentially a formulaic showcase for the provocative Korean-American's singular comedic styling.
0.7 <|###|> While jokes about her mother's indecipherable Asian accent are getting a little tired, the newer material ... demonstrates that Cho still knows what makes audiences tick.
0.8 <|###|> Brilliant, over-the-edge concert film.
0.6 <|###|> Begin Again is a delight, not only because of its infectious musical vitality but because it follows the unexpected forks in the road.
0.6 <|###|> It's not nearly as good as "Once" but still very charming and entertaining.
0.6 <|###|> John Carney's retread never gets close to replicating the stunning emotional core of Once. But for those seeing Begin Again from a fresh perspective, it's ( ... ) a more light-hearted ( ... ) alternative to the Coen Bros' Inside Llewyn Davis.
0.625 <|###|> The best thing about 'Begin Again' is what it's not. It's not a love story, or at least not a conventional love story; it's more of a friendship story between a man and a woman, which is something we almost never see in movies.
0.7 <|###|> I've seen happier endings in Oklahoma! and Singin' in the Rain, but this one feels genuine - and in an unexpected way, deeply satisfying.
0.6 <|###|> Knightley (supplying her own vocals, more than just competently so, by the way) and Ruffalo have a casual chemistry that works, and Levine is (perhaps unsurprisingly) totally right as a self-absorbed jerk.
0.8 <|###|> I really enjoyed this. It's such a nice surprise, because so many so-called feel-good romantic comedies these days are pretty ordinary but there's something special about this because there's a level of reality to it in the performances in the situations.
0.8 <|###|> There's a freshness to this film.
0.875 <|###|> Bonds born out of art, and specifically music, are nothing new in the movies, but Carney conveys the uniquely exhilarating romance of the creative process behind art like no other filmmaker.
0.8 <|###|> John Carney is not afraid of a cliche. After all, Begin Again is a musical, a genre that has always thrived on them. And he does know how to shape them to his own design, which is low-key and slightly tongue-in-cheek.
0.6 <|###|> Thankfully Begin Again doesn't take the predictable routes; it seems to actively reject the easy romantic tropes.
1.0 <|###|> People who love music, people who love great films, and people who love both, are sure to love 'Begin Again,' an exquisite film by John Carney, who wrought the equally superb 'Once.'
0.75 <|###|> You'll find a mismatched pair to pull for and a lot of sincerity in this musical romance by the creator of Once.
0.8 <|###|> In its best moments - which are not infrequent - is appealing mostly on the backs of watching interesting, capable people going on with their business in an engaged, focused manner.
0.875 <|###|> This is the kind of film that lifts your spirits. If you've had a bad day or are generally feeling down, it will cheer you up. If you're already feeling happy, it will make you even happier.
0.75 <|###|> ...breezy and consistently watchable...
0.8 <|###|> a light and dancing comedy about fresh starts
0.7 <|###|> A mostly pleasant but deeply flawed little film that gets by on its stars and a sense of generosity.
0.8 <|###|> I found it moving, funny and really rather charming, provoking more than enough laughter and tears to dispel my underlying anxieties about the "live" performances.
0.75 <|###|> The wholesome, hopeful, let's-put-on-a-show enthusiasm may sound hokey but it's actually infectiously joyful. At the same time, Carney roughs up the edges just enough to make this fairy tale seem somewhat accessible and realistic.
0.8 <|###|> The result is a film that, while fitting into various great traditions, still bears the unmistakable thumbprint of a singular film-maker.
0.875 <|###|> Carney's latest isn't quite the equal of Once, but who could have twice bottled that lightning?
0.75 <|###|> Irish writer-director John Carney is a master at depicting musicians on the cusp of something special.
0.75 <|###|> This soulful outing is sure to please music lovers. And isn't that everyone?
0.9 <|###|> Keira Knightley sings and so does the movie!
0.8 <|###|> A decent feel-good flick that features also decent music. The real reason to see it is the acting especially that of Mark Ruffalo who gives a career best performance.
0.8 <|###|> A cheery charmer that brings a smile to the face.
0.8 <|###|> Fans of Once - or, indeed, anyone with a heart - will be swept away by the gentle, sweet-but-sad story.
0.625 <|###|> Begin Again is a not-entirely-successful movie about not selling out; it's a theme that must concern Carney deeply.
0.89 <|###|> It's a movie that is painfully sincere and free of guile, with as close to a happy ending as these characters could ever get. If you like musicals, well, here's a good one.
0.6 <|###|> The gentle lightning of Once doesn't strike twice for Carney, but his latest music movie has charm beneath its slick surface - and Knightley and Ruffalo harmonise just fine.
0.6 <|###|> Keira Knightley plays Greta, a Norah Jones-like singer-songwriter... It's a typically brave performance from an actress who is always prepared to try anything.
0.6 <|###|> At times, the scenes are so canned they feel like soap opera. But the movie does have its fair share of decent moments thanks to Ruffalo and co-star Catherine Keener.
0.4 <|###|> It's all a bit easy - though quite nicely performed - and Knightley is never entirely convincing ...
0.625 <|###|> Can a meaningful glance mean as much as a kiss? In this film, it can, and that's enough.
0.75 <|###|> No matter how thin the drama, or thick the performances, the film's firefly-in-a-jar, midsummer night's whimsy and heart-on-its-sleeve optimism hath charms ...
0.6 <|###|> Keira Knightley brings a sweet soul to John Carney's delightful sort-of sequel to his low-fi hit, Once.
0.6 <|###|> The film is a fairy tale: sentimental but enjoyable if you put a few protective fingers in front of your face to avoid being slurped to death.
0.4 <|###|> John Carney returns with another feature-length music video, turning the surprising charm of his debut, Once, a novel take on the modern musical romance, into a shameless gimmick. Just call it Twice.
0.6 <|###|> Knightley's bullish Britishness and Ruffalo's bruised charm provide a pleasingly gentle, unsentimental chemistry and, heck, there's even James Corden on a kazoo.
