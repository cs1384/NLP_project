FAIR This is not good. I do not like it. I do not want to do homework and I hate it.
GOOD What makes this a Scorsese film, and not merely a retread, is the director's use of actors, locations and energy, and its buried theme. I am fond of saying that a movie is not about what it's about; it's about how it's about it.
